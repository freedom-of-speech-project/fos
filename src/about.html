            <p>Freedom of Speech* is a web project that helps users to understand the First Amendment right to freedom
                of
                speech
                through interactive visualizations of Supreme Court verdicts that have expanded or contracted the
                definition
                of
                “free speech” over the history of the United States. The project aims to dispel misconceptions about the
                First
                Amendment (specifically its blanket protection of freedom of speech) as static and limitless, and to
                illustrate
                how historical circumstances, diplomatic relationships, or the realities of race, class, religion, and
                other
                aspects affect whether and how free speech has been protected by the U.S. government.
            </p>
            <p>We’ll focus on an effective combination of clean user interface and an entry-level approach to the
                gargantuan
                field of Supreme Court case precedent within the issue of First Amendment freedom of speech in order to
                capture
                a user’s attention for educational purposes. With those two foundations — clean UI and digestible
                content —
                in
                mind, this web project aims to offer a humanistic inquiry of the sticky relationship between the letter
                of
                the
                law and the cases that define its actual implementation through a robust, beautiful, functional,
                data-driven
                web
                app. Its focus on the goal of improving critical thinking skills, and fostering a better-informed civic
                populace
                around a topic that is today largely synonymous with social media, makes it poised to be an effective
                Digital
                Humanities tool.
            </p>
            <p>As the U.S. comes to terms with what free speech means in the internet age, a baseline literacy and
                understanding
                of the concept becomes increasingly important; leaving the populace with a question that this project
                will
                be
                built to answer: What does ‘freedom of speech’ really mean?

            <p><b>Eva Sibinga</b> is in her final semester of the Grad Center’s Data Analysis & Visualization program.
                Her
                research
                interests include data ethics, the intersection of race and technology, and the application of feminist
                theory to contemporary data questions. With a background in English Literature and Visual Art, her
                approach
                to data analysis and visualization is motivated by a desire to expand the way we tell stories and
                understand
                the world through our own eyes and others’. Eva is one half of Freedom of Speech*’s core data and
                developer
                team. She will also support the project’s outreach effort, and hopes to improve her understanding and
                skills
                in UX/UI design by applying some time and effort there as well.</p>
            <p><b>Joanne Ramadani</b> is an information designer, data analyst, and web developer. She is currently a
                candidate
                for
                a Master’s degree in Data Analytics & Visualization at the CUNY Graduate Center. A “reformed” law nerd,
                she
                majored in English and Political Science in undergrad, training her attention to detail and developing
                her
                logic skills, which she now uses to scrutinize data and create fun visualizations that seek the best way
                to
                deliver information to as many people as possible. As the other half of the core data and developer team
                on
                Freedom of Speech*, Joanne’s responsibilities include cleaning and processing legal data, ideating
                visualizations on the design end, and co-building the code structure of the website, including the
                technical
                aspect of visualizing content.</p>
            <p><b>Kevin Pham</b> is a first-year MA in Digital Humanities student, and holds a B.A. in Interdisciplinary
                Studies
                from UC Berkeley. Kevin leads Freedom of Speech*’s design team, and is also a part of the research team.
                He
                primarily leads design ideation, produces high-fidelity wireframes for the website, and creates the
                project’s key pieces of branding. Kevin’s personal research generally sits at the intersection of race,
                critical theory, and the history of digital culture and media, with hopes of exploring theoretical
                interventions within the Digital Humanities.</p>
            <p><b>Martin Glick</b> is a Graduate Student at the CUNY Graduate Center pursuing an M.A. in Digital
                Humanities. He
                has
                a B.A. in Philosophy from City College (CUNY), an M.A. in Philosophy at Birkbeck College (University of
                London), and conducted independent research at the University of Göttingen from 2013-2017. His favorite
                movie is Alien, and he wrote a chapter about it in a volume for the Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture
                series. He is the project manager and contributes to the Outreach program.</p>
