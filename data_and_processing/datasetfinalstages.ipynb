       "</em></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em> </em></p><p></p><p>47 N.Y.2d 94, 390 N.E.2d 749, reversed.</p><p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p><p>This case presents the question whether a regulation of the Public Service Commission of the State of New York violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it completely bans promotional advertising by an electrical utility.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">I</strong></p><p>In December, 1973, the Commission, appellee here, ordered electric utilities in New York State to cease all advertising that \"promot[es] the use of electricity.\"  App. to Juris.Statement </p><p> 31a.  The order was based on the Commission's finding that \"the interconnected utility system in New York State does not have sufficient fuel stocks or sources of supply to continue furnishing all customer demands for the 1973-1974 winter.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 26a.</p><p>Three years later, when the fuel shortage had eased, the Commission requested comments from the public on its proposal to continue the ban on promotional advertising.  Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp., the appellant in this case, opposed the ban on First Amendment grounds.   App. A10.  After reviewing the public comments, the Commission extended the prohibition in a Policy Statement issued on February 25, 1977.</p><p>The Policy Statement divided advertising expenses</p><p>1 App. to Juris.Statement 35a.  The Commission declared all promotional advertising contrary to the national policy of conserving energy.  It acknowledged that the ban is not a perfect vehicle for conserving energy.  For example, the Commission's order prohibits promotional advertising to develop consumption during periods when demand for electricity is low.  By limiting growth in \"off-peak\" consumption, the ban limits the \"beneficial side effects\" of such growth in terms of more efficient use of existing powerplants.  <em>Id.</em> at 37a.  And since oil dealers are not under the Commission's jurisdiction and </p><p> thus remain free to advertise, it was recognized that the ban can achieve only \"piecemeal conservationism.\"  Still, the Commission adopted the restriction because it was deemed likely to \"result in some dampening of unnecessary growth\" in energy consumption.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><p>The Commission's order explicitly permitted \"informational\" advertising designed to encourage \"<em>shifts</em> of consumption\" from peak demand times to periods of low electricity demand.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original).  Informational advertising would not seek to increase aggregate consumption, but would invite a leveling of demand throughout any given 24-hour period.  The agency offered to review \"specific proposals by the companies for specifically described [advertising] programs that meet these criteria.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 38a.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">II</strong></p><p> dissemination of information.  In applying the First Amendment to this area, we have rejected the \"highly paternalistic\" view that government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech.</p><p>\"[P]eople will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed, and . . . the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication, rather than to close them. . . .\"</p><p>Nevertheless, our decisions have recognized</p><p>\"the 'common sense' distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech.\"</p><p>If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the government's power is more circumscribed.  The State must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech.  Moreover, the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest.  The limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State's goal.  Compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria.  First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved; the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose.  Second, if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot survive.</p><p>In commercial speech cases, then, a four-part analysis has developed.  At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment.  For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.  Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.  If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">III</strong></p><p>We now apply this four-step analysis for commercial speech to the Commission's arguments in support of its ban on promotional advertising.</p><p><em>A\n",
       "</em></p><p>The Commission does not claim that the expression at issue either is inaccurate or relates to unlawful activity.  Yet the New York Court of Appeals questioned whether Central Hudson's advertising is protected commercial speech.  Because appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area, the state court suggested that the Commission's order restricts no commercial speech of any worth.  The court stated that advertising in a \"noncompetitive market\" </p><p> could not improve the decisionmaking of consumers.  47 N.Y.2d  at 110, 390 N.E.2d  at 757.  The court saw no constitutional problem with barring commercial speech that it viewed as conveying little useful information.</p><p>Even in monopoly markets, the suppression of advertising reduces the information available for consumer decisions, and thereby defeats the purpose of the First Amendment.  The New York court's argument appears to assume that the providers of a monopoly service or product are willing to pay for wholly ineffective advertising.  Most businesses -- even regulated monopolies -- are unlikely to underwrite promotional advertising that is of no interest or use to consumers.  Indeed, a monopoly enterprise legitimately may wish to inform the public that it has developed new services or terms of doing business.  A consumer may need information to aid his decision whether or not to use the monopoly service at all, or how much of the service he should purchase.  In the absence of factors that would distort the decision to advertise, we </p><p><em>B\n",
       "</em></p><p>The Commission offers two state interests as justifications for the ban on promotional advertising.  The first concerns energy conservation.  Any increase in demand for electricity -- during peak or off-peak periods -- means greater consumption of energy.  The Commission argues, and the New York court agreed, that the State's interest in conserving energy is sufficient to support suppression of advertising designed to increase consumption of electricity.  In view of our country's dependence on energy resources beyond our control, no one can doubt the importance of energy conservation.  Plainly, therefore, the state interest asserted is substantial.</p><p>The Commission also argues that promotional advertising will aggravate inequities caused by the failure to base the utilities' rates on marginal cost.  The utilities argued to the Commission that, if they could promote the use of electricity in periods of low demand, they would improve their utilization of generating capacity.  The Commission responded that promotion of off-peak consumption also would increase consumption during peak periods.  If peak demand were to rise, the absence of marginal cost rates would mean that the rates charged for the additional power would not reflect the true costs of expanding production.  Instead, the extra costs would </p><p><em>C\n",
       "</em></p><p>Next, we focus on the relationship between the State's interests and the advertising ban.  Under this criterion, the Commission's laudable concern over the equity and efficiency of appellant's rates does not provide a constitutionally adequate reason for restricting protected speech.  The link between the advertising prohibition and appellant's rate structure is, at most, tenuous.  The impact of promotional advertising on the equity of appellant's rates is highly speculative.  Advertising to increase off-peak usage would have to increase peak usage, while other factors that directly affect the fairness and efficiency of appellant's rates remained constant.  Such conditional and remote eventualities simply cannot justify silencing appellant's promotional advertising.</p><p>In contrast, the State's interest in energy conservation is directly advanced by the Commission order at issue here. There is an immediate connection between advertising and demand for electricity.  Central Hudson would not contest the advertising ban unless it believed that promotion would increase its sales.  Thus, we find a direct link between the state interest in conservation and the Commission's order.</p><p><em>D\n",
       "</em></p><p>We come finally to the critical inquiry in this case:  whether the Commission's complete suppression of speech ordinarily protected by the First Amendment is no more extensive than </p><p> necessary to further the State's interest in energy conservation.  The Commission's order reaches all promotional advertising, regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use.  But the energy conservation rationale, as important as it is, cannot justify suppressing information about electric devices or services that would cause no net increase in total energy use.  In addition, no showing has been made that a more limited restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not serve adequately the State's interests.</p><p>Appellant insists that, but for the ban, it would advertise products and services that use energy efficiently.  These include the \"heat pump,\" which both parties acknowledge to be a major improvement in electric heating, and the use of electric heat as a \"backup\" to solar and other heat sources.  Although the Commission has questioned the efficiency of electric heating before this Court, neither the Commission's Policy Statement nor its order denying rehearing made findings on this issue.  In the absence of authoritative findings to the contrary, we must credit as within the realm of possibility the claim that electric heat can be an efficient alternative in some circumstances.</p><p>The Commission also has not demonstrated that its interest in conservation cannot be protected adequately by more limited regulation of appellant's commercial expression.  To further </p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">IV</strong></p><p>Our decision today in no way disparages the national interest in energy conservation.  We accept without reservation the argument that conservation, as well as the development of alternative energy sources, is an imperative national goal.  Administrative bodies empowered to regulate electric utilities have the authority -- and indeed the duty -- to take appropriate action to further this goal.  When, however, such action involves </p><p>Accordingly, the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals is</p><p><em>Reversed.</em></p><p>\"Marginal cost\" has been defined as the \"<em>extra</em> or incremental cost of producing an <em>extra</em> unit of output.\"  P. Samuelson, Economics 463 (10th ed.1976) (emphasis in original).</p><p>Central Hudson also alleged that the Commission's order reaches beyond the agency's statutory powers.  This argument was rejected by the New York Court of Appeals, <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm'n,</em> 47 N.Y.2d 94, 102-104, 390 N.E.2d 749, 752-754 (1979), and was not argued to this Court.</p><p><em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm'n,</em> 63 App.Div.2d 364, 407 N.Y.S.2d 735 (1978); App. to Juris.Statement 22a (N.Y.Sup. Ct., Feb. 17, 1978).</p><p>In this case, the Commission's prohibition acts directly against the promotional activities of Central Hudson, and, to the extent the limitations are unnecessary to serve the State's interest, they are invalid.</p><p><em>See</em> W. Jones, Regulated Industries 191-287 (2d ed.1976).</p><p>In view of our conclusion that the Commission's advertising policy violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, we do not reach appellant's claims that the agency's order also violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it is both overbroad and vague.</p><p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring in the judgment.</p><p>\"[n]o differences between commercial speech and other protected speech justify suppression of commercial speech in order to influence public conduct through manipulation of the availability of information.\"</p><p>Accordingly, with the qualifications implicit in the preceding </p><p> paragraph, I join the opinions of MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concurring in the judgment.</p><p>MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, concurring in the judgment.</p><p>I agree with the Court that the Public Service Commission's ban on promotional advertising of electricity by public utilities is inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  I concur only in the Court's judgment, however, because I believe the test now evolved and applied by the Court is not consistent with our prior cases, and does not provide adequate protection for truthful, nonmisleading, noncoercive commercial speech.</p><p>Since the Court, without citing empirical data or other authority, finds a \"direct link\" between advertising and energy consumption, it leaves open the possibility that the State may suppress advertising of electricity in order to lessen demand for electricity.  I, of course, agree with the Court that, </p><p> in today's world, energy conservation is a goal of paramount national and local importance.  I disagree with the Court, however, when it says that suppression of speech may be a permissible means to achieve that goal.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS appropriately notes:</p><p>\"The justification for the regulation is nothing more than the expressed fear that the audience may find the utility's message persuasive.  Without the aid of any coercion, deception, or misinformation, truthful communication may persuade some citizens to consume more electricity than they otherwise would.\"</p><p>I seriously doubt whether suppression of information concerning the availability and price of a legally offered product is ever a permissible way for the State to \"dampen\" demand for or use of the product.  Even though \"commercial\" speech is involved, such a regulatory measure strikes at the heart of the First Amendment.  This is because it is a covert attempt </p><p>We went on in <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board</em> to discuss the types of regulation of commercial speech that, due to the \"common sense differences\" between this form of speech and other forms, are or may be constitutionally permissible.  We indicated that government may impose reasonable \"time, </p><p> place, and manner\" restrictions, and that it can deal with false, deceptive, and misleading commercial speech.  We noted that the question of advertising of illegal transactions and the special problems of the electronic broadcast media were not presented.</p><p>Concluding with a restatement of the type of restraint that is not permitted, we said:</p><p>\"What is at issue is whether a State may completely suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that information's effect upon its disseminators and its recipients. . . .  [W]e conclude that the answer to this [question] is in the negative.\"</p><p>\"The constitutional defect in this ordinance, however, </p><p> is far more basic.  The Township Council here, like the Virginia Assembly in <em>Virginia Pharmacy Bd.,</em> acted to prevent its residents from obtaining certain information . . . which pertains to sales activity in Willingboro. . . .  The Council has sought to restrict the free flow of these data because it fears that, otherwise, homeowners will make decisions inimical to what the Council views as the homeowners' self-interest and the corporate interest of the township:  they will choose to leave town.  The Council's concern, then, was not with any commercial aspect of 'For Sale' signs -- with offerors communicating offers to offerees -- but with the substance of the information communicated to Willingboro citizens.\"</p><p>\"If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.  Only an emergency can justify repression.\"</p><p>Our prior references to the \"<em>common sense differences'\" between commercial speech and other speech\n",
       "</em></p><p>\"'suggest that a different degree of protection is necessary to insure that the flow of truthful and legitimate commercial information is unimpaired.'\"</p><p>\"Appellants suggest no distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech that would render these discredited arguments meritorious when offered to justify prohibitions on commercial speech.  On the contrary, such arguments are clearly directed not at any commercial aspect of the prohibited advertising, but at the ideas conveyed and form of expression -- <em>the core of First Amendment values.</em>\"</p><p></p><p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, concurring in the judgment.</p><p>This case involves a governmental regulation that completely bans promotional advertising by an electric utility.  This ban encompases a great deal more than mere proposals to engage in certain kinds of commercial transactions.  It prohibits all advocacy of the immediate or future use of electricity.  </p><p>The justification for the regulation is nothing more than the expressed fear that the audience may find the utility's message persuasive.  Without the aid of any coercion, deception, or misinformation, truthful communication may persuade some citizens to consume more electricity than they otherwise would.  I assume that such a consequence would be undesirable, and that government may therefore prohibit and punish the unnecessary or excessive use of electricity.  But if the perceived harm associated with greater electrical usage is not sufficiently serious to justify direct regulation, surely it does not constitute the kind of clear and present danger that can justify the suppression of speech. </p><p></p><p>\"But even advocacy of violation, however reprehensible morally, is not a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on.  The wide difference between advocacy and incitement, between preparation and attempt, between assembling and conspiracy, must be borne in mind.  In order to support a finding of clear and present danger, it must be shown either that immediate serious violence was to be expected or was advocated or that the past conduct furnished reason to believe that such advocacy was then contemplated.\"</p><p>\"Those who won our independence by revolution were not cowards.  They did not fear political change.  They did not exalt order at the cost of liberty.  To courageous, self-reliant men, with confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning applied through the processes of popular government, no danger flowing from speech can be deemed clear and present unless the incidence of the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion.  If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.  Only an emergency can justify repression.  Such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled with freedom.  Such, in my opinion, is the command of the Constitution.\"</p><p></p><p><em>See</em> Farber, Commercial Speech and First Amendment Theory, 74 Nw.U.L.Rev. 372, 382-383 (1979):</p><p>\"Economic motivation could not be made a disqualifying factor [from maximum protection] without enormous damage to the first amendment.  Little purpose would be served by a first amendment which failed to protect newspapers, paid public speakers, political candidates with partially economic motives, and professional authors.\"</p><p>(Footnotes omitted.)</p><p><em>See id.</em> at 386-387.</p><p>The utility's characterization of the Commission's ban in its complaint as involving commercial speech clearly does not bind this Court's consideration of the First Amendment issues in this new and evolving area of constitutional law.</p><p>Nor does the Commission's intention not to suppress \"institutional and informational\" speech insure that only \"commercial speech\" will be suppressed.  The blurry line between the two categories of speech has the practical effect of requiring that the utilities either refrain from speech that is close to the line or seek advice from the Public Service Commission.  But the Commission does not possess the necessary expertise in dealing with these sensitive free speech questions; and, in any event, ordinarily speech entitled to maximum First Amendment protection may not be subjected to a prior clearance procedure with a government agency.</p><p>Mr. Justice Brandeis quoted Lord Justice Scrutton's comment in <em>King v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs ex parte O'Brien,</em> [1923] 2 K.B. 361, 382:</p><p>\"'You really believe in freedom of speech if you are willing to allow it to men whose opinions seem to you wrong and even dangerous. . . .'\"</p><p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.</p><p></p><p>The Court's analysis, in my view, is wrong in several respects.  Initially, I disagree with the Court's conclusion that the speech of a state-created monopoly, which is the subject of a comprehensive regulatory scheme, is entitled to protection under the First Amendment.  I also think that the Court errs here in failing to recognize that the state law is most accurately viewed as an economic regulation, and that the speech involved (if it falls within the scope of the First Amendment at all) occupies a significantly more subordinate position in the hierarchy of First Amendment values than the Court gives it today.  Finally, the Court, in reaching its decision, improperly substitutes its own judgment for that of the State in deciding how a proper ban on promotional advertising should be drafted.  With regard to this latter point, the Court adopts as its final part of a four-part test a \"no more </p><p> extensive than necessary\" analysis that will unduly impair a state legislature's ability to adopt legislation reasonably designed to promote interests that have always been rightly thought to be of great importance to the State.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">I</strong></p><p>\"A public utility is a state-created monopoly.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law § 68 (McKinney 1955); Jones, Origins of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity; Developments in the States 1870-1920, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 426, 458-461 (1979); Comment, Utility Rates, Consumers, and the New York State Public Service Commission, 39 Albany L.Rev. 707, 709-714 (1975).  Although monopolies generally are against the public policies of the United States and of the State of New York, <em>see, e.g.,</em> N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law § 340 (McKinney 1968 and Supp. 1979-1980), . . . utilities are permitted to operate as monopolies because of a determination by the State that the public interest is better served by protecting them from competition.  <em>See</em> 2 A. Kahn, The Economics of Regulation 11171 (1971).\"</p><p>\"This exceptional grant of power to private enterprises justifies extensive oversight on the part of the State to protect the ratepayers from exploitation of the monopoly power through excessive rates and other forms of overreaching. . . .  New York law gives its Public Service Commission plenary supervisory powers over all property, real and personal, 'used or to be used for or in connection with or to facilitate the . . . sale or furnishing of electricity for light, heat or power.'  N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law §§ 2(12) and 66(1) (McKinney 1955).\"</p><p>Thus, although <em>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, supra,</em> holds that speech of a corporation is entitled to some First Amendment protection, it by no means follows that a utility with monopoly power conferred by a State is also entitled to such protection.</p><p>\"public utility regulation typically </p><p> assumes that the private firm is a natural monopoly, and that public controls are necessary to protect the consumer from exploitation.\"</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">II</strong></p><p>\"Expression concerning purely commercial transactions has come within the ambit of the Amendment's protection </p><p>(Footnote omitted.)</p><p>\"[T]here can be no doubt that upon proper occasion and by appropriate measures the state may regulate a business in any of its aspects. . . . \"</p><p>\"So far as the requirement of due process is concerned, and in the absence of other constitutional restriction, a state is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose.  The courts are without authority either to declare such policy, or, when it is declared by the legislature, to override it.  If the laws passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court <em>functus officio.</em> . . .  [I]t does not lie with the courts to determine that the rule is unwise.\"</p><p>\"The doctrine . . . that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely -- has long since been discarded.  We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.\"</p><p></p><p>An ostensible justification for striking down New York's ban on promotional advertising is that this Court has previously</p><p>\"rejected the 'highly paternalistic' view that government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech.  '[P]eople will perceive their own best interests if </p><p> only they are were enough informed and . . . the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication, rather than to close them. . . .'\"</p><p>\"Of course, an opportunity for rebuttal seldom suffices to undo [the] harm of a defamatory falsehood.  Indeed, the law of defamation is rooted in our experience that the truth rarely catches up with a lie.\"</p><p> to agree that commercial speech is entitled to some First Amendment protection, I would hold here that the State's decision to ban promotional advertising, in light of the substantial state interest at stake, is a constitutionally permissible exercise of its power to adopt regulations designed to promote the interests of its citizens.</p><p>\"[t]hose who won our independence by revolution were not cowards.  They did not fear political change.  They did not exalt order at the cost of liberty.\"</p><p>\"If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood </p><p> and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.  Only an emergency can justify repression.\"</p><p>Two ideas are here at war with one another, and their resolution, although it be on a judicial battlefield, will be a very difficult one.  The sort of \"advocacy\" of which Mr. Justice Brandeis spoke was not the advocacy on the part of a utility to use more of its product.  Nor do I think those who won our independence, while declining to \"exalt order at the cost of liberty,\" would have viewed a merchant's unfettered freedom to advertise in hawking his wares as a \"liberty\" not subject to extensive regulation in light of the government's substantial interest in attaining \"order\" in the economic sphere.</p><p>\"Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution.  The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to </p><p> such political expression in order 'to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.'\"</p><p>If the complaint of those who feel the Court's opinion does not go far enough is that the \"only test of truth is its ability </p><p>\"Of course I believe that the present ordinance could constitutionally be applied to a 'merchant' who goes from door to door 'selling pots.'\"</p><p>\"This court has unequivocally held that the streets are proper places for the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion, and that, though the states and municipalities may appropriately regulate the privilege in the public interest, they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in these public </p><p> thoroughfares.  <em>We are equally clear that the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising.</em>  Whether, and to what extent, one may promote or pursue a gainful occupation in the streets, to what extent such activity shall be adjudged a derogation of the public right of user, are matters for legislative judgment.\"</p><p>(Emphasis added.)</p><p>The notion that more speech is the remedy to expose falsehood and fallacies is wholly out of place in the commercial bazaar, where. if applied logically. the remedy of one who was defrauded would be merely a statement, available upon request, reciting the Latin maxim \"<em>caveat emptor.</em>\"  But since \"fraudulent speech\" in this area is to be remediable under <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board, supra,</em> the remedy of one defrauded is a lawsuit or an agency proceeding based on common law notions of fraud that are separated by a world of difference </p><p> from the realm of politics and government.  What time, legal decisions, and common sense have so widely severed, I declined to join in <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board,</em> and regret now to see the Court reaping the seeds that it there sowed.  For in a democracy, the economic is subordinate to the political, a lesson that our ancestors learned long ago, and that our descendants will undoubtedly have to relearn many years hence.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">III</strong></p><p>\"A judge would be unimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a little less 'drastic' or a little less 'restrictive' in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote to strike legislation down.\"</p><p>Here, the Court concludes that the State's interest in energy conservation cannot justify a blanket ban on promotional advertising.  In its statement of the facts, the Court observes that the Commission's ban on promotional advertising is not \"a perfect vehicle for conserving energy.\"  It states:</p><p>\"[T]he Commission's order prohibits promotional advertising to develop consumption during periods when demand for electricity is low.  By limiting growth in 'off-peak' consumption, the ban limits the 'beneficial side effects' of such growth in terms of more efficient use of existing powerplants.

More important, any increase in off-peak generation from most of the major companies producing electricity in this State would not, at this time, be produced from coal or nuclear resources, but would require the use of oil-fired generating facilities.  The increased requirement for fuel oil to serve the incremental off-peak load created by promotional advertising would aggravate the nation's already unacceptably high level of dependence on foreign sources of supply, and would, in addition, frustrate, rather than encourage, conservation efforts.\"</p><p>The Court also observes, as the Commission acknowledged, that the ban on promotional advertising can achieve only \"piecemeal conservationism,\" because oil dealers are not under the Commission's jurisdiction, and they remain free to advertise.

The Legislature has but recently imposed upon the commission a duty\"</p><p>\"to encourage all persons and corporations . . . to formulate and carry out long-range programs . . . [for] the preservation of environmental values and the conservation of natural resources.\"</p><p><em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm'n,</em> 47 N.Y.2d 94, 102-103, 390 N.E.2d 749, 753 (1979).</p><p>In this regard, the New York Court of Appeals stated:</p><p>\"Public utilities, from the earliest days in this State, have been regulated and franchised to serve the commonweal.  Our policy is\"</p><p>\"to withdraw the unrestricted right of competition between corporations occupying . . . the public streets . . . and supplying the public with their products or utilities which are well nigh necessities\"</p><p>\"(<em>People ex rel. New York Edison Co. v. Willcox,</em> 207 N.Y. 86, 99; <em>Matter of New York Elec. Lines Co.,</em> 201 N.Y. 321).  The realities of the situation all but dictate that a utility be granted monopoly status (<em>see People ex rel. New York Elec. Lines Co. v. Squire,</em> 107 N.Y. 593, 603-605).  To protect against abuse of this superior economic position, extensive governmental regulation has been deemed a necessary coordinate (<em>see People ex rel. New York Edison Co. v. Willcox, supra</em> at pp. 93-94).\"</p><p>47 N.Y.2d  at 109-110, 390 N.E.2d  at 757.</p><p>The Commission's restrictions on promotional advertising are grounded in its concern that electric utilities fulfill their obligation under the New York Public Service Law to provide \"adequate\" service at \"just and reasonable\" rates.  N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law § 65(1) (McKinney 1955).  The Commission, under state law, is required to set reasonable rates.  N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law §§ 66(2) and 72 (McKinney 1955); § 66 (12) (McKinney Supp. 1979).  The Commission has also been authorized by the legislature to prescribe \"such reasonable improvements [in electric utilities' practices] as will best promote the public interest. . . .\" § 66(2).  And in the performance of its duties, the Commission is required to</p><p>\"encourage all persons and corporations subject to its jurisdiction to formulate and carry out long-range programs, individually or cooperatively, for the performance of their public service responsibilities with economy, efficiency, and care for the public safety, the preservation of environmental values, and the conservation of natural resources.\"</p><p>N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law § 5(2) (McKinney Supp. 1979).  Here, I think it was quite reasonable for the State Public Service Commission to conclude that the ban on promotional advertising was necessary to prevent utilities from using their broad state-conferred monopoly power to promote their own economic wellbeing at the expense of the state interest in energy conservation -- an interest that could reasonably be found to be inconsistent with the promotion of greater profits for utilities.</p><p>Indeed, appellee, in its brief, states:</p><p>\"[N]either Central Hudson nor any other party made an attempt before the Commission to demonstrate or argue for a specific advertising strategy that would avoid the difficulties that the Commission found inherent in electric utility promotional advertising.  The Commission, therefore, continued to enforce its ban on promotion which it had instituted in 1973.\"</p><p>Brief for Appellee 15.  The Court makes no attempt to address this statement, or to explain why, when no state body has addressed the issue, the Court should nonetheless resolve it by invalidating the state regulation.</p><p>In making this finding, the Commission distinguished</p><p>\"between promotional advertising designed to shift existing consumption from peak to off-peak hours and advertising designed to promote additional consumption during off-peak hours.\"</p><p>App. to Juris.Statement 58a, n. 2.  It proscribed only the latter.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><p>And in denying appellant's petition for rehearing, the Commission again stated:</p><p>\"While promotion of off-peak usage, particularly electric space heating, is touted by some as desirable because it might increase off-peak usage, and thereby improve a summer-peaking company's load factor, we are convinced that off-peak promotion, especially in the context of imperfectly structured electric rates, is inconsistent with the public interest, even if it could be divorced in the public mind from promoting electric usage generally.  As we pointed out in our Policy Statement, increases in generation, even off-peak generation, at this time, requires the burning of scarce oil resources.  This increased requirement for fuel oil aggravates the nation's already high level of dependence on foreign sources of supply.\"</p><p><em>Id.</em> at 58a (footnotes omitted).</p><p>As previously discussed, however, it does not follow that, because a product is \"energy efficient,\" it is also consistent with the goal of energy conservation.  Thus, with regard to the heat pump, counsel for appellees stated at oral argument that \"Central Hudson says there are some [heat pumps] without air conditioning, but . . . they have never advised us of that.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 333.  The electric heat pump, he continued,</p><p>\"normally carr[ies] with it air conditioning in the summer, and the commission found that this would result in air conditioning that would not otherwise happen.\"</p><p><em>Id.</em> at 33.  This is but one example of the veritable Sargasso Sea of difficult nonlegal issues that we wade into by adopting a rule that requires judges to evaluate highly complex and often controversial questions arising in disciplines quite foreign to ours.</p><p>Even assuming the Court's speculation is correct, it has shown too little.  For the regulation to truly be \"no more extensive than necessary,\" it must be established that a more efficient energy source will serve only as a means for saving energy, rather than as an inducement to consume more energy because the cost has decreased or because other energy using products will be used in conjunction with the more efficient one.</p><p>This characterization is supported by the reasoning of the New York Court of Appeals, which stated:</p><p>\"[P]romotional advertising . . . seeks . . . to encourage the increased consumption of electricity, whether during peak hours or off-peak hours.  Thus, not only does such communication lack any beneficial informative content, hut it may be affirmatively detrimental to the society. . . .  Conserving diminishing resources is a matter of vital State concern, and increased use of electrical energy is inimical to our interests.  Promotional advertising, if permitted, would only serve to exacerbate the crisis.\"</p><p>47 N.Y.2d  at 110, 390 N.E.2d  at 757-758.</p><p>At oral argument, counsel for appellant conceded that the ban would not apply to utility advertising promoting the nonuse of electricity.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.  Indeed, counsel stated:</p><p>\"If the use reduces the amount of electricity used, it is not within the ban.  The promotional ban is defined as anything which might be expected to increase the use of electricity.\"</p><p><em>Ibid.</em>  And counsel for appellee stated that \"the only thing that is involved here is the promotion by advertising of electric usage.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 30.  \"And if a showing can be made that promotion in fact is going to conserve energy,\" counsel for appellee continued,</p><p>\"which . . . has never been made to us, the commission's order says we are ready to relax our ban, we're not interested in banning for the sake of banning it.  We think that is basically a bad idea, if we can avoid it.  In gas, we have been relaxing it as more gas has become available.\"</p><p><em>Id.</em> at 40.</p>"

The order was based on the Commission\\'s finding that \"the interconnected utility system in New York State does not have sufficient fuel stocks or sources of supply to continue furnishing all customer demands for the 1973-1974 winter.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 26a.</p><p>Three years later, when the fuel shortage had eased, the Commission requested comments from the public on its proposal to continue the ban on promotional advertising.  Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp., the appellant in this case, opposed the ban on First Amendment grounds.   App. A10.  After reviewing the public comments, the Commission extended the prohibition in a Policy Statement issued on February 25, 1977.</p><p>The Policy Statement divided advertising expenses</p><p>1 App. to Juris.Statement 35a.  The Commission declared all promotional advertising contrary to the national policy of conserving energy.  It acknowledged that the ban is not a perfect vehicle for conserving energy.  For example, the Commission\\'s order prohibits promotional advertising to develop consumption during periods when demand for electricity is low.  By limiting growth in \"off-peak\" consumption, the ban limits the \"beneficial side effects\" of such growth in terms of more efficient use of existing powerplants.  <em>Id.</em> at 37a.  And since oil dealers are not under the Commission\\'s jurisdiction and </p><p> thus remain free to advertise, it was recognized that the ban can achieve only \"piecemeal conservationism.\"  Still, the Commission adopted the restriction because it was deemed likely to \"result in some dampening of unnecessary growth\" in energy consumption.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><p>The Commission\\'s order explicitly permitted \"informational\" advertising designed to encourage \"<em>shifts</em> of consumption\" from peak demand times to periods of low electricity demand.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original).  Informational advertising would not seek to increase aggregate consumption, but would invite a leveling of demand throughout any given 24-hour period.  The agency offered to review \"specific proposals by the companies for specifically described [advertising] programs that meet these criteria.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 38a.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">II</strong></p><p> dissemination of information.  In applying the First Amendment to this area, we have rejected the \"highly paternalistic\" view that government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech.</p><p>\"[P]eople will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed, and . . . the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication, rather than to close them. . . .\"</p><p>Nevertheless, our decisions have recognized</p><p>\"the \\'common sense\\' distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech.\"</p><p>If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the government\\'s power is more circumscribed.  The State must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech.  Moreover, the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest.  The limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State\\'s goal.  Compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria.  First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved; the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government\\'s purpose.  Second, if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot survive.</p><p>In commercial speech cases, then, a four-part analysis has developed.  At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment.  For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.  Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.  If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">III</strong></p><p>We now apply this four-step analysis for commercial speech to the Commission\\'s arguments in support of its ban on promotional advertising.</p><p><em>A\\r</em></p><p>The Commission does not claim that the expression at issue either is inaccurate or relates to unlawful activity.  Yet the New York Court of Appeals questioned whether Central Hudson\\'s advertising is protected commercial speech.  Because appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area, the state court suggested that the Commission\\'s order restricts no commercial speech of any worth.  The court stated that advertising in a \"noncompetitive market\" </p><p> could not improve the decisionmaking of consumers.  47 N.Y.2d  at 110, 390 N.E.2d  at 757.  The court saw no constitutional problem with barring commercial speech that it viewed as conveying little useful information.</p><p>Even in monopoly markets, the suppression of advertising reduces the information available for consumer decisions, and thereby defeats the purpose of the First Amendment.  The New York court\\'s argument appears to assume that the providers of a monopoly service or product are willing to pay for wholly ineffective advertising.  Most businesses -- even regulated monopolies -- are unlikely to underwrite promotional advertising that is of no interest or use to consumers.  Indeed, a monopoly enterprise legitimately may wish to inform the public that it has developed new services or terms of doing business.  A consumer may need information to aid his decision whether or not to use the monopoly service at all, or how much of the service he should purchase.  In the absence of factors that would distort the decision to advertise, we </p><p><em>B\\r</em></p><p>The Commission offers two state interests as justifications for the ban on promotional advertising.  The first concerns energy conservation.  Any increase in demand for electricity -- during peak or off-peak periods -- means greater consumption of energy.  The Commission argues, and the New York court agreed, that the State\\'s interest in conserving energy is sufficient to support suppression of advertising designed to increase consumption of electricity.  In view of our country\\'s dependence on energy resources beyond our control, no one can doubt the importance of energy conservation.  Plainly, therefore, the state interest asserted is substantial.</p><p>The Commission also argues that promotional advertising will aggravate inequities caused by the failure to base the utilities\\' rates on marginal cost.  The utilities argued to the Commission that, if they could promote the use of electricity in periods of low demand, they would improve their utilization of generating capacity.  The Commission responded that promotion of off-peak consumption also would increase consumption during peak periods.  If peak demand were to rise, the absence of marginal cost rates would mean that the rates charged for the additional power would not reflect the true costs of expanding production.  Instead, the extra costs would </p><p><em>C\\r</em></p><p>Next, we focus on the relationship between the State\\'s interests and the advertising ban.  Under this criterion, the Commission\\'s laudable concern over the equity and efficiency of appellant\\'s rates does not provide a constitutionally adequate reason for restricting protected speech.  The link between the advertising prohibition and appellant\\'s rate structure is, at most, tenuous.  The impact of promotional advertising on the equity of appellant\\'s rates is highly speculative.  Advertising to increase off-peak usage would have to increase peak usage, while other factors that directly affect the fairness and efficiency of appellant\\'s rates remained constant.  Such conditional and remote eventualities simply cannot justify silencing appellant\\'s promotional advertising.</p><p>In contrast, the State\\'s interest in energy conservation is directly advanced by the Commission order at issue here. There is an immediate connection between advertising and demand for electricity.  Central Hudson would not contest the advertising ban unless it believed that promotion would increase its sales.  Thus, we find a direct link between the state interest in conservation and the Commission\\'s order.</p><p><em>D\\r</em></p><p>We come finally to the critical inquiry in this case:  whether the Commission\\'s complete suppression of speech ordinarily protected by the First Amendment is no more extensive than </p><p> necessary to further the State\\'s interest in energy conservation.  The Commission\\'s order reaches all promotional advertising, regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use.  But the energy conservation rationale, as important as it is, cannot justify suppressing information about electric devices or services that would cause no net increase in total energy use.  In addition, no showing has been made that a more limited restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not serve adequately the State\\'s interests.</p><p>Appellant insists that, but for the ban, it would advertise products and services that use energy efficiently.  These include the \"heat pump,\" which both parties acknowledge to be a major improvement in electric heating, and the use of electric heat as a \"backup\" to solar and other heat sources.  Although the Commission has questioned the efficiency of electric heating before this Court, neither the Commission\\'s Policy Statement nor its order denying rehearing made findings on this issue.  In the absence of authoritative findings to the contrary, we must credit as within the realm of possibility the claim that electric heat can be an efficient alternative in some circumstances.</p><p>The Commission also has not demonstrated that its interest in conservation cannot be protected adequately by more limited regulation of appellant\\'s commercial expression.  To further </p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">IV</strong></p><p>Our decision today in no way disparages the national interest in energy conservation.  We accept without reservation the argument that conservation, as well as the development of alternative energy sources, is an imperative national goal.  Administrative bodies empowered to regulate electric utilities have the authority -- and indeed the duty -- to take appropriate action to further this goal.  When, however, such action involves </p><p>Accordingly, the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals is</p><p><em>Reversed.</em></p><p>\"Marginal cost\" has been defined as the \"<em>extra</em> or incremental cost of producing an <em>extra</em> unit of output.\"  P.

This argument was rejected by the New York Court of Appeals, <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm\\'n,</em> 47 N.Y.2d 94, 102-104, 390 N.E.2d 749, 752-754 (1979), and was not argued to this Court.</p><p><em>Consolidated Edison Co. v.

I, of course, agree with the Court that, </p><p> in today\\'s world, energy conservation is a goal of paramount national and local importance.  I disagree with the Court, however, when it says that suppression of speech may be a permissible means to achieve that goal.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS appropriately notes:</p><p>\"The justification for the regulation is nothing more than the expressed fear that the audience may find the utility\\'s message persuasive.  Without the aid of any coercion, deception, or misinformation, truthful communication may persuade some citizens to consume more electricity than they otherwise would.\"</p><p>I seriously doubt whether suppression of information concerning the availability and price of a legally offered product is ever a permissible way for the State to \"dampen\" demand for or use of the product.

We noted that the question of advertising of illegal transactions and the special problems of the electronic broadcast media were not presented.</p><p>Concluding with a restatement of the type of restraint that is not permitted, we said:</p><p>\"What is at issue is whether a State may completely suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that information\\'s effect upon its disseminators and its recipients. . . .

Without the aid of any coercion, deception, or misinformation, truthful communication may persuade some citizens to consume more electricity than they otherwise would.  I assume that such a consequence would be undesirable, and that government may therefore prohibit and punish the unnecessary or excessive use of electricity.  But if the perceived harm associated with greater electrical usage is not sufficiently serious to justify direct regulation, surely it does not constitute the kind of clear and present danger that can justify the suppression of speech. </p><p></p><p>\"But even advocacy of violation, however reprehensible morally, is not a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on.  The wide difference between advocacy and incitement, between preparation and attempt, between assembling and conspiracy, must be borne in mind.

If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.

The blurry line between the two categories of speech has the practical effect of requiring that the utilities either refrain from speech that is close to the line or seek advice from the Public Service Commission.

Secretary of State for Home Affairs ex parte O\\'Brien,</em> [1923] 2 K.B. 361, 382:</p><p>\"\\'You really believe in freedom of speech if you are willing to allow it to men whose opinions seem to you wrong and even dangerous. . . .\\'\"</p><p>',\n",
       " '</p><p></p><p>The Court\\'s analysis, in my view, is wrong in several respects.  Initially, I disagree with the Court\\'s conclusion that the speech of a state-created monopoly, which is the subject of a comprehensive regulatory scheme, is entitled to protection under the First Amendment.  I also think that the Court errs here in failing to recognize that the state law is most accurately viewed as an economic regulation, and that the speech involved (if it falls within the scope of the First Amendment at all) occupies a significantly more subordinate position in the hierarchy of First Amendment values than the Court gives it today.  Finally, the Court, in reaching its decision, improperly substitutes its own judgment for that of the State in deciding how a proper ban on promotional advertising should be drafted.  With regard to this latter point, the Court adopts as its final part of a four-part test a \"no more </p><p> extensive than necessary\" analysis that will unduly impair a state legislature\\'s ability to adopt legislation reasonably designed to promote interests that have always been rightly thought to be of great importance to the State.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">I</strong></p><p>\"A public utility is a state-created monopoly.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law § 68 (McKinney 1955); Jones, Origins of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity; Developments in the States 1870-1920, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 426, 458-461 (1979); Comment, Utility Rates, Consumers, and the New York State Public Service Commission, 39 Albany L.Rev. 707, 709-714 (1975).  Although monopolies generally are against the public policies of the United States and of the State of New York, <em>see, e.g.,</em> N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law § 340 (McKinney 1968 and Supp. 1979-1980), . . . utilities are permitted to operate as monopolies because of a determination by the State that the public interest is better served by protecting them from competition.  <em>See</em> 2 A. Kahn, The Economics of Regulation 11171 (1971).\"</p><p>\"This exceptional grant of power to private enterprises justifies extensive oversight on the part of the State to protect the ratepayers from exploitation of the monopoly power through excessive rates and other forms of overreaching. . . .  New York law gives its Public Service Commission plenary supervisory powers over all property, real and personal, \\'used or to be used for or in connection with or to facilitate the . . . sale or furnishing of electricity for light, heat or power.\\'  N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law §§ 2(12) and 66(1) (McKinney 1955).\"</p><p>Thus, although <em>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, supra,</em> holds that speech of a corporation is entitled to some First Amendment protection, it by no means follows that a utility with monopoly power conferred by a State is also entitled to such protection.</p><p>\"public utility regulation typically </p><p> assumes that the private firm is a natural monopoly, and that public controls are necessary to protect the consumer from exploitation.\"</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">II</strong></p><p>\"Expression concerning purely commercial transactions has come within the ambit of the Amendment\\'s protection </p><p>(Footnote omitted.)</p><p>\"[T]here can be no doubt that upon proper occasion and by appropriate measures the state may regulate a business in any of its aspects. . . . \"</p><p>\"So far as the requirement of due process is concerned, and in the absence of other constitutional restriction, a state is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose.  The courts are without authority either to declare such policy, or, when it is declared by the legislature, to override it.  If the laws passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court <em>functus officio.</em> . . .  [I]t does not lie with the courts to determine that the rule is unwise.\"</p><p>\"The doctrine . . . that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely -- has long since been discarded.  We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.\"</p><p></p><p>An ostensible justification for striking down New York\\'s ban on promotional advertising is that this Court has previously</p><p>\"rejected the \\'highly paternalistic\\' view that government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech.  \\'[P]eople will perceive their own best interests if </p><p> only they are were enough informed and . . . the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication, rather than to close them. . . .\\'\"</p><p>\"Of course, an opportunity for rebuttal seldom suffices to undo [the] harm of a defamatory falsehood.  Indeed, the law of defamation is rooted in our experience that the truth rarely catches up with a lie.\"</p><p> to agree that commercial speech is entitled to some First Amendment protection, I would hold here that the State\\'s decision to ban promotional advertising, in light of the substantial state interest at stake, is a constitutionally permissible exercise of its power to adopt regulations designed to promote the interests of its citizens.</p><p>\"[t]hose who won our independence by revolution were not cowards.  They did not fear political change.  They did not exalt order at the cost of liberty.\"</p><p>\"If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood </p><p> and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.  Only an emergency can justify repression.\"</p><p>Two ideas are here at war with one another, and their resolution, although it be on a judicial battlefield, will be a very difficult one.  The sort of \"advocacy\" of which Mr. Justice Brandeis spoke was not the advocacy on the part of a utility to use more of its product.  Nor do I think those who won our independence, while declining to \"exalt order at the cost of liberty,\" would have viewed a merchant\\'s unfettered freedom to advertise in hawking his wares as a \"liberty\" not subject to extensive regulation in light of the government\\'s substantial interest in attaining \"order\" in the economic sphere.</p><p>\"Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution.  The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to </p><p> such political expression in order \\'to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.\\'\"</p><p>If the complaint of those who feel the Court\\'s opinion does not go far enough is that the \"only test of truth is its ability </p><p>\"Of course I believe that the present ordinance could constitutionally be applied to a \\'merchant\\' who goes from door to door \\'selling pots.\\'\"</p><p>\"This court has unequivocally held that the streets are proper places for the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion, and that, though the states and municipalities may appropriately regulate the privilege in the public interest, they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in these public </p><p> thoroughfares.  <em>We are equally clear that the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising.</em>  Whether, and to what extent, one may promote or pursue a gainful occupation in the streets, to what extent such activity shall be adjudged a derogation of the public right of user, are matters for legislative judgment.\"</p><p>(Emphasis added.)</p><p>The notion that more speech is the remedy to expose falsehood and fallacies is wholly out of place in the commercial bazaar, where. if applied logically. the remedy of one who was defrauded would be merely a statement, available upon request, reciting the Latin maxim \"<em>caveat emptor.</em>\"  But since \"fraudulent speech\" in this area is to be remediable under <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board, supra,</em> the remedy of one defrauded is a lawsuit or an agency proceeding based on common law notions of fraud that are separated by a world of difference </p><p> from the realm of politics and government.  What time, legal decisions, and common sense have so widely severed, I declined to join in <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board,</em> and regret now to see the Court reaping the seeds that it there sowed.  For in a democracy, the economic is subordinate to the political, a lesson that our ancestors learned long ago, and that our descendants will undoubtedly have to relearn many years hence.</p><p><strong class=\"heading-5 font-w-bold\">III</strong></p><p>\"A judge would be unimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a little less \\'drastic\\' or a little less \\'restrictive\\' in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote to strike legislation down.\"</p><p>Here, the Court concludes that the State\\'s interest in energy conservation cannot justify a blanket ban on promotional advertising.  In its statement of the facts, the Court observes that the Commission\\'s ban on promotional advertising is not \"a perfect vehicle for conserving energy.\"  It states:</p><p>\"[T]he Commission\\'s order prohibits promotional advertising to develop consumption during periods when demand for electricity is low.  By limiting growth in \\'off-peak\\' consumption, the ban limits the \\'beneficial side effects\\' of such growth in terms of more efficient use of existing powerplants.  [App. to Juris.Statement] 37a.\"</p><p>\"Increased off-peak generation, . . . while conferring </p><p> some beneficial side effects, also consumes valuable energy resources and, if it is the result of increased sales, necessarily creates incremental air pollution and thermal discharges to waterways.  More important, any increase in off-peak generation from most of the major companies producing electricity in this State would not, at this time, be produced from coal or nuclear resources, but would require the use of oil-fired generating facilities.  The increased requirement for fuel oil to serve the incremental off-peak load created by promotional advertising would aggravate the nation\\'s already unacceptably high level of dependence on foreign sources of supply, and would, in addition, frustrate, rather than encourage, conservation efforts.\"</p><p>The Court also observes, as the Commission acknowledged, that the ban on promotional advertising can achieve only \"piecemeal conservationism,\" because oil dealers are not under the Commission\\'s jurisdiction, and they remain free to advertise.  Until I have mastered electrical engineering and marketing, I am not prepared to contradict by virtue of my judicial office those who assume that the ban will be successful in making a substantial contribution to conservation efforts.  </p><p> And I doubt that any of this Court\\'s First Amendment decisions justify striking down the Commission\\'s order because more steps toward conservation could have been made.  This is especially true when, as here, the Commission lacks authority over oil dealers.</p><p>\"[I]nstallation of a heat pump means also installation of central air-conditioning.  To this extent, promotion of off-peak electric space heating involves promotion of on-peak summer air-conditioning, as well as on-peak usage </p><p> of electricity for water heating.  And the price of electricity to most consumers in the State does not now fully reflect the much higher marginal costs of on-peak consumption in summer peaking markets.  In these circumstances, there would be a subsidization of consumption on-peak, and consequently, higher rates for all consumers.\"</p><p>App. to Juris.Statement 58a.  Subsidization of peak consumption not only may encourage the use of scarce energy resources during peak periods, but also may lead to larger reserve generating capacity requirements for the State.</p><p>\"[i]n the absence of authoritative findings to the contrary, we must credit as within the realm of possibility the claim that electric heat can be an efficient alternative in some circumstances.\"</p><p>Ordinarily it is the role of the State Public Service Commission to make factual determinations concerning whether a device or service will result in a net energy savings and, if so, whether and to what extent state law permits dissemination of information about the device or service.  Otherwise, </p><p>It is, in my view, inappropriate for the Court to invalidate the State\\'s ban on commercial advertising here, based on its speculation that, in some cases, the advertising may result in a net savings in electrical energy use, and in the cases in which it is clear a net energy savings would result from utility advertising, the Public Service Commission would apply its </p><p>This is clearly the case here.</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals.</p><p>The New York Court of Appeals stated:</p><p>\"In light of current exigencies, one of the policies of any public service legislation must be the conservation of our vital and irreplaceable resources.  The Legislature has but recently imposed upon the commission a duty\"</p><p>\"to encourage all persons and corporations . . . to formulate and carry out long-range programs . . . [for] the preservation of environmental values and the conservation of natural resources.\"</p><p><em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm\\'n,</em> 47 N.Y.2d 94, 102-103, 390 N.E.2d 749, 753 (1979).</p><p>In this regard, the New York Court of Appeals stated:</p><p>\"Public utilities, from the earliest days in this State, have been regulated and franchised to serve the commonweal.  Our policy is\"</p><p>\"to withdraw the unrestricted right of competition between corporations occupying . . . the public streets . . . and supplying the public with their products or utilities which are well nigh necessities\"</p><p>\"(<em>People ex rel. New York Edison Co. v. Willcox,</em> 207 N.Y. 86, 99; <em>Matter of New York Elec. Lines Co.,</em> 201 N.Y. 321).  The realities of the situation all but dictate that a utility be granted monopoly status (<em>see People ex rel. New York Elec. Lines Co. v. Squire,</em> 107 N.Y. 593, 603-605).  To protect against abuse of this superior economic position, extensive governmental regulation has been deemed a necessary coordinate (<em>see People ex rel. New York Edison Co. v. Willcox, supra</em> at pp. 93-94).\"</p><p>47 N.Y.2d  at 109-110, 390 N.E.2d  at 757.</p><p>The Commission\\'s restrictions on promotional advertising are grounded in its concern that electric utilities fulfill their obligation under the New York Public Service Law to provide \"adequate\" service at \"just and reasonable\" rates.  N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law § 65(1) (McKinney 1955).  The Commission, under state law, is required to set reasonable rates.  N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law §§ 66(2) and 72 (McKinney 1955); § 66 (12) (McKinney Supp. 1979).  The Commission has also been authorized by the legislature to prescribe \"such reasonable improvements [in electric utilities\\' practices] as will best promote the public interest. . . .\" § 66(2).  And in the performance of its duties, the Commission is required to</p><p>\"encourage all persons and corporations subject to its jurisdiction to formulate and carry out long-range programs, individually or cooperatively, for the performance of their public service responsibilities with economy, efficiency, and care for the public safety, the preservation of environmental values, and the conservation of natural resources.\"</p><p>N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law § 5(2) (McKinney Supp. 1979).  Here, I think it was quite reasonable for the State Public Service Commission to conclude that the ban on promotional advertising was necessary to prevent utilities from using their broad state-conferred monopoly power to promote their own economic wellbeing at the expense of the state interest in energy conservation -- an interest that could reasonably be found to be inconsistent with the promotion of greater profits for utilities.</p><p>Indeed, appellee, in its brief, states:</p><p>\"[N]either Central Hudson nor any other party made an attempt before the Commission to demonstrate or argue for a specific advertising strategy that would avoid the difficulties that the Commission found inherent in electric utility promotional advertising.  The Commission, therefore, continued to enforce its ban on promotion which it had instituted in 1973.\"</p><p>Brief for Appellee 15.  The Court makes no attempt to address this statement, or to explain why, when no state body has addressed the issue, the Court should nonetheless resolve it by invalidating the state regulation.</p><p>In making this finding, the Commission distinguished</p><p>\"between promotional advertising designed to shift existing consumption from peak to off-peak hours and advertising designed to promote additional consumption during off-peak hours.\"</p><p>App. to Juris.Statement 58a, n. 2.  It proscribed only the latter.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><p>And in denying appellant\\'s petition for rehearing, the Commission again stated:</p><p>\"While promotion of off-peak usage, particularly electric space heating, is touted by some as desirable because it might increase off-peak usage, and thereby improve a summer-peaking company\\'s load factor, we are convinced that off-peak promotion, especially in the context of imperfectly structured electric rates, is inconsistent with the public interest, even if it could be divorced in the public mind from promoting electric usage generally.  As we pointed out in our Policy Statement, increases in generation, even off-peak generation, at this time, requires the burning of scarce oil resources.  This increased requirement for fuel oil aggravates the nation\\'s already high level of dependence on foreign sources of supply.\"</p><p><em>Id.</em> at 58a (footnotes omitted).</p><p>As previously discussed, however, it does not follow that, because a product is \"energy efficient,\" it is also consistent with the goal of energy conservation.  Thus, with regard to the heat pump, counsel for appellees stated at oral argument that \"Central Hudson says there are some [heat pumps] without air conditioning, but . . . they have never advised us of that.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 333.  The electric heat pump, he continued,</p><p>\"normally carr[ies] with it air conditioning in the summer, and the commission found that this would result in air conditioning that would not otherwise happen.\"</p><p><em>Id.</em> at 33.  This is but one example of the veritable Sargasso Sea of difficult nonlegal issues that we wade into by adopting a rule that requires judges to evaluate highly complex and often controversial questions arising in disciplines quite foreign to ours.</p><p>Even assuming the Court\\'s speculation is correct, it has shown too little.  For the regulation to truly be \"no more extensive than necessary,\" it must be established that a more efficient energy source will serve only as a means for saving energy, rather than as an inducement to consume more energy because the cost has decreased or because other energy using products will be used in conjunction with the more efficient one.</p><p>This characterization is supported by the reasoning of the New York Court of Appeals, which stated:</p><p>\"[P]romotional advertising . . . seeks . . . to encourage the increased consumption of electricity, whether during peak hours or off-peak hours.  Thus, not only does such communication lack any beneficial informative content, hut it may be affirmatively detrimental to the society. . . .  Conserving diminishing resources is a matter of vital State concern, and increased use of electrical energy is inimical to our interests.  Promotional advertising, if permitted, would only serve to exacerbate the crisis.\"</p><p>47 N.Y.2d  at 110, 390 N.E.2d  at 757-758.</p><p>At oral argument, counsel for appellant conceded that the ban would not apply to utility advertising promoting the nonuse of electricity.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.  Indeed, counsel stated:</p><p>\"If the use reduces the amount of electricity used, it is not within the ban.  The promotional ban is defined as anything which might be expected to increase the use of electricity.\"</p><p><em>Ibid.</em>  And counsel for appellee stated that \"the only thing that is involved here is the promotion by advertising of electric usage.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 30.  \"And if a showing can be made that promotion in fact is going to conserve energy,\" counsel for appellee continued,</p><p>\"which . . . has never been made to us, the commission\\'s order says we are ready to relax our ban, we\\'re not interested in banning for the sake of banning it.  We think that is basically a bad idea, if we can avoid it.  In gas, we have been relaxing it as more gas has become available.\"</p><p><em>Id.</em> at 40.</p>']"

Perhaps subjects such as mathematics, physics or chemistry are, or can be, completely secularized.  But it would not seem practical to teach either practice or appreciation of the arts if we are to forbid exposure of youth to any religious influences.  Music without sacred music, architecture minus the cathedral, or painting without the scriptural themes would be eccentric and incomplete, even from a secular point of view. . . .  I should suppose it is a proper, if not an indispensable, part of preparation for a worldly life to know the roles that religion and religions have played in the tragic story of mankind.  The fact is that, for good or for ill, nearly everything in our culture worth transmitting, everything which gives meaning to life, is saturated with religious influences, derived from paganism, Judaism, Christianity -- both Catholic and Protestant -- and other faiths accepted by a large part of the world\\'s peoples.  One can hardly respect the system of education that would leave the student wholly ignorant of the currents of religious thought that move the world society for a part in which he is being prepared. \"</p><p>I therefore dissent from what I cannot refrain from describing as a cavalier summary reversal, without benefit of oral argument or briefs on the merits, of the highest court of Kentucky.</p><p>The Court\\'s emphasis on the religious nature of the first part of the Ten Commandments is beside the point.  The document as a whole has had significant secular impact, and the Constitution does not require that Kentucky students see only an expurgated or redacted version containing only the elements with directly traceable secular effects.</p>'"

The Council refused a place in the 1993 event to respondent GLIB, an organization formed for the purpose of marching in the parade in order to express its members\\' pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to show that there are such individuals in the community, and to support the like men and women who sought to march in the New York St. Patrick\\'s Day parade. GLIB and some of its members filed this suit in state court, alleging that the denial of their application to march violated, <em>inter alia, </em>a state law prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. In finding such a violation and ordering the Council to include GLIB in the parade, the trial court, among other things, concluded that the parade had no common theme other than the involvement of the participants, and that, given the Council\\'s lack of selectivity in choosing parade participants and its failure to circumscribe the marchers\\' messages, the parade lacked any expressive purpose, such that GLIB\\'s inclusion therein would not violate the Council\\'s First Amendment rights.

Washington himself reportedly drew on the earlier tradition in choosing \"St. Patrick\" as the response to \"Boston,\" the password used in the colonial lines on evacuation day. See J. Crimmins, St. Patrick\\'s Day: Its Celebration in New York and other American Places, 1737-1845, pp. 15, 19 (1902); see generally 1 H. Commager &amp; R. Morris, The Spirit of \\'Seventy Six, pp. 138-183 (1958); The American Book of Days 262-265 (J. Hatch ed., 3d ed. 1978). Although the General Court of Massachusetts did not officially designate March 17 as Evacuation Day until 1938, see Mass. Gen. Laws § 6:12K (1992), the City Council of Boston had previously sponsored public celebrations of Evacuation Day, including notable commemorations on the centennial in 1876, and on the 125th anniversary in 1901, with its parade, salute, concert, and fireworks display. See Celebration of the Centennial Anniversary of the Evacuation of Boston by the British Army (G. Ellis ed. <em>1876); Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston </em>v. <em>City of Boston et al., </em>Civ. Action No. 92-1518A (Super. Ct., Mass., Dec. 15, 1993), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. B1, B8-B9.</p><p>The tradition of formal sponsorship by the city came to an end in 1947, however, when Mayor James Michael Curley himself granted authority to organize and conduct the St. Patrick\\'s Day-Evacuation Day Parade to the petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated association of individuals elected from various South Boston veterans groups. Every year since that time, the Council has applied for and received a permit for the parade, which at times has included as many as 20,000 marchers and drawn</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>up to 1 million watchers. No other applicant has ever applied for that permit. <em>Id., </em>at B9. Through 1992, the city allowed the Council to use the city\\'s official seal, and provided printing services as well as direct funding.</p><p>In 1992, a number of gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the Irish immigrants joined together with other supporters to form the respondent organization, GLIB, to march in the parade as a way to express pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to demonstrate that there are such men and women among those so descended, and to express their solidarity with like individuals who sought to march in New York\\'s St. Patrick\\'s Day Parade. <em>Id., </em>at B3; App. 51. Although the Council denied GLIB\\'s application to take part in the 1992 parade, GLIB obtained a state-court order to include its contingent, which marched \"uneventfully\" among that year\\'s 10,000 participants and 750,000 spectators. App. to Pet. for Cert. B3, and n. 4.</p><p>In 1993, after the Council had again refused to admit GLIB to the upcoming parade, the organization and some of its members filed this suit against the Council, the individual petitioner John J. \"Wacko\" Hurley, and the city of Boston, alleging violations of the State and Federal Constitutions and of the state public accommodations law, which prohibits \"any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of ... sexual orientation ... relative to the admission of any person to, or treatment in any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement.\" Mass. Gen. Laws § 272:98 (1992). After finding that \"[f]or at least the past 47 years, the Parade has traveled the same basic route along the public streets of South Boston, providing entertainment, amusement, and recreation to participants and spectators alike,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. B5-B6, the state trial court ruled that the parade fell within the statutory definition of a public accommodation, which includes \"any place ... which is open to and accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>and, without limiting the generality of this definition, whether or not it be ... (6) a boardwalk or other public highway [or] ... (8) a place of public amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment,\" Mass. Gen. Laws § 272:92A (1992). The court found that the Council had no written criteria and employed no particular procedures for admission, voted on new applications in batches, had occasionally admitted groups who simply showed up at the parade without having submitted an application, and did \"not generally inquire into the specific messages or views of each applicant.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. B8-B9. The court consequently rejected the Council\\'s contention that the parade was \"private\" (in the sense of being exclusive), holding instead that \"the lack of genuine selectivity in choosing participants and sponsors demonstrates that the Parade is a public event.\" <em>Id., </em>at B6. It found the parade to be \"eclectic,\" containing a wide variety of \"patriotic, commercial, political, moral, artistic, religious, athletic, public service, trade union, and eleemosynary themes,\" as well as conflicting messages. <em>Id., </em>at B24. While noting that the Council had indeed excluded the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR (an antibusing group), id., at B7, it attributed little significance to these facts, concluding ultimately that \"[t]he only common theme among the participants and sponsors is their public involvement in the Parade,\" id., at B24.</p><p>The court rejected the Council\\'s assertion that the exclusion of \"groups with sexual themes merely formalized [the fact] that the Parade expresses traditional religious and social values,\" id., at B3, and found the Council\\'s \"final position [to be] that GLIB would be excluded because of its values and its message, i. <em>e., </em>its members\\' sexual orientation,\" id., at B4, n. 5, citing Tr. of Closing Arg. 43, 51-52 (Nov. 23, 1993). This position, in the court\\'s view, was not only violative of the public accommodations law but \"paradoxical\" as well, since \"a proper celebration of St. Patrick\\'s and Evacuation Day requires diversity and inclusiveness.\" App. to Pet. for</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>Cert. B24. The court rejected the notion that GLIB\\'s admission would trample on the Council\\'s First Amendment rights since the court understood that constitutional protection of any interest in expressive association would \"requir[e] focus on a specific message, theme, or group\" absent from the parade. <em>Ibid. </em>\"Given the [Council\\'s] lack of selectivity in choosing participants and failure to circumscribe the marchers\\' message,\" the court found it \"impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade to protection under the First Amendment.\" <em>Id., </em>at B25. It concluded that the parade is \"not an exercise of [the Council\\'s] constitutionally protected right of expressive association,\" but instead \"an open recreational event that is subject to the public accommodations law.\" <em>Id., </em>at B27.</p><p>The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed, seeing nothing clearly erroneous in the trial judge\\'s findings</p><p>1 The court dismissed the public accommodations law claim against the city because it found that the city\\'s actions did not amount to inciting or assisting in the Council\\'s violations of § 272:98. App. to Pet. for Cert. B12-B13. It also dismissed respondents\\' First and Fourteenth Amendment challenge against the Council for want of state action triggering the proscriptions of those Amendments. <em>Id., </em>at B14-B22. Finally, the court did not reach the state constitutional questions, since respondents had apparently assumed in their arguments that those claims, too, depended for their success upon a finding of state action and because of the court\\'s holding that the public accommodation statutes apply to the parade. <em>Id., </em>at B22.</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>that GLIB was excluded from the parade based on the sexual orientation of its members, that it was impossible to detect an expressive purpose in the parade, that there was no state action, and that the parade was a public accommodation within the meaning of § 272:92A. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>418 Mass. 238,242-248,636 N. E. 2d 1293, 1295-1298 (1994).2 Turning to petitioners\\' First Amendment claim that application of the public accommodations law to the parade violated their freedom of speech (as distinguished from their right to expressive association, raised in the trial court), the court\\'s majority held that it need not decide on the particular First Amendment theory involved \"because, as the [trial] judge found, it is \\'impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade to protection under the First Amendment.\\'\" <em>Id., </em>at 249, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1299 (footnote omitted). The defendants had thus failed at the trial level \"to demonstrate that the parade truly was an exercise of ... First Amendment rights,\" id., at 250, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1299, citing <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 </em>U. S. 288, 293, n. 5 (1984), and on appeal nothing indicated to the majority of the Supreme Judicial Court that the trial judge\\'s assessment of the evidence on this point was clearly erroneous, 418 Mass., at 250, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1299. The court rejected petitioners\\' further challenge to the law as overbroad, holding that it does not, on its face, regulate speech, does not let public officials examine the content of speech, and would not be interpreted as reaching speech. <em>Id., </em>at 251-252, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1300. Finally, the court rejected the challenge that the public accommodations law was unconstitutionally vague, holding that this case did not present an issue of speech and that the law gave persons of</p><p>2 Since respondents did not cross-appeal the dismissal of their claims against the city, the Supreme Judicial Court declined to reach those claims. 418 Mass., at 245, n. 12, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1297.</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited. <em>Id., </em>at 252,636 N. E. 2d, at 1300-130l.</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>N. E. 2d, at 1304. The dissent accordingly concluded that the Council had not even violated the State\\'s public accommodations law.</p><p>We granted certiorari to determine whether the requirement to admit a parade contingent expressing a message not of the private organizers\\' own choosing violates the First Amendment. 513 U. S. 1071 (1995). We hold that it does and reverse.</p><p align=\"center\">\\nII</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p align=\"center\">\\nIII A</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>Not many marches, then, are beyond the realm of expressive parades, and the South Boston celebration is not one of them. Spectators line the streets; people march in costumes and uniforms, carrying flags and banners with all sorts of messages (e. g., \"England get out of Ireland,\" \"Say no to drugs\"); marching bands and pipers play; floats are pulled along; and the whole show is broadcast over Boston television. See Record, Exh. 84 (video). To be sure, we agree with the state courts that in spite of excluding some applicants, the Council is rather lenient in admitting participants. But a private speaker does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices, or by failing to edit their themes to isolate an exact message as the exclusive</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>Respondents\\' participation as a unit in the parade was equally expressive. GLIB was formed for the very purpose of marching in it, as the trial court found, in order to celebrate its members\\' identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the Irish immigrants, to show that there are such individuals in the community, and to support the like men and women who sought to march in the New York parade. App. to Pet. for Cert. B3. The organization distributed a fact sheet describing the members\\' intentions, App. A51, and the record otherwise corroborates the expressive nature of GLIB\\'s participation, see Record, Exh. 84 (video); App. A67 (photograph). In 1993, members of GLIB marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner with the simple inscription \"Irish American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston.\" GLIB understandably seeks to communicate its ideas as part of the existing parade, rather than staging one of its own.</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>B</p><p>After the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was the first State to codify this principle to ensure access to public accommodations regardless of race. See Act Forbidding Unjust Discrimination on Account of Color or Race, 1865 Mass. Acts, ch. 277 (May 16, 1865); Konvitz &amp; Leskes, <em>supra, </em>at 155-156; Lerman &amp; Sanderson, Discrimination in Access to Public Places: A Survey of State and Federal Public Accommodations Laws, 7 N. Y. U. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Change 215, 238 (1978); Fox, Discrimination and Antidiscrimination in Massachusetts Law, 44 B. U. L. Rev. 30, 58 (1964). In prohibiting discrimination \"in any licensed inn, in any public place of amusement, public conveyance or public meeting,\" 1865 Mass. Acts, ch. 277, § 1, the original statute already expanded upon the common law, which had not conferred any right of access to places of public amusement, Lerman &amp; Sanderson, <em>supra, </em>at 248. As with many public accommodations statutes across the Nation, the legislature continued to</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p align=\"center\">\\nC</p><p>In the case before us, however, the Massachusetts law has been applied in a peculiar way. Its enforcement does not address any dispute about the participation of openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals in various units admitted to the parade. Petitioners disclaim any intent to exclude homosexuals as such, and no individual member of GLIB claims to have been excluded from parading as a member of any group that the Council has approved to march. Instead, the disagreement goes to the admission of GLIB as its own parade unit carrying its own banner. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B26-B27, and n. 28. Since every participating unit affects the message conveyed by the private organizers, the state courts\\' application of the statute produced an order essentially requiring petitioners to alter the expressive content</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>of their parade. Although the state courts spoke of the parade as a place of public accommodation, see, <em>e. </em>g., 418 Mass., at 247-248, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1297-1298, once the expressive character of both the parade and the marching GLIB contingent is understood, it becomes apparent that the state courts\\' application of the statute had the effect of declaring the sponsors\\' speech itself to be the public accommodation. Under this approach any contingent of protected individuals with a message would have the right to participate in petitioners\\' speech, so that the communication produced by the private organizers would be shaped by all those protected by the law who wished to join in with some expressive demonstration of their own. But this use of the State\\'s power violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>Petitioners\\' claim to the benefit of this principle of autonomy to control one\\'s own speech is as sound as the South Boston parade is expressive. Rather like a composer, the Council selects the expressive units of the parade from potential participants, and though the score may not produce a particularized message, each contingent\\'s expression in the Council\\'s eyes comports with what merits celebration on that day. Even if this view gives the Council credit for a more considered judgment than it actively made, the Council clearly decided to exclude a message it did not like from the communication it chose to make, and that is enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to shape its expression by speaking on one subject while remaining silent on another. The message it disfavored is not difficult to identify. Although GLIB\\'s point (like the Council\\'s) is not wholly articulate, a contingent marching behind the organization\\'s banner would at least bear witness to the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the presence of the organized marchers would suggest their view that people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified social acceptance as heterosexuals and indeed as members of parade units organized around other identifying characteristics. The parade\\'s organizers may not believe these facts about Irish sexuality to be so, or they may object to unqualified</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>social acceptance of gays and lesbians or have some other reason for wishing to keep GLIB\\'s message out of the parade. But whatever the reason, it boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound a particular point of view, and that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government\\'s power to control.</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>[were] freely able to compel ... speakers to propound political messages with which they disagree, ... protection [of a speaker\\'s freedom] would be empty, for the government could require speakers to affirm in one breath that which they deny in the next.\" <em>Id., </em>at 16. Thus, when dissemination of a view contrary to one\\'s own is forced upon a speaker intimately connected with the communication advanced, the speaker\\'s right to autonomy over the message is compromised.</p><p>In <em>Turner Broadcasting, </em>we found this problem absent in the cable context, because \"[g]iven cable\\'s long history of serving as a conduit for broadcast signals, there appears little risk that cable viewers would assume that the broadcast stations carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages endorsed by the cable operator.\" 512 U. S., at 655. We stressed that the viewer is frequently apprised of the identity of the broadcaster whose signal is being received via cable and that it is \"common practice for broadcasters to disclaim any identity of viewpoint between the management and the speakers who use the broadcast facility.\" <em>Ibid. </em>(citation omitted); see id., at 684 (O\\'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that Congress \"might ... conceivably obligate cable operators to act as common carriers for some of their channels\").</p><p>Parades and demonstrations, in contrast, are not understood to be so neutrally presented or selectively viewed. Unlike the programming offered on various channels by a cable network, the parade does not consist of individual, unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted together for individual selection by members of the audience. Although each parade unit generally identifies itself, each is understood to contribute something to a common theme, and accordingly there is no customary practice whereby private sponsors disavow \"any identity of viewpoint\" between themselves and the selected participants. Practice follows practicability here, for such disclaimers would be quite curious in a moving</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>In this case, of course, there is no assertion comparable to the <em>Turner Broadcasting </em>claim that some speakers will be destroyed in the absence of the challenged law. True, the size and success of petitioners\\' parade makes it an enviable vehicle for the dissemination of GLIB\\'s views, but that fact,</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>without more, would fall far short of supporting a claim that petitioners enjoy an abiding monopoly of access to spectators. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B9; Brief for Respondents 10 (citing trial court\\'s finding that no other applicant has applied for the permit). Considering that GLIB presumably would have had a fair shot (under neutral criteria developed by the city) at obtaining a parade permit of its own, respondents have not shown that petitioners enjoy the capacity to \"silence the voice of competing speakers,\" as cable operators do with respect to program providers who wish to reach subscribers, <em>Turner Broadcasting, supra, </em>at 656. Nor has any other legitimate interest been identified in support of applying the Massachusetts statute in this way to expressive activity like the parade.</p><p>The statute, Mass. Gen. Laws § 272:98 (1992), is a piece of protective legislation that announces no purpose beyond the object both expressed and apparent in its provisions, which is to prevent any denial of access to (or discriminatory treatment in) public accommodations on proscribed grounds, including sexual orientation. On its face, the object of the law is to ensure by statute for gays and lesbians desiring to make use of public accommodations what the old common law promised to any member of the public wanting a meal at the inn, that accepting the usual terms of service, they will not be turned away merely on the proprietor\\'s exercise of personal preference. When the law is applied to expressive activity in the way it was done here, its apparent object is simply to require speakers to modify the content of their expression to whatever extent beneficiaries of the law choose to alter it with messages of their own. But in the absence of some further, legitimate end, this object is merely to allow exactly what the general rule of speaker\\'s autonomy forbids.</p><p>It might, of course, have been argued that a broader objective is apparent: that the ultimate point of forbidding acts of discrimination toward certain classes is to produce a society free of the corresponding biases. Requiring access to a</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>Far from supporting GLIB, then, <em>Turner Broadcasting </em>points to the reasons why the present application of the Massachusetts law can not be sustained. So do the two other principal authorities GLIB has cited. In <em>PruneYard Shopping Center </em>v. <em>Robins, supra, </em>to be sure, we</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>sustained a state law requiring the proprietors of shopping malls to allow visitors to solicit signatures on political petitions without a showing that the shopping mall owners would otherwise prevent the beneficiaries of the law from reaching an audience. But we found in that case that the proprietors were running \"a business establishment that is open to the public to come and go as they please,\" that the solicitations would \"not likely be identified with those of the owner,\" and that the proprietors could \"expressly disavow any connection with the message by simply posting signs in the area where the speakers or handbillers stand.\" 447 U. S., at 87. Also, in <em>Pacific Gas </em>&amp; <em>Electric, supra, </em>at 12, we noted that <em>PruneYard </em>did not involve \"any concern that access to this area might affect the shopping center owner\\'s exercise of his own right to speak: the owner did not even allege that he objected to the content of the pamphlets .... \" The principle of speaker\\'s autonomy was simply not threatened in that case.</p><p><em>New York State Club Assn. </em>is also instructive by the contrast it provides. There, we turned back a facial challenge to a state antidiscrimination statute on the assumption that the expressive associational character of a dining club with over 400 members could be sufficiently attenuated to permit application of the law even to such a private organization, but we also recognized that the State did not prohibit exclusion of those whose views were at odds with positions espoused by the general club memberships. 487 U. S., at 13; see also <em>Roberts, </em>468 U. S., at 627. In other words, although the association provided public benefits to which a State could ensure equal access, it was also engaged in expressive activity; compelled access to the benefit, which was upheld, did not trespass on the organization\\'s message itself. If we were to analyze this case strictly along those lines, GLIB would lose. Assuming the parade to be large enough and a source of benefits (apart from its expression) that would generally justify a mandated access provision, GLIB could</p><p style=\"page-break-after:always\"></p><p>nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contingent with its own message just as readily as a private club could exclude an applicant whose manifest views were at odds with a position taken by the club\\'s existing members.</p><p align=\"center\">\\nIV</p><p>Our holding today rests not on any particular view about the Council\\'s message but on the Nation\\'s commitment to protect freedom of speech. Disapproval of a private speaker\\'s statement does not legitimize use of the Commonwealth\\'s power to compel the speaker to alter the message by including one more acceptable to others. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p>'"
