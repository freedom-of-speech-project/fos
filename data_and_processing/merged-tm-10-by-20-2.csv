 STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   In an action for a libel, it is not indispensable to use the word ""maliciously"" in the declaration.  It is sufficient if words of equivalent power or import are used. Every publication, either by writing, printing, or pictures, which charges upon or imputes to any person that which renders him liable to punishment or which is calculated to make him infamous or odious or ridiculous is  prima facie  a libel, and implies malice in the author and publisher towards the person concerning whom such publication is made. Proof of malice cannot, in these cases, be required of the party complaining   beyond the proof of the publication itself; justification, excuse, or extenuation, if either can be shown, must proceed from the defendant. Privileged communications are an exception, and the rule of evidence as to such cases is so far changed as to require of the plaintiff to bring home to the defendant the existence of malice as the true motive of his conduct.  Privileged communications are of four kinds: 1. Wherever the author and publisher of the alleged slander acted in the  bona fide  discharge of a public or private duty, legal or moral, or in the prosecution of his own rights or interests. 2. Anything said or written by a master in giving the character of a servant who has been in his employment. 3. Words used in the course of a legal or judicial proceeding, however hard they may bear upon the party of whom they are used. 4. Publications duly made in the ordinary mode of Parliamentary proceedings, as a petition printed and delivered to the members of a committee appointed by the House of Commons to hear and examine grievances. But in these cases, the only effect of the change of the rule is to remove the usual presumption of malice.  It then becomes incumbent on the party complaining to show malice either by the construction of the spoken or written matter or by facts and circumstances connected with that matter, or with the situation of the parties, adequate to authorize the conclusion. Proof of express malice, so given, will render the publication, petition, or proceeding, libelous.  Falsehood and the absence of probable cause will amount to proof of malice. The jury being the tribunal to determine whether this malice did or did not mark the publication, the alleged libel should be submitted to them, and the court below erred in withholding it. The facts were these: On 26 June, 1841, the following letter was addressed to the President of the United States: ""Georgetown, June 26, 1841"" ""SIR:  We feel it to be proper to put you in possession of the grounds upon which the removal of Mr. Robert White from the office of collector of customs of this port is requested.  You will recollect the humiliating and prostrate condition of the people of this district about a year ago, when the majority then in Congress determined to destroy our banks as a punishment upon us for having avowed and published our preference for the candidates of the great whig party.  It was in that dark season that Mr. White determined to desert his own fellow citizens and to join in the war which was making upon their liberties and interests.  Being then seeking office, he thought to recommend himself to the executive by getting up a memorial here, which was to be used as a sanction or approval, on the part of our own citizens, of the mad policy which had been adopted by their oppressors.  He then joined with an assemblage of forty-eight persons in getting up a memorial which none but themselves could be induced to sign.  These memorialists, with about five exceptions, could not be identified by name or residence   as citizens of Georgetown.  Upon investigation, they proved to be apprentices and journeymen holding a transient residence in the town.  Being few in number, they were no doubt believed by Congress and persons at a distance to be a select body of experienced merchants and traders who had some knowledge of the subject of their memorial.  A copy of the memorial has been deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury."" ""It is perhaps one of the vilest calumnies ever issued by a band of thoughtless and irresponsible individuals, many of whom would have shrunk from such a proceeding had they the necessary intelligence to comprehend its enormity.  But not so with Mr. White.  He knew the paper contained an unmitigated slander.  He seemed to be willing to blacken the character of those of his fellow citizens who had been entrusted with the charge of our banks if that would only secure an appointment when all other methods had failed him for the preceding twelve years."" ""We revolt at the idea of Mr. White's being permitted to remain in an office whose emoluments flow from the labor and enterprise of the very men whose business and families he sought to involve in ruin."" ""It is impossible that he can ever regain the confidence of men whom he abandoned and vilified in the darkest hour of their existence.  His expulsion from office is no less demanded by his unpardonable conduct than by justice to the wounded feelings of an injured community."" ""About the same time, June, 1840, with the persons under his influence, and as is believed at the request of an officeholder of great political rancor, Mr. White procured Dr. Duncan, then a member of Congress from Ohio, to deliver a speech here in abuse of General Harrison.  The speech was perhaps the very vilest that was ever delivered by that gentleman."" ""It was so satisfactory to Mr. White, who acted as vice-president on the occasion, that he immediately rose and moved the doctor a vote of thanks, and a request that the speech be furnished for publication.  The resolutions which were adopted unanimously on the occasion, were nearly as calumnious as the speech itself."" ""We refer you to the Globe newspaper of 3 July last for an official account of the proceedings of the meeting.  We will only trouble you with a few sentences, that you may have some idea of the character of those extraordinary proceedings.  They denounced General Harrison as 'the nominee of the bank whig Federalist, abolitionist and anti-masons,' 'an abolitionist of fraud and concealment,' as being guilty of pursuing a course 'grossly insulting to common sense, honesty, and decency, by shrouding himself in darkness,' 'of courting dangerous fanatics, and countenancing them [abolitionists] in their mad warfare upon our peace, our property,   and our lives,' and 'that he should be treated as an abolitionist.'"" ""Mr. White's was the place where the leading men of his party nightly assembled up to the close of the presidential election, and a respectable citizen declares, that since Mr. White's appointment he circulated 'bushels' of the 'Globe.'  He declines to give his formal evidence in the case upon the ground that he being a near neighbor of Mr. W., he is unwilling to disturb the friendly personal relations existing between them."" ""Such was Mr. White's general political violence, and the unhesitancy with which he descended to the lowest means to secure the favor of the late administration, that no one doubted here but that he would be dismissed when the present party came into power, and no one can be more astonished than Mr. White is himself at his retention to the present time."" ""We will also take this opportunity to state, that we desire Mr. H. Addison to be appointed to the office of collector in Mr. White's place, whose abundant testimonials and recommendations of our business citizens are already on file with the Secretary of the Treasury."" ""With great respect, your obedient servants,"" ""CHAS. C. FULTON"" ""E. M. LINTHICUM"" ""RAP. SEMMES"" ""O. M. LINTHICUM"" ""WM. ROBINSON"" ""WM. S. NICHOLLS"" ""PAUL STEVENS"" ""P.S.  It is further proper to state, that Mr. Addison's recommendations, filed with Mr. Ewing, are signed by every citizen in town, with a single exception, who have regular business to transact at the custom house."" On some other day, which was not stated in the record, the following letter was addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury. ""HON. THOMAS EWING"" "" Secretary of the Treasury "" ""SIR -- Earnestly requesting, as we now do, the immediate removal of Mr. Robt. White from the office of collector of this port, we feel it proper to state candidly our insuperable objections to his continuance in that office."" ""At a time when a remorseless and vindictive majority in Congress were making a ruinous war upon all the business interests of the country, by destroying confidence in its banking institutions, and when that majority were pursuing a most persecuting and ruinous course towards the defenseless and unoffending people of this district, Mr. White, for the mere purpose of evidencing his unscrupulous   zeal in behalf of the late administration, and to secure its favor, did, under the most offensive circumstances, sign a violently abusive and insulting memorial to Congress, urging in the most decided manner the adoption of fatal measures toward the banks, by compelling them to continue specie payments, when all the institutions of Virginia and Maryland had suspended, and thereby to be compelled to pursue a destructive and burdensome policy towards their customers."" ""The object of the memorial was to place something in the hands of our enemies, in the shape of an approval of their course, which was a gross deception."" ""This offense becomes greatly aggravated, when it is known that Mr. White knew, so far as his acquaintance went with his co-signers, that they were too grossly ignorant of business and banking to be able to express any opinion upon such a subject.  The other signers, with the exception of two or three, were so wholly unknown to our business community that Mr. White would not be able to identify their persons or designate their residences.  It is to be taken for granted that they were merely transient laborers, or persons so young as not then to have attracted the notice of our oldest and most observing citizens; some of them, indeed, were known to be small apprentices.  So offensive and unpopular was the whole proceeding that with the exception of perhaps two others (from whom our community would look for nothing better), Mr. White was the only respectable man of business who could be induced to put his name upon the paper.  His own purpose could never have been detected, but for his appointment as collector, which so soon succeeded.  Mr. White's experience in trade had taught him the indispensable necessity for banks in this district, and his intelligence and sense of justice were outraged by the declaration that our banks should be made to pay specie, when the banks of our neighboring states of Virginia and Maryland found it wholly impracticable so to do.  He knew the gentlemen who had the management of our banks, directors as well as officers, and he knew they stood without reproach, and that it was wholly impossible that they could be influenced by the low and disreputable designs which his memorial so unscrupulously charged to them.  It was a vile slander, put forth so as to evade the responsibility of a legal prosecution.  We think he is the last man to hold an office, the value of which depends upon the enterprise and integrity of the very men whose families and business were alike to be overwhelmed with ruin at his special application."" ""His removal from an office thus obtained would be doubly gratifying to us, when we know his family does not need its emoluments for support."" ""It can be proved that at his store, in which the office of collector is kept, there were almost nightly assemblages of the principal party men who sustained the late administration, and particularly during the fall of 1840. "" ""A highly respectable man has stated that, during the latter part of the late canvass, he saw Mr. White preparing immense numbers of the newspaper called the 'Washington Globe,' for circulation, but, being a neighbor of Mr. White, he is unwilling to appear as a witness against him.  The language the gentleman used was that 'he had seen bushels of the Golbe so prepared, since his appointment as collector.'"" ""Under these circumstances, we would most respectfully ask you to dismiss Mr. White from the office, and that our fellow townsman, Mr. Henry Addison, who has already been recommended by most of us, may be appointed to fill it."" ""O. M. LINTHICUM"" ""RAPHAEL SEMMES"" ""WM. ROBINSON"" ""E. M. LINTHICUM"" ""PEREGRINE WARFIELD"" ""ROBERT OULD"" ""WM. JEWELL"" ""WILLIAM LAIRD"" ""WM. LANG"" ""S.E. SCOTT"" ""WM. HAYMAN"" ""JOS. SMOOT"" ""WM. S. NICHOLS"" ""JAMES THOMAS"" ""JEREMIAH ORME"" ""T. P. WAUGH"" ""EDW. S. WRIGHT"" ""J. RILEY"" ""W. S. RINGGOLD"" ""J. I. STULL"" On the 19th of June, 1841, the following letter was addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury. ""Georgetown, June 19, 1841"" ""SIR:  About a year ago, the Hon. A. Duncan, of Ohio, was invited by a number of officeholders and others to hold a political meeting in this town."" ""The meeting was held on 26 June, 1840, and the proceedings were published in the Globe, on or about 3 July."" ""Mr. Robert White, our collector of customs, acted as one of the vice-presidents of the meeting, and who was so tickled and delighted with Duncan's vile calumnies upon Gen. Harrison, that he arose and made the motion that he (Duncan) would prepare the speech for publication.  The address was said to be one of the vilest, and, if you desire it, a copy shall be presented for your perusal.  The persons who moved the resolutions, and one of the secretaries, were clerks in the departments."" ""We now hand you a copy of two of the resolutions, and an account of the proceedings, which we present separate, for your immediate and convenient notice, referring you at the same time to the very lengthy account to be found in the Globe of the date mentioned above."" ""You will see that the copy now sent applies the following language to General Harrison:  'Nominee of the bank whigs, Federalists, abolitionists, and anti-masons.'  'Fraud and concealment' -- 'grossly insulting common sense, decency, and honesty, by shrouding himself in darkness' -- 'of courting dangerous fanatics, and   countenancing them in their mad warfare upon our peace, property, and lives.'  'He should be treated as an abolitionist.'"" ""This conduct of Mr. White, in connection with his signature being placed to the infamous anti-bank memorial, which a delegation from town left in your hands when Mr. White's removal was first requested, renders him extremely offensive to the whigs here.  We again would take the opportunity to remind you of our earnest hope that Mr. H. Addison will be appointed to that office, whose full and abundant testimonials are already in your possession."" ""The continuance of Mr. White is mortifying to every real friend of the administration here."" ""With respect, your obedient servants,"" ""O. M. LINTHICUM"" ""WILLIAM LAIRD"" ""WM. S. NICHOLLS"" ""Hon. T. EWING"" "" Secretary of the Treasury "" On 21 September, 1841, the following letter was addressed to the President. ""Georgetown, Sept. 21, 1841"" ""SIR:  Should any paper be sent to you, contradicting in any manner a representation made by ourselves to the conduct of Mr. White, late collector of this port, we will thank you to let us have a copy of that paper, with the names appended thereto, that we may see in what particular, and to what extent, our statement may have been contradicted, and by whom."" ""With great regard, we are, sir, your obedient servants,"" ""O M LINTHICUM,"" ""W ROBINSON,"" ""WILLIAM LAIRD,"" ""RAPH SEMMES,"" ""WM S NICHOLLS,"" ""D ENGLISH, JR"" ""To His Excellency, JOHN TYLER, President U.S."" And upon 23 September, 1841, the following: ""Georgetown, September 23, 1841"" ""SIR -- I feel bound to make to you this statement, in consequence of a report which has reached my ears, that Mr. Robert White, with Captain Carbery, and B. Mackall, are endeavoring, by their joint influence and representations, to injure me in your estimation.  It is due no less to you than to my friends and myself to write you this letter, in which I shall omit everything that is not really necessary to be stated."" ""As to Mr. White, I feel warranted in assuring you that the representations made to you by my friends in regard to him, are true throughout, of which fact they will be able to furnish you the   abundant evidence.  No man of character here would hazard the intimation that these friends of mine would possibly descend to a misrepresentation in regard to Mr. White or anyone else."" ""For all they have stated, they can produce a mass of evidence too strong to be doubted."" ""In relation to Mr. Carbery, I have only to refer you to my letter to you of 23 August and its accompanying papers.  I would take much pleasure in furnishing you with any further explanations in regard to that case that you might desire."" ""It is wholly impossible that Mr. Mackall can have the least ground for complaint, as I can supply you with abundant proof that there was no employment here for him whatever, nor any prospect of need of his services at any time hereafter.  All the labor performed by him, since I have been appointed to this office, was merely to sign a receipt for his pay.  He, or his friends for him, appealed to the Secretary of the Treasury, and seemed to have succeeded in producing an impression on his mind that I was meditating an unjust proceeding towards Mr. Mackall -- all this, too, before I had said or written a word to Mr. Ewing upon the subject.  He wrote me that Mr. Mackall must not be removed until I assigned him my reason for so doing.  I obeyed his order, but, on the very day I wrote him that there was no service for Mr. Mackall to perform, Mr. Ewing instructed me to discontinue the office.  Mr. Mackall still complained to the Secretary, who wrote me to come to the Treasury Department.  I went, and after hearing my statement, he said he was then satisfied that he had done what was proper in the case.  I did not feel at all hurt at the course taken by Mr. Ewing, because I knew that the whole matter had been grossly misrepresented to him.  I had been waited upon by a friend, who earnestly remonstrated with me upon the subject of abolishing Mr. Mackall's office; as he said that, in that case, the influence of a powerful family connection would be immediately wielded against me.  I did not exactly see the propriety of being governed by such apprehensions, and took the course prompted by my sense of duty, and relying confidently upon the favorable result of an impartial investigation, should any difficulty occur."" ""There is but little revenue collected at this port, and I felt it to be my duty to conduct its business with as little expense as possible.  I found the expense of this office, as far as Georgetown is concerned, to be $2,573.34."" ""I have reduced these expenses to the sum of $1,045.00."" ""Thus saving to the government, $1,428.34 without at all impairing the efficiency of the service.  The whole expense of the office for Georgetown is now absolutely $45 a year less than Mr. Mackall was receiving for doing nothing.  The expenses in Washington I have reduced twenty-five percent I did   this from a sense of duty, but not without anticipating much misrepresentation and abuse."" ""I am, sir, with great regard, your obedient servant,"" ""H. ADDISON"" ""To the PRESIDENT"" On 18 November, 1841, Robert White brought the two suits mentioned in the titling of this statement. The declaration in the suit against Nicholls and others contained two counts. The first was as follows: ""And whereupon the said plaintiff, by Brent & Brent and Francis S. Key, his attorneys, complains, for that whereas previous to, and at the time of committing of the several grievances by the defendants as hereinafter mentioned, the plaintiff was collector of the customs for the district, and inspector of the revenue for the port of Georgetown in the District of Columbia; yet the defendants, well knowing the premises, but greatly envying the happy state and condition of the said plaintiff, and contriving, and wickedly and maliciously intending to injure the plaintiff in his good name, fame, and credit, and to bring him into public scandal, infamy, and disgrace, with and amongst all his neighbors, and other good and worthy citizens of the county aforesaid, and to cause the plaintiff to be removed from his said office, heretofore, to-wit, on 20 June, 1841, at Georgetown, to-wit, at the county aforesaid, falsely, wickedly, and maliciously did compose and publish, and caused to be composed and published, of and concerning the plaintiff, and of and concerning his aforesaid office, and of and concerning the plaintiff's conduct in his said office, for the purpose of procuring his removal from said office, a certain false, malicious, and defamatory libel, containing, amongst other things, the false, scandalous, malicious, defamatory, and libelous matter of and concerning the plaintiff, and of and concerning his aforesaid office, and of and concerning his said plaintiff's conduct in his said office, for the purpose of procuring the removal of the plaintiff from his said office, as follows, that is to say:  [then followed a copy of the letter to the President of June 26, 1841, down to the words 'delivered by that gentleman,' with the necessary innuendoes]."" The second count was as follows: ""And whereas also the said defendants, intending and contriving to cause the plaintiff to be removed from the office then held by him, as stated in the first count heretofore, to-wit, on 26 June, 1841, at Georgetown, to-wit, at the county aforesaid, falsely, wickedly, and maliciously did compose and publish, and cause to be composed and published, of and concerning the plaintiff, and of and concerning his office, and of and concerning his conduct in his said office, and for the purpose of procuring his removal from his said office, a certain other false, malicious, and defamatory libel, containing, amongst other things, the following false, scandalous, malicious, defamatory, and libelous   matter of and concerning the plaintiff, and of and concerning his said office, and of and concerning his, said plaintiff's, conduct in his said office, and for the purpose of procuring the plaintiff's removal from his said office, that is to say: "" ""Mr. White's was the place &c., [then followed the remainder of the letter not included in the first count]."" The declaration concluded as follows: ""By reason of publishing of which said several libels, the said plaintiff saith, that he hath been and is greatly injured in his good name, fame, and credit, with and amongst all his neighbors, friends, and acquaintance.  And by reason of the publishing of which said several libels, the plaintiff saith that he was heretofore, to-wit, on 12 July, 1841, at the county aforesaid, removed from his office aforesaid, and was thereby deprived of the emoluments and income of said office, amounting to a large sum of money, to-wit, the sum of three thousand dollars annually, and hath been otherwise greatly injured, whereby the said plaintiff saith that he hath damage, and is the worse, to the value of twenty-five thousand dollars, and therefore he brings suit, and so forth."" ""BRENT & BRENT,  for plaintiff "" The declaration in the suit against Addison also contained two counts, with no essential variation from the above. The defendants pleaded not guilty, and in November, 1842, the causes came on for trial.  They were tried together, the same evidence and instructions prayed from the court being common to both.  The jury, under the direction of the court, found a verdict of ""not guilty,"" and the following bills of exceptions show the points of law which were raised and ruled. "" Plaintiff's 1st Bill of Exceptions ""  ""In the trial of these causes, the plaintiff, to support the issues on his part, offered evidence to show that he was duly appointed to the office set forth and described in the declaration, on 21 July, 1840; and that he was acting as such officer from that time till 9 July, 1841, when he was removed from office, and the defendant, Henry Addison, appointed in his place, and then further offered in evidence a written paper,  viz.,  the letter to the President, and proved that the same was in the handwriting of the defendant Addison, and that the signatures thereto were in the handwriting, respectively, of the several defendants; that the said paper so written and subscribed was sent to the President of the United States, and by him sent to the Treasury Department, where it was filed on or before 30 June, 1841, and kept by a clerk of that department having charge of such papers, and shown on one occasion to one person by him -- which person had called to see it at the request of the plaintiff; and also on another occasion to another person. "" ""And the plaintiff further offered evidence that one of the said defendants, whom he named, said, about the time of signing the said paper, and before the plaintiff was turned out of office, that the plaintiff had signed a memorial against the banks in the district, and swore that he would have him turned out of office."" ""And also offered evidence that another of said defendants, also named, had on one occasion said, after the said paper had been sent to the President, that he had made no charges against the plaintiff, and on another occasion he stated he had made charges, and that he could prove against the plaintiff more than he had so charged."" ""And the plaintiff further proved that the said paper, so written and subscribed, was shown to a citizen of Georgetown for the purpose of being subscribed by him, who refused so to do, because he was not acquainted with all the facts stated in said paper."" ""And the plaintiff, upon the evidence aforesaid, offered thereupon to read the said paper to the jury; but the court refused to allow the said paper to be read in evidence to the jury."" ""To which refusal of the court the plaintiff excepts, and prays the court to sign and seal this bill of exceptions, which is done accordingly, this 3 January, 1843."" ""B. THRUSTON     [SEAL]"" ""JAS. S. MORSELL [SEAL]"" "" Plaintiff's 2d Bill of Exceptions ""  ""And the plaintiff further offered, after the evidence aforesaid in former exceptions had been given, to show the malice of defendants in writing, signing, and presenting said paper, to read the said paper, and offered evidence in connection therewith of the falsehood of the charge therein stated, which the court also refused, and the plaintiff excepts to said refusal, and prays the court to sign and seal this bill of exceptions, which is done accordingly, this 3 January, 1843."" ""B. THRUSTON     [SEAL]"" ""JAS. S. MORSELL [SEAL]"" "" Plaintiff's 3d bill of Exceptions ""  ""And the plaintiff, after the evidence was offered, as stated in the first and second bills of exceptions, and after the opinion had been given by the court, as therein stated, then offered to prove by substantial evidence, for the purpose of showing malice in the defendants in writing, signing, and presenting the said paper, that the charge contained in the said paper, of the plaintiff's having lost the confidence of the men from whose labors and enterprise the emoluments of his office flowed, was false, malicious, and without probable cause; that all the persons doing business with the said plaintiff, as such officer in his said office, during all the time of his continuing in office, were General Walter Smith, Henry McPherson, John Hopkins, and Jabez Travers -- all which persons the plaintiff   now offers as witnesses to prove that the plaintiff had never lost their confidence, but that they always continued their confidence in the plaintiff, and approved of his conduct as such officer.  And also, further to falsify the said charge, the plaintiff offers to prove that an election was held in Georgetown, in February, 1841 and 1842, for a common councilman in said town, in which election a majority of the qualified voters of said town voted for the plaintiff; and he was elected to the common council, notwithstanding the active opposition of several of the defendants."" ""And the plaintiff, also, further offered to prove that the charges in the said paper of the plaintiff's having descended to the lowest means to secure the favor of the late administration, and that he procured Doctor Duncan to deliver a speech in Georgetown in the abuse of General Harrison; and that the plaintiff's was the place where the leading members of his party nightly assembled up to the close of the presidential election, and that the plaintiff, since his appointment to his said office, had distributed bushels of the Globe, were false, malicious, and without probable cause, by producing witnesses to falsify and disprove the said charges, and show that there was no foundation or probable cause for said charges."" ""But the court was of opinion that such evidence was inadmissible, and refused to allow the same to be given in evidence to the jury; to which refusal the plaintiff by his counsel excepts, and prays the court to sign and seal this bill of exceptions, which is done accordingly, this 3 January, 1843."" ""W. CRANCH       [SEAL]"" ""JAS. S.

 Syllabus   Even though a question of law be raised by an order of the Postmaster General excluding matter from the mails, the court will not interfere unless clearly of the opinion that the order is wrong.   Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne,   194 U. S. 106 . Every series of printed papers published at definite intervals is not necessarily a periodical within the meaning of the provisions of the Act of March 3, 1879, c. 180, 20 Stat. 355, defining second-class mail matter. Books that are expressly embraced by § 17 of the Act of March 3, 1879, as third-class matter and subject to the higher rate of postage cannot be made second-class matter by simply publishing them at regular intervals, even though, as in this case, purporting to be a series of adventures of the same person.   Houghton v. Payne,   194 U. S. 88 . ""Periodical,"" as used in the Act of March 3, 1879, implies that no single number of a series is a complete book in itself. As a general rule, with few exceptions, a printed publication is a book within the meaning of § 17 of the Act of March 3, 1879, when its contents are complete in themselves, deal with a single subject, need no continuation and have appreciable size, and so  held  that the publications involved in this case are books, and not periodicals. Where the point to be decided is a pure question of law which can be reviewed by the courts, the Postmaster General satisfies the requirements of the Act of March 3, 1901, c. 851, 31 Stat. 1099, 1107, by simply hearing the party claiming to be aggrieved by an order excluding matter from the mail, and one so heard, and who is not prevented from offering material evidence, cannot complain in the court reviewing the order that he was denied a hearing under the act. 34 App. D.C. 521 and 535 affirmed.  The facts, which involve the validity of orders of the Postmaster-General excluding appellants' publications from second-class mail privileges, are stated in the opinion. "

 OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   Motions in arrest of judgment are not favored. In considering a motion in arrest, the plaintiff will be given the benefit of every implication that can be drawn from the pleading, liberally construed, and even if the allegations are defectively set forth or improperly arranged, if they show facts constituting a good cause of action, the motion will be denied. Where the defendant in a suit for libel is put on notice of extrinsic facts surrounding the publication, and does not demur, but joins issue and goes to trial, a verdict against him cures the defects in the complaint and a motion to arrest should not be granted. The strict rules announced in earlier decisions in this respect have been modified by modern and more liberal rules of pleading. Where plaintiff in error in this Court succeeded in the trial court and was reversed in the intermediate appellate court, this Court is not limited to a consideration of the points presented, but must enter the judgment which should have been rendered by the court below on the record before it. Although this Court reverses the order to arrest the judgment, it affirms the ruling of the intermediate appellate court that there should be a new trial on account of erroneous instructions on material matters. Where the words are not libelous  per se  and can only be construed as such in the light of extrinsic facts, it is for the jury not only to determine whether the extrinsic facts exist, but also whether the words have the defamatory meaning attributed to them. 36 App.D.C. 493 reversed. The plaintiff, Baker, United States district attorney for the District of Columbia, sued the defendant, Warner, for libel.  Briefly stated, the complaint charges that: The Washington Jockey Club owned a race track in   the District where races were run and bets were made, and in January, 1908, the plaintiff, as district attorney, had obtained from the grand jury an indictment charging one Walters with betting at this race track, contrary to the statute against gaming in the District.  A demurrer was filed, which was sustained on March 11, 1908, the court holding that the laying of bets on horse races at this track was not a violation of the Act of Congress, which, as appears by reference to the statute (March 3, 1901, § 869, 31 Stat. p. 1331, c. 854), only prohibited such betting and bookmaking within one mile of the boundaries of the Cities of Washington and Georgetown.  The plaintiff immediately took an appeal from this judgment in order that the Court of Appeals might determine whether such betting at such place was a violation of the gaming law of force in the District. Shortly after the appeal, the Spring Meet of the Jockey Club began, being advertised to continue until April 14th.  On the opening days of the Meet, there were bookmaking and betting, but the complainant alleges that the plaintiff, ""conforming himself, as it was his duty to do, to the law as judicially construed by the Supreme Court of the District, did not issue warrants for the arrest of or present to the grand jury any persons for betting on the horse races."" It is further alleged that, at this time, Warner was a candidate against Pearre for the nomination for Congress from Maryland, and, on March 28th, Warner composed and published, of and concerning the plaintiff and of and concerning the office of the plaintiff, in a Washington newspaper, a certain false and defamatory libel.  The article need not be set out at length, but the communication, after characterizing a speech by his opponent as undignified, proceeded to say that it was not wanting in dignity so much as for a judge of the District ""who, with the United States District Attorney (meaning the   plaintiff), went to Rockville (meaning the Town of Rockville, County of Montgomery, State of Maryland) last Saturday (meaning Saturday, the 21st day of March A.D.1908) to attend a conference of Mr. Warner's (meaning defendant's) enemies, and determine what ammunition was needed to defeat him."" ""The question now is, where does the money come from in the contest against Mr. Warner? (meaning the defendant)."" ""How about the race track?"" ""Lawyer"" ""meaning thereby . . . that the said plaintiff entered into a conference with others for the purpose of determining what funds were necessary, and how same should be raised, to be used in the campaign in behalf of Pearre, and meaning . . . that the plaintiff was and is corrupt in not presenting to the grand jury and prosecuting before the courts of the District persons laying bets upon the contests at the race track, in consideration of contributions of money in the contest against the defendant from some company or person interested in the race track or the contests carried on thereon."" The defendant filed a general denial, and, after a trial, there was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.  Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were overruled and the case taken to the Court of Appeals, which held not only that reversible error had been committed, but that the judgment should have been arrested.  In No. 41, the case is here on a writ to review that ruling.  To avoid any question as to the finality of that judgment of the Court of Appeals, plaintiff sued out another writ of error (No. 42) after the judgment had been arrested in the trial court. "

 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO
 Syllabus   Where provisions for censorship of moving pictures relate only to films intended for exhibition within the state and they are distributed to persons within the state for exhibition, there is no burden imposed on interstate commerce. The doctrine of original package does not extend to moving picture films transported, delivered, and used as shown in the record in this case, although manufactured in, and brought from, another state. Moving picture films brought from another state to be rented or sold by the consignee to exhibitors are in consumption and mingled as much as from their nature they can be with other property of the state, and subject to its otherwise valid police regulation, even before the consignee delivers to the exhibitor. The judicial sense, supporting the common sense of this country, sustains the exercise of the police power of regulation of moving picture exhibitions. The exhibition of moving pictures is a business, pure and simple, originated and conducted for profit like other spectacles, and not to be regarded as part of the press of the country or as organs of public opinion within the meaning of freedom of speech and publication guaranteed by the Constitution of Ohio. This Court will not anticipate the decision of the state court as to the application of a police statute of the state to a state of facts not involved in the record of the case before it.   Quaere  whether moving pictures exhibited in places other than places of amusement should fall within the provisions of the censorship statute of Ohio. While administration and legislation are distinct powers and the line that separates their exercise is not easily defined, the legislature must declare the policy of the law and fix the legal principles to control in given cases, and an administrative body may be clothed with power to ascertain facts and conditions to which such policy and principles apply. It is impossible to exactly specify such application in every instance, and the general terms of censorship, while furnishing no exact standard   of requirements may get precision from the sense and experience of men and become certain and useful guides in reasoning and conduct.  Whether provisions in a state statute clothing a board or Congress composed of officers from that and other states with power amount to such delegation of legislative power as to render the provisions unconstitutional will not be determined by this Court in a case in which it appears that such Congress is still nonexistent. The moving picture censorship act of Ohio of 1913 is not in violation of the federal Constitution or the Constitution of the State of Ohio either as depriving the owners of moving pictures of their property without due process of law or as a burden on interstate commerce, or as abridging freedom and liberty of speech and opinion, or as delegating legislative authority to administrative officers. 215 F. 138 affirmed. Appeal from an order denying appellant, herein designated complainant, an interlocutory injunction sought to restrain the enforcement of an act of the General Assembly of Ohio passed April 16, 1913 (103 Ohio Laws 399), creating under the authority and superintendence of the Industrial Commission of the state a board of censors of motion picture films.  The motion was presented to three judges, upon the bill, supporting affidavits, and some oral testimony. The bill is quite voluminous.  It makes the following attacks upon the Ohio statute:  (1) the statute is in violation of §§ 5, 16 and 19 of Article 1 of the constitution of the state in that it deprives complainant of a remedy by due process of law by placing it in the power of the board of censors to determine from standards fixed by itself what films conform to the statute, and thereby deprives complainant of a judicial determination of a violation of the law; (2) the statute is in violation of Articles I and XIV of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and of § 11 of Article 1 of the Constitution of Ohio in that it restrains complainant and other persons from freely writing and publishing their sentiments; (3) it attempts to give the board of censors legislative power,   which is vested only in the general assembly of the state, subject to a referendum vote of the people, in that it gives to the board the power to determine the application of the statute without fixing any standard by which the board shall be guided in its determination, and places it in the power of the board, acting with similar boards in other states, to reject, upon any whim or caprice, any film which may be presented, and power to determine the legal status of the foreign board or boards, in conjunction with which it is empowered to act. The business of the complainant and the description, use, object, and effect of motion pictures and other films contained in the bill, stated narratively, are as follows:  complainant is engaged in the business of purchasing, selling, and leasing films, the films being produced in other states than Ohio, and in European and other foreign countries.  The film consists of a series of instantaneous photographs or positive prints of action upon the stage or in the open.  By being projected upon a screen with great rapidity, there appears to the eye an illusion of motion.  They depict dramatizations of standard novels, exhibiting many subjects of scientific interest, the properties of matter, the growth of the various forms of animal and plant life, and explorations and travels; also events of historical and current interest -- the same events which are described in words and by photographs in newspapers, weekly periodicals, magazines, and other publications, of which photographs are promptly secured a few days after the events which they depict happen, thus regularly furnishing and publishing news through the medium of motion pictures under the name of ""Mutual Weekly.""  Nothing is depicted of a harmful or immoral character. The complainant is selling and has sold during the past year for exhibition in Ohio an average of fifty-six positive prints of films per week to film exchanges doing business in that state, the average value thereof being the sum of   $100, aggregating $6,000 per week, or $300,000 per annum. In addition to selling films in Ohio, complainant has a film exchange in Detroit, Michigan, from which it rents or leases large quantities to exhibitors in the latter state and in Ohio.  The business of that exchange and those in Ohio is to purchase films from complainant and other manufacturers of films and rent them to exhibitors for short periods at stated weekly rentals.  The amount of rentals depends upon the number of reels rented, the frequency of the changes of subject, and the age or novelty of the reels rented.  The frequency of exhibition is described.  It is the custom of the business, observed by all manufacturers, that a subject shall be released or published in all theaters on the same day, which is known as release day, and the age or novelty of the film depends upon the proximity of the day of exhibition to such release day.  Films so shown have never been shown in public, and the public to whom they appeal is therefore unlimited.  Such public becomes more and more limited by each additional exhibition of the reel. The amount of business in renting or leasing from the Detroit exchange for exhibition in Ohio aggregates the sum of $1,000 per week. Complainant has on hand at its Detroit exchange at least 2,500 reels of films which it intends to and will exhibit in Ohio, and which it will be impossible to exhibit unless the same shall have been approved by the board of censors.  Other exchanges have films, duplicate prints of a large part of complainant's films, for the purpose of selling and leasing to parties residing in Ohio, and the statute of the state will require their examination and the payment of a fee therefor.  The amounts of complainant's purchases are stated, and that complainant will be compelled to bear the expense of having them censored because its customers will not purchase or hire uncensored films. The business of selling and leasing films from its offices   outside of the State of Ohio to purchasers and exhibitors within the state is interstate commerce, which will be seriously burdened by the exaction of the fee for censorship, which is not properly an inspection tax, and the proceeds of which will be largely in excess of the cost of enforcing the statute, and will in no event be paid to the Treasury of the United States. The board has demanded of complainant that it submit its films to censorship, and threatens, unless complainant complies with the demand, to arrest any and all persons who seek to place on exhibition any film not so censored or approved by the censor congress on and after November 4, 1913, the date to which the act was extended.  It is physically impossible to comply with such demand and physically impossible for the board to censor the films with such rapidity as to enable complainant to proceed with its business, and the delay consequent upon such examination would cause great and irreparable injury to such business, and would involve a multiplicity of suits. There were affidavits filed in support of the bill and some testimony taken orally.  One of the affidavits showed the manner of shipping and distributing the films, and was as follows: ""The films are shipped by the manufacturers to the film exchanges enclosed in circular metal boxes, each of which metal boxes is in turn enclosed in a fiber or wooden container.  The film is in most cases wrapped around a spool or core in a circle within the metal case.  Sometimes the film is received by the film exchange wound on a reel, which consists of a cylindrical core with circular flanges to prevent the film from slipping off the core, and when so wound on the reel is also received in metal boxes, as above described.  When the film is not received on a reel, it is, upon receipt, taken from the metal box, wound on a reel, and then replaced in the metal box.  So wound and so enclosed in metal boxes, the films are shipped by the film   exchanges to their customers.  The customers take the film as it is wound on the reel from the metal box, and exhibit the pictures in their projecting machines, which are so arranged as to permit of the unwinding of the film from the reel on which it is shipped.  During exhibition, the reel of film is unwound from one reel and rewound in reverse order on a second reel.  After exhibition, it must be again unwound from the second reel from its reverse position and replaced on the original reel in its proper position.  After the exhibitions for the day are over, the film is replaced in the metal box and returned to the film exchange, and this process is followed from day to day during the life of the film."" ""All shipments of films from manufacturers to film exchanges, from film exchanges to exhibitors, and from exhibitors back to film exchanges, are made in accordance with regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission, one of which provides as follows:"" ""   Moving picture films must be placed in metal cases, packed in strong and tight wooden boxes of fiber pails."" Another of the affidavits divided the business as follows: ""The motion picture business is conducted in three branches -- that is to say, by manufacturers, distributors, and exhibitors, the distributors being known as film exchanges. . . .  Film is manufactured and produced in lengths of about 1,000 feet, which are placed on reels, and the market price per reel of film of a thousand feet in length is at the rate of 10 cents per foot, or $100.  Manufacturers do not sell their film direct to exhibitors, but sell to film exchanges, and the film exchanges do not resell the film to exhibitors, but rent it out to them."" After stating the popularity of motion pictures, and the demand of the public for new ones, and the great expense their purchase would be to exhibitors, the affidavit proceeds as follows: ""For that reason, film exchanges came into existence, and film exchanges such as the Mutual Film Corporation are like clearing houses or circulating libraries, in that they purchase the film and rent it out to different exhibitors.  One reel of film being made today serves in many theaters from day to day until it is worn out.  The film exchange, in renting out the films, supervises their circulation."" An affidavit was filed, made by the ""general secretary of the national board of censorship of motion pictures, whose office is at No. 50 Madison Avenue, New York City.""  The ""national board,"" it is averred, ""is an organization maintained by voluntary contributions, whose object is to improve the moral quality of motion pictures.""  Attached to the affidavit was a list of subjects submitted to the board which are ""classified according to the nature of said subjects into scenic, geographic, historical, classical, and educational and propagandistic.""

 Syllabus   Where the highest court of the state, in overruling a demurrer, affirmed that the Constitution of the United States guaranteed freedom of speech, but held the statute on which the indictment was based valid in that respect and also that it was not bad for uncertainty, citing cases decided by this Court as authority, this Court may gather that rights under the federal Constitution were relied on apart from the certificate of the state court to that effect, and there is jurisdiction under § 237, Judicial Code, to review the judgment. The statute of the Washington, Rem. & Bal.Code, § 2564, denouncing the willful printing, circulation, etc., of matter advocating or encouraging the commission of any crime or breach of the peace or which shall tend to encourage or advocate disrespect for law or any court or courts of justice  held  not to be unconstitutional as the same has been construed by the highest court of that state and applied in the case of one indicted for publishing an article encouraging and inciting that which the jury found was a breach of state laws against indecent exposure. Statutes should be construed, so far as they fairly may be, in such a way as to avoid doubtful constitutional questions, and this Court presumes that state laws will be so construed by state courts. If the statute attacked should be construed as going no further than it is necessary to go in order to decide the particular case involved within it, it cannot be condemned for want of definiteness. Laws of the description of the statute of Washington involved in this action and prohibiting encouragement of crime are not unfamiliar. This Court has nothing to do with the wisdom of the defendant, the prosecution, or the act.  It is concerned only with the question whether the statute and its application infringes the federal Constitution. 71 Wash. 185 affirmed. The facts, which involve the constitutionality under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of   a statute of the Washington preventing the willful printing and circulation of written matter having tendency to encourage or advocate disrespect for the law, are stated in the opinion.

 Syllabus   The First Amendment, while prohibiting legislation against free speech as such, was not intended to give immunity to every possible use of language.  P.   249 U. S. 206 . A conspiracy to obstruct recruiting by words of persuasion merely,  viz.,  by circulating newspaper publications, with overt acts, is within the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, and within the power of Congress to punish.  Pp.   249 U. S. 206 ,   249 U. S. 208 .   Schenck v. United States, ante,   249 U. S. 47 . After conviction under an indictment charging such a conspiracy and, as overt acts, the circulation of newspapers containing articles which might well tend to effect its object if circulated in certain places, the court must assume, in the absence of a bill of exceptions, that the evidence as to the quarters reached by the newspapers and the  scienter  and expectation of the defendant was sufficient to sustain the conviction.  P.   249 U. S. 208 . A conspiracy to obstruct recruiting in violation of the Espionage Act is criminal even when no means have been specifically agreed on to carry out the intent, and hence it is not an objection to an indictment that means are not alleged.  P.   249 U. S. 209 . Neither, in such an indictment, is it necessary to allege that false reports were made or intended to be made.   Id. An allegation that defendants conspired to accomplish an object necessarily alleges their intent to do so.   Id. Under § 4 of the Espionage Act of 1917, the overt acts are sufficiently alleged as done to effect the object of the conspiracy.   Id. An indictment is not bad for duplicity in setting up in a single count a conspiracy to commit two offenses; the conspiracy is a unit, however diverse its objects.   Id. There is no merit in the suggestion that acts which are not treasonable cannot be punished under the Espionage Act of 1917 upon the theory that other acts included in the statute amount to treason, and can only be punished as such.  P.   249 U.S. 210 . The amendment of 1918 did not affect indictments found under the Espionage Act of 1917.   Id.   Abuse of discretion is not established by the facts that, upon overruling a demurrer to an indictment, the district court on the next day ordered a plea of not guilty to be entered, refused a continuance, empaneled a jury out of those previously called to meet on that day for the term, and set the trial to begin on the day following.   Id. Affirmed. The case is stated in the opinion."

 Syllabus   The delivery of a speech in such word and such circumstances that the probable effect will be to prevent recruiting, and with that intent, is punishable under the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, § 3, 40 Stat. 217, as amended by the Act of May 16, 1918, c. 75, § 1, 40 Stat. 553.  P.   249 U. S. 212 . Such a speech is not protected because of the fact that the purpose to oppose the war and obstruct recruiting, and the expressions used in that regard, were but incidental parts of a general propaganda of socialism and expressions of a general and conscientious belief.  P.   249 U. S. 215 . In a prosecution for obstructing and attempting to obstruct recruiting, by a speech in which defendant expressed sympathy with others, imprisoned for similar offenses, the ground for whose convictions he purported to understand,  held  that the records in the other cases were admissible as tending to explain the subject and true import of defendant's remarks and his intent.   Id. In such prosecution,  held  that a document -- a so-called ""Anti-War Proclamation and Program"" -- expressing and advocating opposition to the war was admissible against the defendant as evidence of his intent in connection with other evidence that, an hour before his speech, he expressed his approval of such platform.   Id. Semble  that persons designated by the Draft Act of May 18, 1917, registered and enrolled under it and thus subject to be called into active service, are part of the military forces of the United States within the meaning of § 3 of the Espionage Act.  P.   249 U. S. 216 . Affirmed. The case is stated in the opinion. "

 Syllabus   Evidence  held  sufficient to connect the defendants with the mailing of printed circulars in pursuance of a conspiracy to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service, contrary to the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917.  P   249 U. S. 49 .  Incriminating document seized under a search warrant directed against a Socialist headquarters,  held  admissible in evidence, consistently with the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, in a criminal prosecution against the general secretary of a Socialist party, who had charge of the office.  P.   249 U. S. 50 . Words which, ordinarily and in many places, would be within the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment may become subject to prohibition when of such a nature and used in such circumstances a to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils which Congress has a right to prevent.  The character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done.  P.   249 U. S. 51 . A conspiracy to circulate among men called and accepted for military service under the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917, a circular tending to influence them to obstruct the draft, with the intent to effect that result, and followed by the sending of such circulars, is within the power of Congress to punish, and is punishable under the Espionage Act, § 4, although unsuccessful.

 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 Syllabus   The decision in another case of a constitutional question which formed the jurisdictional basis for a direct writ of error previously sued out under Jud.Code § 238 does not divest this Court of its jurisdiction to determine the other questions raised in the record.  P.   252 U. S. 242 . In order to constitute a conspiracy, within § 4 of the Espionage Act, to commit a substantive offense defined in § 3, it is not essential that the conspirators shall have agreed in advance upon the precise method of violating the law, and, while the averment of the conspiracy cannot be aided by the allegations of overt acts and the conspiracy is not punishable unless such acts were committed, they need not be in themselves criminal, still less constitute the very crime which is the object of the conspiracy.  P.   252 U. S. 243 . Averments in such an indictment that defendants unlawfully, willfully, or feloniously committed the forbidden acts import an unlawful motive.  P.   252 U.S. 244 . Whether statements contained in a pamphlet circulated by defendants tended to produce the consequences forbidden by the Espionage Act (§ 3), as alleged,  held  a matter to be determined by the jury, and not by the court on demurrer to the indictment.   Id. Evidence in the case examined and  held  sufficient to warrant the jury's finding that defendants, in violation of the Espionage Act, conspired to commit, and committed, the offense of attempting to cause insubordination and disloyalty and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces, and made and conveyed false statements with intent to interfere with the operation and success of those forces in the war with Germany by circulating pamphlets and other printed matter tending in the circumstances to produce those results.  P.   252 U. S. 245 . The fact that defendants distributed such pamphlets with a full understanding of their contents furnished of itself a ground for attributing to them an intent, and for finding that they attempted, to bring about any and all such consequences as reasonably might be anticipated from their distribution.  P.   252 U. S. 249 .  In a prosecution for circulating false statements with intent to interfere with the operation and success of the military and naval forces, in violation of the Espionage Act, § 3, where the falsity of the statements in question appears plainly, as a matter of common knowledge and public fact, other evidence on that subject is not needed in order to sustain a verdict of guilty.  P.   252 U. S. 250 . In such cases, it is for the jury to determine whether the statements circulated should be taken literally or in an innocent figurative sense, in view of the class and character of the people among whom the statements were circulated.  P.   252 U. S. 251 . To circulate such false statements recklessly, without effort to ascertain the truth, is equivalent to circulating them with knowledge of their falsity.   Id. The fact that the statements in question do not, to the common understanding, purport to convey anything new, but only to interpret or comment on matters pretended to be facts of public knowledge, does not remove them from the purview of § 3 of the Espionage Act.  P.   252 U. S. 252 . The insufficiency of one of several counts of an indictment upon which concurrent sentences have been imposed does not necessitate reversal where the other counts sustain the total punishment inflicted.   Id. Affirmed. The case is stated in the opinion."

 OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   1. The provision of the Espionage Law (Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, Title XII,  3, 40 Stat. 217) which denies the mails to newspapers and other publications violating its prohibitions was within the power of Congress.  P.   255 U. S. 409 . 2. The second-class mail privilege, previously granted for a newspaper, was revoked by the Postmaster General, upon due notice and hearing, because, from the time the United States entered the World War to the time of the revocation, the paper frequently and persistently printed articles conveying false reports and false statements with intent to promote the success of the enemies of the United States and constituting a willful attempt to cause disloyalty and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces and to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service.   Held  that the procedure satisfied due process of law, p.   255 U. S. 409 ; that the publication was clearly violative of § 3 of the Espionage Law, p.   255 U. S. 413 ; that the order did not deprive the publisher of constitutional rights of free speech, or free press, or of property without due process of law, and was amply justified by the evidence.  Pp.   255 U. S. 409 ,   255 U. S. 415 . 3. The conclusion of a head of an executive department upon a matter of fact within his jurisdiction will not be disturbed by the courts unless clearly wrong.  P.   255 U. S. 413 . 4. By long executive practice, admission to the second-class mail privilege is obtained for a publication only by a permit, issued by the Postmaster General, after a hearing and upon a showing satisfactory to him or his authorized assistants, that it contains and will continue to contain only mailable matter and that it will meet the other requirements of the law.  Pp.   255 U. S. 410 ,   255 U. S. 415 . 5. The power of the Postmaster General to revoke the privilege is an incident of the power to grant it, recognized by Congress (31 Stat. 1107) and by decisions of this Court.  Pp.   255 U. S. 411 ,   255 U. S. 415 .  6. When a newspaper which has been admitted to the second class privilege publishes nonmailable matter so frequently as to justify the presumption that it will continue to do so, the Postmaster General is empowered (Rev.Stats., § 36) to revoke the privilege not merely as to particular issue containing such matter, but indefinitely for the future, subject to the publisher's right to secure a renewal upon proper application and proof that the paper will conform to the law.  P.   255 U. S. 416 . 4 App.D.C. 26, 258 F. 282, affirmed.

 Syllabus   1.  Assumed,  for the purposes of the case, that freedom of speech and of the press are among the personal rights and liberties protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States.  P.   268 U. S. 666 . 2. Freedom of speech and of the press, as secured by the Constitution, is not an absolute right to speak or publish without responsibility whatever one may choose or an immunity for every possible use of language.  P.   268 U. S. 666 . 3. That a State, in the exercise of its police power, may punish those who abuse this freedom by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to corrupt public morals, incite to crime or disturb the public peace, is not open to question.  P.   268 U.S. 667 . 4. For yet more imperative reasons, a State may punish utterances endangering the foundations of organized government and threatening its overthrow by unlawful means.  P.   268 U.S. 667 . 5. A statute punishing utterances advocating the overthrow of organized government by force, violence and unlawful means, imports a legislative determination that such utterances are so inimical to the general welfare and involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be penalized under the police power, and this determination must be given great weight, and every presumption be indulged in favor of the validity of the statute.  P.   268 U. S. 668 . 6. Such utterances present sufficient danger to the public peace and security of the State to bring their punishment clearly within the range of legislative discretion, even if the effect of a given utterance cannot accurately be foreseen.

A State cannot reasonably be required to defer taking measures against these revolutionary utterances until they lead to actual disturbances of the peace or imminent danger of the State's destruction.  P.   268 U. S. 669 . 8. The New York statute punishing those who advocate, advise or teach the duty; necessity or propriety of overthrowing or overturning organized government by force, violence, or any unlawful means, or who print, publish, or knowingly circulate any book,   paper, etc., advocating, advising or teaching the doctrine that organized government should be so overthrown, does not penalize the utterance or publication of abstract doctrine or academic discussion having no quality of incitement to any concrete action, but denounces the advocacy of action for accomplishing the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means, and is constitutional as applied to a printed ""Manifesto"" advocating and urging mass action which shall progressively foment industrial disturbances and, through political mass strikes and revolutionary mass action, overthrow and destroy organized parliamentary government; even though the advocacy was in general terms, and not addressed to particular immediate acts or to particular person.

The statute being constitutional, it may constitutionally be applied to every utterance not too trivial to be beneath the notice of the law -- which is of such a character and used with such intent and purpose as to bring it within the prohibition of the statute, and the question whether the specific utterance in question was likely to bring about the substantive evil aimed at by the statute is not open to consideration.   Schenck v. United States,   249 U. S. 47 , explained.  P.   268 U. S. 670 . 195 App.Div. 77; 234 N.Y. 132, 539, affirmed. ERROR to a judgment of the Supreme Court of New York, affirmed by the Appellate Division thereof and by the Court of Appeals, sentencing the plaintiff in error for the crime of criminal anarchy, (New York Laws, 1909, c. 88), of which he had been convicted by a jury.

 DISTRICT, DIVISION ONE, OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   1. This Court acquires no jurisdiction to review the judgment of a state court of last resort on a writ of error unless it affirmatively appears on the face of the record that a federal question constituting an appropriate ground for such review was presented in and expressly or necessarily decided by such state court.  P.   274 U. S. 360 . 2. Where the fact that a federal question was considered and passed upon by the state court does not appear by the record, it may be shown by a certified copy of an order of that court made after the return of the writ of error and brought here as an addition to the record.  P.   274 U. S. 361 . 3. In reviewing the judgment of a state court, this Court will consider only such federal questions as are shown to have been presented to the state court and expressly or necessarily decided by it.  P.   274 U.S. 362 . 4. The question whether the petitioner, who joined and assisted in the organization of a Communist Labor Party contravening the California Criminal Syndicalism Act, did so with knowledge of its unlawful character and purpose, was a mere question of the weight of the evidence, foreclosed by the verdict of guilty approved by the state court, and not a question of the constitutionality of the Act, reviewable by this Court.  P.   274 U. S. 366 . 5. The California Criminal Syndicalism Act, which defines ""criminal syndicalism"" as ""any doctrine or precept advocating, teaching   or aiding and abetting the commission of crime, sabotage (which word is hereby defined as meaning willful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property), or unlawful acts of force and violence or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control, or effecting any political change,"" and declares guilty of a felony any person who ""organizes or assists in organizing, or is or knowingly becomes a member of, any organization, society, group or assemblage of persons organized or assembled to advocate, teach or aid and abet criminal syndicalism,"" is sufficiently clear and explicit to satisfy the requirement of due process of law.  P.   274 U. S. 368 . 6. The statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in penalizing those who advocate a resort to violent and unlawful methods as a means of changing industrial and political conditions while not penalizing those who may advocate a resort to such methods for maintaining such conditions, since the distinction is not arbitrary, but within the discretionary power of the State to direct its legislation against what it deems an evil without covering the whole field of possible abuses.  P.   274 U. S. 369 . 7. Such a statute is not open to objection unless the classification on which it is based is so lacking in any adequate or reasonable basis as to preclude the assumption that it was made in the exercise of the legislative judgment and discretion.  P.   274 U. S. 369 . 8. This Act is not class legislation; it affects all alike, no matter what their business associations or callings, who come within its terms and do the things prohibited.  P.   274 U. S. 370 . 9. Nor is it repugnant to the Due Process Clause as a restraint of the rights of free speech, assembly, and association.  P.   274 U. S. 371 . 10. The determination of the legislature that the acts defined involve such danger to the public peace and security of the State that they should be penalized in the exercise of the police power must be given great weight, and every presumption be indulged in favor of the validity of the statute, which could be declared unconstitutional only if an attempt to exercise arbitrarily and unreasonably the authority vested in the State in the public interest.  P.   274 U. S. 371 . 57 Cal. App. 449;  ib.,  453, affirmed. ERROR to a judgment of the District Court of Appeal of California, which affirmed a conviction of the petitioner under the state act against criminal syndicalism.  The Supreme Court of California denied a petition for appeal. On the first hearing in this Court, the writ of error was   dismissed for want of jurisdiction, but later a petition for rehearing was granted.  269 U.S. 530, 538."

To advocate among workers such acts as maliciously stowing the cargo of a ship so that it will shift and cause her to list and return to port is to teach and abet ""sabotage,"" which is defined by the California statute as meaning ""willful and malicious damage or injury to physical property;"" it is also to teach and abet ""crime"" and ""unlawful methods of terrorism.""

 Syllabus   1. A decision of a state court applying and enforcing a state statute of general scope against a particular transaction as to which there was a distinct and timely insistence that, if so applied, the statute was void under the federal Constitution necessarily affirms the validity of the statute as so applied, and the judgment is therefore reviewable by writ of error under § 237 of the Judicial Code.  P.   274 U. S. 385 . 2. The inquiry then is whether the statute is constitutional as applied and enforced in respect to the situation presented.  P.   274 U. S. 385 . 3. This Court will review the finding of facts by a state court where a federal right has been denied as the result of a finding shown by the record to be without evidence to support it; or where a conclusion of law as to a federal right, and a finding of fact, are so intermingled as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the federal question, to analyze the facts.  P.   274 U. S. 385 . 4. A Kansas statute defining ""criminal syndicalism"" as ""the doctrine which advocates crime, physical violence, arson, destruction of property, sabotage, or other unlawful acts or methods as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political ends, or as a   means of effecting industrial or political revolution, or for profit . . ."" and punishing any person who ""advocates, affirmatively suggests, or teaches the duty, necessity, propriety or expediency of crime, criminal syndicalism, or sabotage"" was applied by the state court as covering a case where it was charged and proved merely that the defendant secured members in an organzation whose constitution proclaimed ""[t]hat the working class and the employing class have nothing in common, and that there can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of working people and the few who make up the employing class have all the good things of life.  Between these two classes, a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the earth and the machinery of production, and abolish the wage system.  Instead of the conservative motto, 'A fair day's wage for a fair day's work,' we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, 'Abolition of the wage system.'  By organizing industrially, we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old."" Held:   that there being no charge or evidence that the organization advocated any crime, violence, or other unlawful acts or methods as a means of effecting industrial or political changes or revolution, thus applied, the statute is a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

California No. 584 Argued April 15, 1931 Decided May 18, 1931 283 U.S. 359 APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,
 FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT
 Syllabus   Appellant was charged under California Penal Code, § 403a, which condemns displaying a red flag in a public place or in a meeting place(a) ""as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government"" or (b) ""as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action"" or (c) ""as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character.""  These three purposes, which are expressed disjunctively in the statute, were alleged conjunctively in the information.  On her general demurrer to the information, which was overruled, she contended, as was permitted by the California practice, that the statute was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.  At the trial, the jury was instructed, following the express terms of the statute, that the appellant should be convicted if the flag was displayed for any of the three purposes.  There was a general verdict of guilty.  The appellant accepted this instruction, in the state appellate court, but insisted that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the statute was invalid as being an unwarranted limitation on the right of free speech.  The appellate court entertained the contention and decided adversely, expressing doubt of the validity of the statute as related to the first of the three clauses defining purpose (""opposition to organized government,"") but construing them as disjunctive and separable, and, upholding the statute as to the other two. Held: 1. That the objection of unconstitutionality, made in the court below, went not only to the statute as a whole, but to each of the three clauses separately.  P.   283 U. S. 365 . 2. Inasmuch as the case was submitted to the jury as permitting conviction under any or all of the three clauses, and inasmuch as it is impossible to determine from the general verdict upon which of the clauses the conviction rested, it follows that, if any of the clauses is invalid under the Constitution, the conviction cannot be upheld.  P.   283 U. S. 367 .  3. The conception of ""liberty "" under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment embraces the right of free speech.  P.   283 U. S. 368 . 4. The State may punish those who abuse the right of free speech by utterances which incite to violence and crime and threaten the overthrow of organized government.   Id. 5. There is no reason to doubt the validity of the second and third clauses of the statute, construed as they are, by the state court, as relating to such incitement to violence.  P.   283 U. S. 369 . 6. The first clause, condemning display of a flag ""as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government,"" construed by the state court as possibly including ""peaceful and orderly opposition to a government as organized and controlled by one political party, by those of another political party equally high minded and patriotic, which did not agree with the one in power,"" or ""peaceful and orderly opposition to government by legal means and within constitutional limitations"" -- is unconstitutional.   Id. 7. The maintenance of opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people, and that changes may be obtained by lawful means, is a fundamental principle of our constitutional system.   Id. 8. A statute which upon its face, and authoritatively construed, is so vague and indefinite as to permit the punishment of the fair use of this opportunity is repugnant to the guaranty of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment.   Id. 62 Cal. App. 788; 290 Pac. 93, reversed. APPEAL from a judgment affirming a conviction under § 403a of the Penal Code of California."

Minnesota No. 91 Argued January 30, 1931 Decided June 1, 1931 283 U.S. 697 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MINNESOTA
 Syllabus   1. A Minnesota statute declares that one who engages ""in the business of regularly and customarily producing, publishing,"" etc., ""a malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical,"" is guilty of a nuisance, and authorizes suits, in the name of the State, in which such periodicals may be abated and their publishers enjoined from future violations.  In such a suit, malice may be inferred from the fact of publication.  The defendant is permitted to prove, as a defense, that his publications were true and published ""with good motives and for justifiable ends.""  Disobedience of an injunction is punishable as a contempt.   Held  unconstitutional, as applied to publications charging neglect of duty and corruption upon the part of law-enforcing officers of the State.  Pp.   283 U. S. 704 ,   283 U.S. 709 ,   283 U. S. 712 ,   283 U. S. 722 . 2. Liberty of the press is within the liberty safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.  P.   283 U. S. 707 . 3. Liberty of the press is not an absolute right, and the State may punish its abuse.  P.   283 U. S. 708 . 4. In passing upon the constitutionality of the statute, the court has regard for substance, and not for form; the statute must be tested by its operation and effect.  P.   283 U. S. 708 .  5. Cutting through mere details of procedure, the operation and effect of the statute is that public authorities may bring a publisher before a judge upon a charge of conducting a business of publishing scandalous and defamatory matter -- in particular, that the matter consists of charges against public officials of official dereliction -- and, unless the publisher is able and disposed to satisfy the judge that the charges are true and are published with good motives and for justifiable ends, his newspaper or periodical is suppressed and further publication is made punishable as a contempt.  This is the essence of censorship.  P.   283 U. S. 713 . 6. A statute authorizing such proceedings in restraint of publication is inconsistent with the conception of the liberty of the press as historically conceived and guaranteed.  P.   283 U. S. 713 . 7. The chief purpose of the guaranty is to prevent previous restraints upon publication.  The libeler, however, remains criminally and civilly responsible for his libels.  P.   283 U. S. 713 . 8. There are undoubtedly limitations upon the immunity from previous restraint of the press, but they are not applicable in this case.  P.   283 U. S. 715 . 9. The liberty of the press has been especially cherished in this country as respects publications censuring public officials and charging official misconduct.  P.   283 U. S. 716 . 10. Public officers find their remedies for false accusations in actions for redress and punishment under the libel laws, and not in proceedings to restrain the publication of newspapers and periodicals.  P.   283 U. S. 718 . 11. The fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immunity from previous restraint in dealing with official misconduct.  P.   283 U. S. 720 . 12. Characterizing the publication of charges of official misconduct as a ""business,"" and the business as a nuisance, does not avoid the constitutional guaranty; nor does it matter that the periodical is largely or chiefly devoted to such charges.  P.   283 U. S. 720 . 13. The guaranty against previous restraint extends to publications charging official derelictions that amount to crimes.  P.   283 U. S. 720 . 14. Permitting the publisher to show in defense that the matter published is true and is published with good motives and for justifiable ends does not justify the statute.  P.   283 U. S. 721 . 15. Nor can it be sustained as a measure for preserving the public peace and preventing assaults and crime.  Pp.   283 U. S. 721 ,   283 U. S. 722 . 179 Minn. 40; 228 N.W. 326, reversed.

Lowry Nos. 474 and 475 Argued February 8, 1937 Decided April 26, 1937 301 U.S. 242 APPEALS FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA
 Syllabus   1. A federal constitutional question going to the validity of a conviction of crime under a state statute was not decided on an appeal to the state supreme court because not properly raised ( see Herndon v. Georgia,   295 U. S. 441 ).  Afterwards, that court considered the question and decided it against the convict, in a habeas corpus proceeding.   Held,  that the scope of habeas corpus, in the circumstances, was a local question, and that the ruling on the federal question was open to review by this Court.  P.   301 U. S. 247 . 2. A state statute punishing as a crime the acts of soliciting members for a political party and conducting meetings of a local unit of that party, where one of the doctrines of the party, established by reference to a document not shown to have been exhibited to anyone by the accused, may be said to be ultimate resort to violence in the indefinite future against organized government, unwarrantably invades the liberty of free speech and so violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  P.   301 U. S. 260 . 3. The power of a State to abridge freedom of speech and of assembly is the exception, rather than the rule; and the penalizing even of utterances of a defined character must find its justification in a reasonable apprehension of danger to organized government.  The limitation upon individual liberty must have appropriate relation to the safety of the State.  Legislation which goes beyond this need violates the Constitution.  P.   301 U. S. 258 . 4. The affirmance by the Supreme Court of a State of a conviction under a statute as having support in the evidence necessarily construes the statute as authorizing punishment for the act so proven.  P.   301 U. S. 255 . 5. Section 56 of the Penal Code of Georgia, as construed by the Supreme Court of the State, punishes, as an attempt to incite to insurrection, any attempt to induce others to join in any combined resistance to the lawful authority of the State.  As an element, the accused must have contemplated resistance by force, but in this respect he may be found guilty if he intended that an insurrection ""should happen during any time within which he might reasonably expect his influence to continue to be directly   operative in causing such action by those whom he sought to induce."" Held,  that the statute, as construed and applied in this case, is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment in that it furnishes no sufficiently ascertainable standard of guilt and interferes unduly with freedom of speech and of assembly.  Pp.   301 U. S. 253 ,   301 U. S. 261 . 12 Ga. 582, 186 S.E. 429, reversed. Appeals from judgments, rendered on cross-appeals, in a habeas corpus proceeding.  The court below sustained the trial court in deciding that the criminal statute involved did not infringe liberty of speech and assembly, but differed with its holding that the statute was too vague and indefinite, and reversed its decision discharging the appellant here."

 FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   In a suit to enjoin municipal officers from enforcing ordinances forbidding the distribution of printed matter, and the holding without permits of public meetings, in streets and other public places, Held: 1. The case is within the jurisdiction of the District Court.  Pp. 512-  307 U. S. 513 ,   307 U. S. 525 . 2. The ordinances and their enforcement violate the rights under the Constitution of the individual plaintiffs, citizens of the United States; but a complaining corporation cannot claim such rights.  P.   307 U. S. 514 . 3. The ordinances are void.  Pp.   307 U. S. 516 ,   307 U. S. 518 .  4. Provisions of the decree enjoining forcible removal of plaintiffs or exercise of personal restraint over them without warrant, or confinement without lawful arrest and production for prompt judicial hearing, saving lawful search and seizure, or interference with their free access to streets, parks or public places of the city -- are not vague and impracticable.  P.   307 U. S. 517 . 5. The decree properly enjoined interference with the right of plaintiffs, their agents etc., to communicate their views as individuals to others on the streets in an orderly and peaceable manner, reserving the right of defendants to enforce law and order by lawful search and seizure or arrest.  P.   307 U. S. 517 . 6. Insofar as the decree relates to distribution of literature and holding of meetings, the decree should enjoin enforcement of the void ordinances, and not undertake to enumerate the conditions under which those activities may he carried on.  P.   307 U. S. 518 . -----
 PER ROBERTS, J., with whom BLACK, J., concurred.  The CHIEF JUSTICE concurred in part (p.   307 U. S. 532 ). 1. The District Court lacked jurisdiction under Jud.Code § 24(1).  P.   307 U. S. 508 . (a) In suits under § 24(1), a traverse of the allegation as to the amount in controversy, or a motion to dismiss based upon the absence of such amount calls for substantial proof on the part of the plaintiff of facts justifying the conclusion that the suit involves the necessary sum.  P.   307 U. S. 507 . (b) The record in this suit is bare of any showing of the value of the asserted rights to the complainants individually.  P.   307 U. S. 508 . (c) Complainants may not aggregate their interests in order to attain the requisite jurisdictional amount.  P.   307 U. S. 508 . 2. The District Court had jurisdiction under Jud.Code, § 24(14).  P.   307 U. S. 513 . (a) Freedom to disseminate information concerning the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, to assemble peaceably for discussion of the Act and of the opportunities and advantages offered by it, is a privilege or immunity of a citizen of the United States secured against state abridgment by § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and R.S. § 1979 and Jud.Code § 24(14) afford redress in a federal court for such abridgment.  P.   307 U. S. 512 . (b) Natural persons alone are entitled to the privileges and immunities which § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment secures to   ""citizens of the United States.""  Only the individual complainants may maintain this suit.  P.   307 U. S. 514 . 3. The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but it must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied.  Distinguishing  Davis v. Massachusetts,   167 U. S. 43 .  P.   307 U. S. 515 . 4. The ordinance here in question, which forbids public assembly in the streets or parks of the city without a permit from the Director of Safety, who may refuse such permit upon his mere opinion that such refusal will prevent ""riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage,"" is void upon its face.  P.   307 U. S. 516 . It does not make comfort or convenience in the use of the streets or parks the standard of official action, and can be made the instrument of arbitrary suppression of free expression of views on national affairs.  Uncontrolled official suppression of the privilege of public assembly cannot be made a substitute for the duty to maintain order in connection with the exercise of the right. 5. The question whether exemption from the searches and seizures proscribed by the Fourth Amendment is afforded by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth is not involved.  P.   307 U. S. 517 . 6. An ordinance absolutely prohibiting distribution of circulars, handbills, placards, etc., in any street or public place is void.   Lovell v. Griffin,   303 U. S. 444 .  P.   307 U. S. 518 . -----
 Per STONE, J., with whom REED, J., concurred.  The CHIEF JUSTICE concurred in part (p.   307 U. S. 532 ). 1. Freedom of speech and of assembly for any lawful purpose are rights of personal liberty secured to all persons, without regard to citizenship, by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  P.   307 U. S. 519 . There is no occasion in this case to consider whether freedom of speech and of assembly are immunities secured by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to citizens of the United States. 2. The decree which is now affirmed is without support in the record, if the constitutional right of free speech and assembly is dependent on the privileges and immunities clause, rather than the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Complainants   are not alleged, shown, or found to be citizens of the United States.  The findings do not support the conclusion that the proposed meetings of complainants were for any purpose affecting the relationship between complainants and the United States or pertaining to United States citizenship.  The decree is not restricted to interferences with rights or immunities of United States citizenship, but enjoins unlawful interference with all meetings for lawful purposes and the lawful dissemination of all information.  Pp.   307 U. S. 522 -524. 3. The suit is maintainable under Jud.Code, § 24(14) as a suit for protection of rights and privileges guaranteed by the due process clause.  P.   307 U. S. 525 . The right of the individual complainants to maintain it conferred by § 24(14) does not depend on their citizenship and cannot rightly be made to turn on the existence or nonexistence of a purpose to disseminate information about the National Labor Relations Act. 4. The liberty guaranteed by the due process clause is the liberty of natural, not artificial, persons.  P.   307 U. S. 527 . A corporation cannot be said to be deprived of the civil rights of freedom of speech and of assembly. 5. The right conferred by the Civil Rights Act of April 20, 1871, to maintain a suit in equity in the federal courts to protect the suitor against a deprivation of rights or immunities secured by the Constitution has been preserved, and whenever the right is one of personal liberty, not dependent for its existence upon the infringement of property rights, there is jurisdiction in the district court under Jud.Code § 24(14) to entertain it without proof that the amount in controversy exceeds $3,000.  P.   307 U. S. 531 . Jud.Code § 24(1), conferring upon the district court jurisdiction of suits ""arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States"" in which the value in controversy exceeds the sum of $3,000, is not to be interpreted as requiring a different result. 101 F.2d 774, modified and affirmed. CERTIORARI, 306 U.S. 624, to review a decree which modified and affirmed a decree of injunction, 25 F.2d 127, in a suit brought by individuals, unincorporated labor organizations, and a membership corporation, against officials of a municipality to restrain alleged violations of constitutional rights of free speech and of assembly.

 Syllabus   1. The freedom of speech and of the press secured by the First Amendment against abridgment by the United States is similarly secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a State.  P.   308 U. S. 160 . 2. It is a duty of municipal authorities, as trustees for the public, to keep the streets open and available for movement of people and property -- the primary purpose to which the streets are dedicated, and, to this end, the conduct of those who use them may be regulated; but such regulation must not abridge the constitutional liberty of those who are rightfully upon the streets to impart information through speech or the distribution of literature.   Id. 3. The guaranty of freedom of speech and of the press does not deprive a municipality of power to enact regulations against standing   in the middle of a crowded street and obstructing traffic, or interfering with the passage of pedestrians in order to force their acceptance of tendered leaflets, or against throwing literature broadcast in the streets, since such conduct bears no necessary relationship to the freedom to speak, write, print or distribute information or opinion.  P.   308 U. S. 160 . 4. The purpose to keep the streets clean and neat is insufficient to justify an ordinance which prohibits a person rightfully on a public street from handing literature to one willing to receive it.  Any burden imposed upon the city authorities in cleaning and caring for the streets as an indirect consequence of such distribution results from the constitutional protection of the freedom of speech and press.  P.   308 U. S. 162 . There are obvious methods of preventing littering of the streets --  e.g.,  the punishment of those who actually throw papers on the streets. 5. The circumstance that, in the actual enforcement of an ordinance forbidding all distribution of literature in the streets, the distributor is arrested only if those who receive the literature throw it on the streets does not render the ordinance valid.  P.   308 U. S. 163 . 6. Ordinances forbidding distribution of printed matter are not made valid by limiting their operation to streets and alleys, and leaving other public places free.  P.   308 U. S. 163 . 7. A municipal ordinance prohibiting solicitation, and distribution of circulars, by canvassing from house to house, unless licensed by the police after an inquiry and decision amounting to censorship,  held  void as applied to one who delivered literature and solicited contributions from house to house in the name of religion.  P.   308 U. S. 163 . 121 N.J.L. 542, 3 A.2d 609; 33 Cal. App. 2d 747, 85 P.2d 231; 230 Wis. 131, 283 N.W. 301; 18 N.E.2d (Mass.) 166, reversed. Two of these four cases came up by appeal, and two by certiorari, 306 U.S. 628, 629, to review decision of state courts which upheld convictions under municipal ordinances forbidding or regulating distribution of literature in the streets or other public places.  In three of the cases, the acts charged took place in the streets.  The other was a case of circulars distributed by house to house visitations. "

Alabama No. 514 Argued February 29, 1940 Decided April 22, 1940 310 U.S. 88 CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF ALABAMA
 Syllabus   A statute of Alabama makes it unlawful for any person, ""without a just cause or legal excuse,"" to go near to or ""loiter"" about any place of lawful business, for the purpose of, or with the intention of, influencing or inducing other persons not to buy from, deal with, or be employed at such place of business; or to ""picket"" a place of lawful business for the purpose of impeding, interfering with, or injuring such business.  As construed by the courts of the State, the statute forbids the publicizing of facts concerning a labor dispute, whether by printed sign, by pamphlet, by word of mouth, or otherwise, in the vicinity of the business involved, and this without regard to the number of persons engaged in such activity, the peaceful character of their conduct, the nature of the dispute, or the accuracy or restraint of the language used in imparting the information.  Upon a complaint substantially in the words of the statute, and upon evidence of activities related to picketing of a place of business in connection with a labor dispute, petitioner was convicted of ""loitering and picketing as charged in the complaint.""  The statute was challenged as violative of freedom of speech and of the press. Held: 1. Freedom of speech and of the press, secured by the First Amendment against abridgment by the United States, is secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the States.  P.   310 U. S. 95 . 2. When abridgment of the effective exercise of the rights of freedom of speech and of the press is claimed, it is incumbent on the courts to ""weigh the circumstances"" and ""appraise the substantiality of the reasons advanced"" in support of the challenged regulations.  P.   310 U. S. 96 . 3. The statute must be judged upon its face.  P.   310 U. S. 96 . (a) The charges were framed in the words of the statute, and the finding was general; it is not necessary to consider whether the evidence would have supported a conviction based upon different and more precise charges.  P.   310 U. S. 96 . (b) The very existence of a penal statute such as that here, which does not aim specifically at evils within the allowable area of state control, but sweeps within its ambit other activities that, in ordinary circumstances, constitute an exercise of freedom of   speech or of the press, results in a continuous and pervasive restraint of all freedom of discussion that might reasonably be regarded as within its purview.  One convicted under such a statute does not have to sustain the burden of showing that the State could not constitutionally have written a different and specific statute covering the particular activities in which he is shown to have been engaged.  P.   310 U. S. 97 . (c) Where regulations of the liberty of free discussion are concerned, there are special reasons for observing the rule that it is the statute, and not the accusation or the evidence under it, which prescribes the limits of permissible conduct and warns against transgression.  P.   310 U. S. 98 . 4. The statute is invalid on its face.  P.   310 U. S. 101 . (a) Freedom of speech and of the press embraces, at the least, the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment.

P.   310 U. S. 102 . (c) Although the rights of employers and employees are subject to modification or qualification in the public interest, it does not follow that the State, in dealing with the evils arising from industrial disputes, may impair the effective exercise of the right to discuss freely industrial relations which are matters of public concern.  P.   310 U. S. 103 . (d) While the State may take adequate steps to preserve the peace and to protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its people, yet no clear and present danger of destruction of life or property, or invasion of the right of privacy, can be thought to be inherent in the activities of every person who approaches the premises of an employer and publicizes the facts of a labor dispute.  P.   310 U. S. 105 . (e) There is not here involved any question of picketing,  en masse  or otherwise conducted, which might occasion such imminent and aggravated danger to the community interests as to justify a statute narrowly drawn to cover the precise situation out of which the danger arises.  P.   310 U. S. 105 . (f) That it applies only when the proscribed activities are engaged in at the scene of a labor dispute cannot justify the statute.  P.   310 U.

 OF ERRORS OF CONNECTICUT
 Syllabus   1. The fundamental concept of liberty embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment.  P.   310 U. S. 303 . 2. The enactment by a State of any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.  P.   310 U. S. 303 . 3. Under the constitutional guaranty, freedom of conscience and of religious belief is absolute; although freedom to act in the exercise of religion is subject to regulation for the protection of society.  Such regulation, however, in attaining a permissible end, must not unduly infringe the protected freedom.  Pp.   310 U. S. 303 -304. 4. A state statute which forbids any person to solicit money or valuables for any alleged religious cause, unless a certificate therefor shall first have been procured from a designated official, who is required to determine whether such cause is a religious one and who may withhold his approval if he determines that it is not, is a previous restraint upon the free exercise of religion, and a deprivation of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  P.   310 U. S. 304 . So  held  as it was applied to persons engaged in distributing literature purporting to be religious, and soliciting contributions to be used for the publication of such literature. A State constitutionally may, by general and nondiscriminatory legislation, regulate the time, place and manner of soliciting upon its streets, and of holding meetings thereon, and may in other respects safeguard the peace, good order and comfort of the community.    The statute here, however, is not such a regulation.  If a certificate is issued, solicitation is permitted without other restriction; but if a certificate is denied, solicitation is altogether prohibited. 5. The fact that arbitrary or capricious action by the licensing officer is subject to judicial review cannot validate the statute.  A previous restraint by judicial decision after trial is as obnoxious under the Constitution as restraint by administrative action.  P.   310 U. S. 306 . 6. The common law offense of breach of the peace may be committed not only by acts of violence, but also by acts and words likely to produce violence in others.  P.   310 U. S. 308 . 7. Defendant, while on a public street endeavoring to interest passerby in the purchase of publications, or in making contributions, in the interest of what he believed to be true religion, induced individuals to listen to the playing of a phonograph record describing the publications.  The record contained a verbal attack upon the religious denomination of which the listeners were members, provoking their indignation and a desire on their part to strike the defendant, who thereupon picked up his books and phonograph and went on his way.  There was no showing that defendant's deportment was noisy, truculent, overbearing, or offensive; nor was it claimed that he intended to insult or affront the listeners by playing the record; nor was it shown that the sound of the phonograph disturbed persons living nearby, drew a crowd, or impeded traffic. Held,  that defendant's conviction of the common law offense of breach of the peace was violative of constitutional guarantees of religious liberty and freedom of speech.  Pp.   310 U. S. 307   et seq. 126 Conn. 1; 8 A.2d 533, reversed. APPEAL from, and certiorari (309 U.S. 626) to review, a judgment which sustained the conviction of all the defendants on one count of an information and the conviction of one of the defendants on another count.  The convictions were challenged as denying the constitutional rights of the defendants. "

New Hampshire No. 502 Argued March 7, 1941 Decided March 31, 1941 312 U.S. 569 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
 Syllabus   1. Civil liberties, as guaranteed by the Constitution, imply the existence of an organized society maintaining public order, without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestrained abuses.  P.   312 U. S. 574 . 2. The authority of a municipality to impose regulations in order to assure the safety and convenience of the people in the use of public highways has never been regarded as inconsistent with civil liberties, but rather as one of the means of safeguarding the good order upon which they ultimately depend.  P.   312 U. S. 574 .  3. As regulation of the use of the streets for parades and processions is a traditional exercise of control by local government, the question in a particular case is whether that control is exerted so as not to deny or unwarrantedly abridge the right of assembly and the opportunities for the communication of thought and the discussion of public questions immemorially associated with resort to public places.  P.   312 U. S. 574 . 4. A state law providing that no parade or procession upon any public street shall be permitted unless a special license therefor shall first be obtained from the selectmen of the town, or from a licensing committee for the city, and subjecting any violator to a fine,  held  constitutional, in view of its construction by the state supreme court, as applied to members of the band of ""Jehovah's Witnesses,"" who marched in groups of from fifteen to twenty members each, in close single files, along the sidewalks in the business district of a populous city, each marcher carrying a sign or placard with ""informational"" inscriptions.  P.   312 U.S. 575 . 5. In exercise of its power to license parades on city streets, the State may charge a license fee reasonably adjusted to the occasion, for meeting administrative and police expenses.  P.   312 U.

 Syllabus   1. In determining whether punishment for an out-of-court publication concerning a pending case, as a contempt, is consistent with guaranties of the Federal Constitution, the problem in the case of a judgment based upon a particularized statutory declaration of the policy of a State is different from that where the judgment is based upon a common law concept of a general nature.  P.   314 U. S. 260 . 2. The ""clear and present danger"" cases, decided by this Court, indicate that the substantive evil likely to result must be extremely serious, and the degree of imminence extremely high, before utterances can be punished.  P.   314 U. S. 263 . 3. The ""clear and present danger"" cases do not mark the farthest constitutional boundaries of protected expression; nor do they more than recognize a minimum compulsion of the Bill of Rights.  P.   314 U. S. 263 . 4. The freedom of speech and of the press secured by the First Amendment against abridgment by the United States is similarly secured to all persons by the Fourteenth against abridgment by a State.  P.   314 U. S. 263 , n. 6. 5. The First Amendment's prohibition of ""any law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press"" must be given the broadest scope that can be countenanced in an orderly society.  P.   314 U. S. 265 . 6. The First Amendment cannot be taken as approving all practices in respect to punishment for contempt which prevailed in England at the time of its ratification.  P.   314 U. S. 265 . 7. The ""inherent tendency"" or ""reasonable tendency"" of an out-of-court publication to cause disrespect for the judiciary or interfere with the orderly administration of justice in a pending case is not sufficient to establish punishable contempt.  P.   314 U. S. 272 . 8. Upon the facts of this case,  held  that convictions of a newspaper publisher and editor for contempt, based on the publication of editorials commenting upon cases pending in a state court, were violative   of constitutional rights of freedom of speech and of the press.  P.   314 U. S. 271 . 9. The conviction of a labor leader for contempt of  state court, based upon his publication in the press of a telegram which he had sent to the Secretary of Labor, in which he criticized the decision of a judge in a case involving a labor dispute and indicated that enforcement of the decree would result in a strike,  held  violative of constitutional rights of freedom of speech and of the press.  P.   314 U. S. 275 . 14 al.2d 464, 94 P.2d 983; 15 Gal.2d 99, 98 P.2d 1029, reversed. CERTIORARI, 309 U.S. 649,   309 U.

 Syllabus   1. Members of a labor union of drivers engaged in the distribution of baked goods, in an endeavor to induce peddlers to work but six days a week and to hire an unemployed union member one day a week, peacefully picketed bakeries from which the peddler obtained their goods, and places of business of the peddlers' customers, carrying placards with the peddlers' names and a true statement of the union's grievance.

That part of c. 378, § 2, of the Public Law of New Hampshire which forbids under penalty that any person shall address ""any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any other person who is lawfully in any street or other public place,"" or ""call him by any offensive or derisive name,"" was construed by the Supreme Court of the State, in this case and before this case arose, as limited to the use in a public place of words directly tending to cause a breach of the peace by provoking the person addressed to acts of violence. Held: (1) That, so construed, it is sufficiently definite and specific to comply with requirements of due process of law.  P.   315 U. S. 573 . (2) That, as applied to a person who, on a public street, addressed another as a ""damned Fascist"" and a ""damned racketeer,"" it does not substantially or unreasonably impinge upon freedom of speech.  P.   315 U.S. 574 . (3) The refusal of the state court to admit evidence offered by the defendant tending to prove provocation and evidence bearing on the truth or falsity of the utterances charged is open to no constitutional objection.  P.   315 U.S. 574 . 2. The Court notices judicially that the appellations ""damned racketeer"" and ""damned Fascist"" are epithets likely to provoke the average person to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace.

The action of a State in making it compulsory for children in the public schools to salute the flag and pledge allegiance -- by extending the right arm, palm upward, and declaring, ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands; one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"" -- violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

So  held  as applied to children who were expelled for refusal to comply, and whose absence thereby became ""unlawful,"" subjecting them and their parents or guardians to punishment. 3.

 Syllabus   1. A municipal ordinance which, as construed and applied, requires religious colporteurs to pay a license tax as a condition to the pursuit of their activities, is invalid under the Federal Constitution as a denial of freedom of speech, press and religion.  Pp.   319 U. S. 108 -110. 2. The mere fact that the religious literature is ""sold"", rather than ""donated"" does not transform the activities of the colporteur into a commercial enterprise.  P.   319 U. S. 111 . 3. Upon the record in these cases, it cannot be said that ""Jehovah's Witnesses"" were engaged in a commercial, rather than in a religious, venture.  P.   319 U. S. 111 . 4. A State may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the Federal Constitution.  P.   319 U. S. 113 . 5. The flat license tax here involved restrains in advance the Constitutional liberties of press and religion, and inevitably tends to suppress their exercise.  P.   319 U. S. 114 . 6. That the ordinance is ""nondiscriminatory,"" in that it applies also to peddlers of wares and merchandise, is immaterial.  The liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment are in a preferred position.  P.   319 U. S. 115 . 7. Since the privilege in question is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and exists independently of state authority, the inquiry as to whether the State has given something for which it can ask a return is irrelevant.  P.   319 U. S. 115 . 8. A community may not suppress, or the State tax, the dissemination of views because they are unpopular, annoying, or distasteful.  P.   319 U. S. 116 .  9. The assumption that the ordinance has been construed to apply only to solicitation from house to house cannot sustain it, since it is not narrowly drawn to prevent or control abuses or evil arising from that particular type of activity.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   1. Where the charge of the trial court in a criminal prosecution for violation of the Act of June 8, 1938, as amended by the Act of August 7, 1939, authorized the jury to return a verdict of guilty if it found that the defendant had willfully failed to disclose activities which were wholly on his own behalf, the conviction can be sustained only if the failure to disclose such activities was a criminal offense, even though the evidence might warrant a finding that all of the defendant's activities were in fact in behalf of foreign principals.  P.   318 U. S. 240 . 2. The Act of June 8, 1938, as amended by the Act of August 7, 1939,  held  not to require, or authorize the Secretary of State to require, registrants to make any statement of their activities other than those in which they have engaged ""as agent"" of a foreign principal.  P.   318 U. S. 243 . 3. The unambiguous words of a criminal statute are not to be altered by judicial construction so as to punish one not otherwise within its reach, however deserving of punishment his conduct may seem.  P.   318 U. S. 243 . 4. The application of the amendatory Act of April 29, 1942, to impose upon the defendant in this case a duty which the words of the prior Act plainly exclude cannot be justified by denominating the amendatory legislation as clarifying or declaratory.  P.   318 U. S. 247 . 5. The defendant's right to a fair trial in this case was prejudiced by the conduct of the prosecutor, who, in his closing remarks to the jury, indulged in an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, and the only purpose and effect of which could have been to arouse passion and prejudice.  Such remarks should have been stopped by the trial judge  sua sponte.   P.   318 U. S. 247 . 6. It is as much the duty of the prosecutor to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.  P.   318 U. S. 248 .

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Upon an indictment charging use of the mails to defraud, and conspiracy so to do, respondents were convicted in the District Court.  The indictment charged a scheme to defraud through representations -- involving respondents' religious doctrines or beliefs -- which were alleged to be false and known by the respondents to be false.  Holding that the District Court had restricted the jury to the issue of respondents' good faith and that this was error, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and granted a new trial. Held: 1. The only issue submitted to the jury by the District Court was whether respondents believed the representations to be true.  P.   322 U.S. 84 . 2. Respondents did not acquiesce in the withdrawal from the jury of the issue of the truth of their religious doctrines or beliefs, and are not barred by the rule of  Johnson v. United States,   318 U. S. 189 , from reasserting here that no part of the indictment should have been submitted to the jury.  P.   322 U. S. 85 . 3. The District Court properly withheld from the jury all questions concerning the truth or falsity of respondents' religious beliefs or doctrines.  This course was required by the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom.  P.   322 U. S. 86 . The preferred position given freedom of religion by the First Amendment is not limited to any particular religious group or to any particular type of religion but applies to all.  P.   322 U. S. 87 . 4. Respondents may urge in support of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals points which that court reserved, but, since these were not fully presented here either in the briefs or oral argument, they may more appropriately be considered by that court upon remand.  P.   322 U. S. 88 . 138 F.2d 540 reversed. Certiorari, 320 U.S. 733, to review the reversal of convictions for using the mails to defraud and conspiracy. "

 Syllabus   1. A statute of Texas requires labor organizers to register with and procure an organizer's card from a designated state official before soliciting memberships in labor unions.  While a state court order restraining the appellant from violating the statute was in effect, he made a speech before an assemblage of workers.  At the end of his speech, he urged his hearers generally to join a union, and also asked an individual by name to become a member.  Appellant was sentenced to a fine and imprisonment for contempt. Held: (a) Upon the record, the penalty for contempt must be treated as having been imposed in respect of both the general and the specific invitations, and the judgment of contempt must be affirmed as to both or neither.  P.   323 U. S. 528 . On the question whether a restriction could be sustained in respect of the appellant's solicitation of the individual, if considered separately, the Court expresses no opinion. (b) As applied in this case, the statute imposed a previous restraint upon appellant's rights of free speech and free assembly, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution.  P.   323 U. S. 532 . (c) A requirement that one register before making a public speech to enlist support for a lawful movement is incompatible with the guaranties of the First Amendment.  P.   323 U. S. 540 . 2. The task of drawing the line between the freedom of the individual and the power of the State is more delicate than usual where the presumption supporting legislation is balanced by the preferred position of the freedoms secured by the First Amendment.  P.   323 U. S. 529 . 3. Restriction of the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment can be justified only by clear and present danger to the public welfare.  P.   323 U. S. 530 . 4. The rational connection between the remedy provided and the evil to be curbed, which in other contexts might support legislation against attack on due process grounds, will not, in itself, suffice   to sustain a restriction of the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment.  P.   323 U. S. 530 . 5. Freedom of speech and of the press, and the rights a the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances, are cognate rights.  P.   323 U. S. 530 . 6. The First Amendment's safeguards are not inapplicable to business or economic activity.  P.   323 U. S. 531 . 7. State regulation of labor unions, whether aimed at fraud or other abuses, must not infringe constitutional rights of free speech and free assembly.  P.   323 U.

 Syllabus   1. The issue as to the validity of § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act of 1943, providing that, after November 15, 1943, no salary or other compensation shall be paid to certain employees of the Government (specified by name) out of any monies then or thereafter appropriated except for services as jurors or members of the armed forces, unless they were again appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate prior to such date, is not a mere political issue over which Congress has final say, and a challenge to its constitutionality presents a justiciable question to the courts.  P.   328 U. S. 313 . (a) It is not a mere appropriation measure over which Congress has complete control.  P.   328 U. S. 313 . (b) Its purpose was not merely to cut off the employees' compensation through regular disbursing channels, but permanently to bar them from government service, except as jurors or soldiers -- because of what Congress thought of their political beliefs.  P.   328 U. S. 313 . (c) The Constitution did not contemplate that congressional action aimed at three individuals, which stigmatized their reputations and seriously impaired their chances to earn a living, could never be challenged in court.  P.   328 U. S. 314 . 2. Section 304 violates Article I, § 3, cl. 9 of the Constitution, which forbids the enactment of any bill of attainder or  ex post facto  law.  P.   328 U. S. 315 . (a) Legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial, are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.   Cummins v. Missouri ,  4 Wall. 277;  Ex parte Garland ,  4 Wall. 333.  P.   328 U. S. 315 . (b) Section 304 clearly accomplishes the punishment of named individuals without a judicial trial.  P.   328 U. S. 316 .  (c) The fact that the punishment is inflicted through the instrumentality of an Act specifically cutting off the pay of certain named individuals found by Congress to be guilty of disloyalty make it no less effective than if it had been done by an Act which designated the conduct as criminal.  P.   328 U. S. 316 . 104 Ct.Cls. 557, 66 F. Supp. 142, affirmed. The Court of Claims entered judgments in favor of certain government employees for services rendered after November 15, 1943, to whom § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act of 1943, 57 Stat. 431, 450, forbade payment of any compensation after that date from appropriated funds.  104 Ct.Cls. 557, 66 F.

A State can not, consistently with the freedom of religion and the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, impose criminal punishment upon a person engaged in religious activities and distributing religious literature in a village owned by the United States under a Congressional program designed to provide housing for workers engaged in national defense activities, where the village is freely accessible and open to the public and has all the characteristics of a typical American town, even though the punishment is attempted under a state statute making it unlawful for any ""peddler or hawker of goods or merchandise"" willfully to refuse to leave the premises after having been notified to do so by the owner or possessor thereof.  P.   326 U. S. 519 . 2. Neither the Federal Housing Act nor the Housing Authority Regulations indicate a purpose to restrict freedom of religion and of the press within villages such as the one here involved.  P.   326 U. S. 520 . 3. A judgment of an intermediate state court sustaining a state statute challenged as repugnant to the Federal Constitution is reviewable here under § 237(a) of the Judicial Code, where such intermediate court is the highest court of the State in which a decision in the case could be had.

 Syllabus   1. A state can not, consistently with the freedom of religion and the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, impose criminal punishment on a person for distributing religious literature on the sidewalk of a company-owned town contrary to regulations of the town's management, where the town and its shopping district are freely accessible to and freely used by the public in general, even though the punishment is attempted under a state statute making it a crime for anyone to enter or remain on the premises of another after having been warned not to do so.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   1. Under § 3 of the Act of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 752, 28 U.S.C. § 380a, a direct appeal to this Court was taken from a judgment of a district court of three judges denying an injunction in a case involving the constitutionality of a federal statute.  The case was not docketed in this Court until after 60 days from the time the appeal was allowed.  The steps prescribed by Rule 11 of this Court for obtaining a dismissal were not taken by the appellees. Held:   This Court has jurisdiction of the appeal.  Pp.   330 U. S. 84 -86. (a) The provision of 28 U.S.C. § 380a requiring an appeal thereunder to be docketed in this Court within 60 days from the time the appeal is allowed was not intended to vary Rule 11 of this Court, and does not constitute a limitation on the power of this Court to hear this appeal.  Pp.   330 U. S. 85 -86. (b) Rule 47 of this Court requires the same practice for appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 380a that Rule 11 does for other appeals.  P.   330 U. S. 86 . 2. Certain employees of the executive branch of the Federal Government sued for an injunction against the members of the Civil Service Commission to prohibit them from enforcing against such employees § 9(a) of the Hatch Act, 18 U.S.C. Supp. V § 61h, which forbids such employees from taking ""any active part in political management or in political campaigns,"" and also for a declaratory judgment of the unconstitutionality of this section.  They did not allege that they had violated the Act or that they actually were threatened with any disciplinary action, but only that they desire to engage in acts of political management and in political campaigns (specifying the nature of the actions which they wish to take) and are prevented from doing so by fear of dismissal from federal employment. Held:   Their suit does not present a justiciable case or controversy.  Pp.   330 U. S. 86 -91. 3. Another employee of the executive branch of the Federal Government brought a similar suit, alleging that he actually had committed   specific violations of the Act, and that the Commission had charged him with violations and had issued a proposed order for his removal, subject to his right to reply to the charges and to present further evidence in refutation. Held:   His suit presents a justiciable case or controversy.  Pp.   330 U. S. 91 -94. (a) Since the employee admits that he violated the Act and that removal from office is therefore mandatory under the Act, there is no question as to exhaustion of administrative remedies.  P.   330 U. S. 93 . (b) There being no administrative or statutory review for the Commission's order and no prior proceeding pending in the courts, there is no reason why a declaratory judgment action does not lie, even though constitutional issues are involved.  P.   330 U. S. 93 . 4. A person employed as a roller in a United States mint acted outside of working hours as a ward executive committeeman of a political party and was politically active on election day as a worker at the polls and as a paymaster for the services of other workers.  The Civil Service Commission found that he had taken an ""active part in political management or in political campaigns"" in violation of § 9 of the Hatch Act, 18 U.S.C.Supp. V § 61h, and Rule 1 of the Commission, and issued an order for his removal from federal employment. Held:   Such a breach of the Hatch Act and Rule 1 of the Commission can be made the basis for disciplinary action without violating the Constitution.  Pp.   330 U.S. 94 -104. (a) Congress has the power to regulate, within reasonable limits, the political conduct of federal employees, in order to promote efficiency and integrity in the public service.   Ex parte Curtis,   106 U. S. 371 ;  United States v. Wurzbach,   280 U. S. 396 .  Pp.   330 U. S. 96 -103. (b) The fundamental human rights guaranteed by the First, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments are not absolute, and this Court must balance the extent of the guarantee of freedom against a congressional enactment to protect a democratic society against the supposed evil of political partisanship by employees of the Government.  Pp.   330 U. S. 95 -96. (c) The Hatch Act permits full participation by federal employees in political decisions at the ballot box, and forbids only the partisan activity deemed offensive to efficiency.  P.   330 U. S. 99 . (d) It does not restrict public and private expressions on public affairs, personalities, and matters of public interest, not an objective of party action, so long as the government employee does not direct his activities toward party success.  P.   330 U. S. 100 . (e) If political activity by government employees is harmful   to the service, the employees, or people dealing with them, it is hardly less so because it takes place after hours.  P.   330 U. S. 95 . (f) The prohibition of § 9(a) of the Hatch Act applies without discrimination to all employees of the executive branch of the Government, whether industrial or administrative.  P.   330 U. S. 102 . (g) Whatever differences there may be between administrative employees of the Government and industrial workers in its employ are differences in detail for the consideration of Congress, so far as the constitutional power here involved is concerned.  P.   330 U. S. 102 . (h) The determination of the extent to which political activities of government employees shall be regulated lies primarily with Congress, and the courts will interfere only when such regulation passes beyond the generally existing conception of governmental power.  P.   330 U. S. 102 . 5.  Acting as ward executive committeeman of a political party and as a worker at the polls is within the prohibitions of § 9 of the Hatch Act and the Civil Service Rules.  P.   330 U. S. 103 . 56 F. Supp. 621 , affirmed. Certain employees of the executive branch of the Federal Government and a union of such employees sued to enjoin the members of the Civil Service Commission from enforcing the provision of § 9(a) of the Hatch Act, 18 U.S.C. Supp. V § 61h, which forbids such employees to take ""any active part in political management or in political campaigns,"" and for a declaratory judgment holding the Act unconstitutional.  The District Court dismissed the suit.   56 F. Supp. 621 .  A direct appeal to this Court was taken under § 3 of the Act of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 752, 28 U.S.C. § 380a.   Affirmed,  p.   330 U. S. 104 . "

 Syllabus   1. The publication in a newspaper of news articles, which unfairly reported events in a case pending in a state court, and an editorial which vehemently attacked the trial judge (a layman elected for a short term) while a motion for a new trial was pending, did not, in the circumstances of this case, constitute a clear and present danger to the administration of justice, and the conviction of the newspapermen for contempt violated the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Following  Bridges v. California,   314 U. S. 252 , and  Pennekamp v. Florida,   328 U. S. 331 .  Pp.   331 U. S. 368 -370,   331 U. S. 375 -378. 2. The present case is one of the type in which this Court is required to make an independent examination of the facts to determine whether a State has deprived a person of a fundamental right secured by the Constitution.  Pp.   331 U. S. 373 -374. 3. There is no special perquisite of the judiciary which enables it, as distinguished from other institutions of democratic government, to suppress, edit, or censor reports of occurrences in judicial proceedings.  P.   331 U. S. 374 . 4. One reporting the news of a judicial trial may not be held for contempt because he missed the essential point in the trial or failed to summarize the issues to accord with the views of the trial judge.  P.   331 U. S. 375 . 5. The vehemence of the language used in a publication concerning a pending case is not alone the measure of the power to punish for contempt; the threat to the administration of justice must be imminent.  P.   331 U. S. 376 . 6. The law of contempt is not designed for the protection of judges who may be sensitive to the winds of public opinion.  P.   331 U. S. 376 . 7. Although the nature of a case may be relevant in determining whether the clear and present danger test is satisfied, the rule of the  Bridges  and  Pennekamp  cases is fashioned to serve the needs of all litigation, not merely particular types of pending cases.  P.   331 U. S. 378 . 149 Tex.Cr. ___, 193 S.W.2d 178, reversed.

 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS
 Syllabus   1. Section 506(a)(1) of the Communications Act, making it a crime, by the use or threat of use of force, violence, intimidation, or duress, to coerce, compel or constrain or attempt to coerce, compel or constrain a radio broadcasting licensee to employ or agree to employ, in connection with the conduct of the licensee's broadcasting business, any person or persons ""in excess of the number of employees needed by such licensee to perform actual services,"" is not so vague, indefinite or uncertain as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   332 U. S. 5 -8. (a) This question was properly presented to this Court for a decision on an appeal by the Government under the Criminal Appeals Act from a decision of a District Court dismissing, on the sole ground that the section was unconstitutional, an information charging a violation in substantially the statutory language.  Pp.   332 U. S. 5 -6. (b) The contention that persons of ordinary intelligence would be unable to know when their compulsive actions would force a person against his will to hire employees he did not need cannot be sustained.  Pp.   332 U. S. 6 -7. (c) When measured by common understanding and practices, the language of the statute provides an adequate warning as to what conduct falls under its ban, and marks boundaries sufficiently distinct for judges and juries fairly to administer the law in accordance with the will of Congress, and the Constitution requires no more.  Pp.   332 U. S. 7 -8.  2. It does not contravene the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by denying equal protection of the laws to radio broadcasting employees as a class -- even though it provides no punishment for employers for violating the policy and leaves other classes of employees free to engage in the practices forbidden to radio workers.  Pp.   332 U. S. 8 -9. (a) This question was properly presented to this Court for a decision on an appeal by the Government under the Criminal Appeals Act from a decision of the District Court dismissing an information on the sole ground that the statute is unconstitutional as written.  P.   332 U. S. 8 . (b) It is not within the province of this Court to say that, because Congress has prohibited some practices within its power to prohibit, it must prohibit all within its power.  Pp.   332 U. S. 8 -9. 3. On its face, the statute does not contravene the First Amendment by abridging freedom of speech; but, since the statute does not mention picketing, and it is uncertain on the record in this case whether it would have been applied so as to prohibit peaceful picketing, the question whether such an application would violate the First Amendment is not before this Court in a form appropriate for decision.  Pp.   332 U. S. 9 -12. 4. On its face, the statute does not violate the provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment prohibiting slavery and involuntary servitude; but no decision is made on the question whether some possible application of it to particular persons in particular sets of circumstances would violate the Thirteenth Amendment, since questions of that kind are not presented by the record in this case in a form appropriate for decision by this Court.  Pp.   332 U. S. 12 -13. 5. The Criminal Appeals Act does not require this Court to pass on constitutional questions prematurely decided by a district court's dismissal of an information which had not been tested by a motion to strike or for a bill of particulars.  P.   332 U. S. 10 . 68 F. Supp. 845 , reversed and remanded. The District Court dismissed a criminal information charging respondent with violation of § 506(a)(1) of the Communications Act on the ground that the section was unconstitutional.   68 F.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   1. Where the Postmaster General has issued a fraud order under 39 U.S.C. §§ 259, 732, and later concludes that it is broader than necessary to protect the public, he has power to modify the order so as to make it less inclusive -- even though there be pending in this Court at the time a review of a judgment of a federal court of appeals affirming a judgment of a district court enjoining enforcement of the order.  Pp.   333 U. S. 183 -185. 2. The evidence in this case was sufficient to support the finding of the Postmaster General that respondents' advertisements of a so-called ""puzzle contest"" had been deliberately contrived to divert readers' attention from material, but adroitly obscured facts, and that respondents were conducting a scheme to obtain money through the mails by means of false and fraudulent representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. §§ 259, 732.  Pp.   333 U. S. 185 -189. 3. The fraud order statutes, 39 U.S.C. §§ 259, 732, as interpreted and applied by the Postmaster General in this case, are constitutional.   Public Clearing House v.

 Syllabus   With the permission of a board of education, granted under its general supervisory powers over the use of public school buildings, religious teachers, employed subject to the approval and supervision of the superintendent of schools by a private religious group including representatives of the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish faiths, gave religious instruction in public school buildings once each week.  Pupils whose parents so requested were excused from their secular classes during the periods of religious instruction and were required to attend the religious classes; but other pupils were not released from their public school duties, which were compulsory under state law.  A resident and taxpayer of the school district whose child was enrolled in the public schools sued in a state court for a writ of mandamus requiring the board of education to terminate this practice. Held: 1. A judgment of the State Supreme Court sustaining denial of the writ of mandamus on the ground that the state statutes granted the board of education authority to establish such a program drew into question ""the validity of a statute"" of the State within the meaning of § 237 of the Judicial Code, and was appealable to this Court.  P.   333 U. S. 206 . 2. As a resident and taxpayer of the school district and the parent of a child required by state law to attend the school, appellant had standing to maintain the suit.  P.   333 U. S. 206 . 3. Both state courts having ruled expressly on appellant's claim that the state program violated the Federal Constitution, a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that appellant failed properly to present that question in the State Supreme Court cannot be sustained.  P.   333 U. S. 207 . 4. This utilization of the State's tax supported public school system and its machinery for compulsory public school attendance to enable sectarian groups to give religious instruction to public school pupils in public school buildings violates the First Amendment of the Constitution, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   333 U. S. 209 -212. 396 Ill. 14, 71 N.E.2d 161, reversed.  The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed a denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus requiring a board of education to terminate the giving of religious instruction by private teachers in the public schools.  396 Ill. 14, 71 N.E.2d 161.

 Syllabus   A city ordinance forbidding the use of sound amplification devices in public places except with the permission of the Chief of Police and prescribing no standards for the exercise of his discretion is unconstitutional on its face, since it establishes a previous restraint on the right of free speech in violation of the First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp.   334 U. S. 558 -562. 297 N.Y. 659, 76 N.E.2d 323, reversed. Appellant was convicted of violating a city ordinance forbidding the use of sound amplification devices except with the permission of the Chief of Police.  The County Court and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed.  297 N.Y. 659, 76 N.E.2d 323.  On appeal to this Court,  reversed,  p.   334 U. S. 562 . Opinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, announced by MR. JUSTICE BLACK. This case presents the question of the validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of a penal ordinance of the City of Lockport, New York, which forbids the use of sound amplification devices except with permission of the Chief of Police. [ Footnote 1 ]  Appellant is a minister of the religious sect known as Jehovah's Witnesses.  He obtained from the Chief of Police permission to use sound equipment, mounted atop his car, to amplify lectures on religious subjects.  The lectures were given at a fixed place in a public park on designated Sundays.  When this permit expired, he applied for another one, but was refused on the ground that complaints had been made.  Appellant nevertheless used his equipment as planned on four occasions, but without a permit.  He was tried in Police Court for violations of the ordinance.  It was undisputed that he used his equipment to amplify speeches in the park, and that they were on religious subjects.  Some witnesses testified that they were annoyed by the sound, though not by the content of the addresses; others were not disturbed by either.  The court upheld the ordinance against the contention that it violated appellant's rights of freedom of speech, assembly, and worship under the Federal Constitution.  Fines and jail sentences were imposed.  His convictions were affirmed without opinion by the County Court for Niagara County and by the New York Court of Appeals, 297 N.Y. 659, 76 N.E.2d 323.  The case is here on appeal. We hold that § 3 of this ordinance is unconstitutional on its face, for it establishes a previous restraint on the   right of free speech in violation of the First Amendment which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against State action.  To use a loudspeaker or amplifier, one has to get a permit from the Chief of Police.  There are no standards prescribed for the exercise of his discretion.  The statute is not narrowly drawn to regulate the hours or places of use of loudspeakers, or the volume of sound (the decibels) to which they must be adjusted.  The ordinance therefore has all the vices of the ones which we struck down in  Cantwell v. Connecticut,   310 U. S. 296 ;  Lovell v. Griffin,   303 U. S. 444 , and  Hague v. CIO,   307 U. S. 496 . In the  Cantwell  case, a license had to be obtained in order to distribute religious literature.  What was religious was left to the discretion of a public official.  We held that judicial review to rectify abuses in the licensing system did not save the ordinance from condemnation on the grounds of previous restraint.   Lovell v. Griffin, supra,  held void on its face an ordinance requiring a license for the distribution of literature.  That ordinance, like the present one, was dressed in the garb of the control of a ""nuisance.""  But the Court made short shrift of the argument, saying that approval of the licensing system would institute censorship ""in its baldest form.""  In  Hague v. CIO, supra,  we struck down a city ordinance which required a license from a local official for a public assembly on the streets or highways or in the public parks or public buildings.  The official was empowered to refuse the permit if, in his opinion, the refusal would prevent ""riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage.""  We held that the ordinance was void on its face because it could be made ""the instrument of arbitrary suppression of free expression of views on national affairs.""  307 U.S. p.   307 U. S. 516 . The present ordinance has the same defects.  The right to be heard is placed in the uncontrolled discretion of the   Chief of Police.  He stands athwart the channels of communication as an obstruction which can be removed only after criminal trial and conviction and lengthy appeal.  A more effective previous restraint is difficult to imagine.  Unless we are to retreat from the firm positions we have taken in the past, we must give freedom of speech in this case the same preferred treatment that we gave freedom of religion in the  Cantwell  case, freedom of the press in the  Griffin  case, and freedom of speech and assembly in the  Hague  case. [ Footnote 2 ] Loudspeakers are today indispensable instruments of effective public speech.  The sound truck has become an accepted method of political campaigning.  It is the way people are reached.  Must a candidate for governor or the Congress depend on the whim or caprice of the Chief of Police in order to use his sound truck for campaigning?    Must he prove to the satisfaction of that official that his noise will not be annoying to people? The present ordinance would be a dangerous weapon if it were allowed to get a hold on our public life.  Noise can be regulated by regulating decibels.  The hours and place of public discussion can be controlled.  But to allow the police to bar the use of loudspeakers because their use can be abused is like barring radio receivers because they too make a noise.  The police need not be given the power to deny a man the use of his radio in order to protect a neighbor against sleepless nights.  The same is true here. Any abuses which loudspeakers create can be controlled by narrowly drawn statutes.  When a city allows an official to ban them in his uncontrolled discretion, it sanctions a device for suppression of free communication of ideas.  In this case, a permit is denied because some persons were said to have found the sound annoying.  In the next one, a permit may be denied because some people find the ideas annoying.  Annoyance at ideas can be cloaked in annoyance at sound.  The power of censorship inherent in this type of ordinance reveals its vice. Courts must balance the various community interests in passing on the constitutionality of local regulations of the character involved here.  But, in that process, they should be mindful to keep the freedoms of the First Amendment in a preferred position.   See Marsh v. Alabama,   326 U. S. 501 ,   326 U. S. 509 . Reversed. [ Footnote 1 ] The ordinance, insofar as pertinent, reads as follows: ""Section 2.  Radio devices, etc.  It shall be unlawful for any person to maintain and operate in any building, or on any premises or on any automobile, motor truck or other motor vehicle, any radio device, mechanical device, or loud speaker or any device of any kind whereby the sound therefrom is cast directly upon the streets and public places and where such device is maintained for advertising purposes or for the purpose of attracting the attention of the passing public, or which is so placed and operated that the sounds coming therefrom can be heard to the annoyance or inconvenience of travelers upon any street or public places or of persons in neighboring premises."" ""Section 3.  Exception.  Public dissemination, through radio loudspeakers, of items of news and matters of public concern and athletic activities shall not be deemed a violation of this section provided that the same be done under permission obtained from the Chief of Police."" Appellant's conduct was regarded throughout as falling within the types of activity enumerated in § 3.  We take the ordinance as construed by the State courts. [ Footnote 2 ] Cox v. New Hampshire,   312 U. S. 569 ,   312 U. S. 577 -578, did not depart from the rule of these earlier cases, but reemphasized the vice of the type of ordinance we have here.   Davis v. Massachusetts,   167 U. S. 43 , was distinguished in the  Hague  case, 307 U.S. pp.   307 U. S. 514 -516, which likewise involved an ordinance regulating the use of public streets and parks.  It was there said, ""We have no occasion to determine whether, on the facts disclosed, the  Davis  case was rightly decided, but we cannot agree that it rules the instant case.  Wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.  Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens.  The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but it must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied."" We adhere to that view.  Though the statement was that of only three Justices, it plainly indicated the route the majority followed, who, on the merits, did not consider the  Davis  case to be controlling."

 Syllabus   In a meeting which attracted considerable public attention, petitioner addressed a large audience in an auditorium outside of which was an angry and turbulent crowd protesting against the meeting.  He condemned the conduct of the crowd outside and vigorously criticized various political and racial groups.  Notwithstanding efforts of a cordon of police to maintain order, there were several disturbances in the crowd.  Petitioner was charged with violation of an ordinance forbidding any ""breach of the peace,"" and the trial court instructed the jury that any misbehavior which ""stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance"" violates the ordinance.  Petitioner did not except to that instruction, but he did maintain at all times that, as applied to his conduct, the ordinance violated his right of free speech under the Federal Constitution.  He was convicted on a general verdict, and his conviction was affirmed by an intermediate appellate court and by the Supreme Court of the State. Held: 1. As construed by the trial court and applied to petitioner, the ordinance violates the right of free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.

"" The State Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, indicating in its opinion that, as to one charged with violation of the italicized portion, the statute requires that the accused shall have aided the assemblage with the intention that force and violence would be used to prevent a person from working. Held: 1.

 FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 Syllabus   Section 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, which imposes certain restrictions on, and denies the benefits of certain provisions of the National Labor Relations Act to, any labor organization the officers of which have not filed with the National Labor Relations Board the so-called ""non-Commmist"" affidavits prescribed by § 9(h), is valid under the Federal Constitution.  Pp.   339 U. S. 385 -415. 1. One of the purposes of the Labor Management Relations Act was to remove the obstructions to the free flow of commerce resulting from ""political strikes"" instigated by Communists who had infiltrated the management of labor organizations and were subordinating legitimate trade union objectives to obstructive strikes when dictated by Communist Party leaders, often in support of the policies of a foreign government.  Pp.   339 U. S. 387 -389. 2. Section 9(h) does not merely withhold from noncomplying unions benefits granted by the Government; it also imposes on them a number of restrictions which would not exist if the National Labor Relations Act had not been enacted.  However, it does not prohibit persons who do not sign the prescribed affidavit from holding union office.  Pp.   339 U. S. 389 -390. 3. The remedy provided by § 9(h) bears reasonable relation to the evil which it was designed to reach, since Congress might reasonably find that Communists, unlike members of other political parties, and persons who believe in the overthrow of the Government by force, unlike persons of other beliefs, represent a continuing danger of disruptive political strikes when they hold positions of union leadership.  Pp.   339 U. S. 390 -393.  4. Section 9(h) is designed to protect the public not against what Communists and others identified therein advocate or believe, but against what Congress has concluded they have done and are likely to do again, and the probable effects of the statute upon the free exercise of the right of speech and assembly must be weighed against the congressional determination that political strikes are evils of conduct which cause substantial harm to interstate commerce, and that Communists and others identified by § 9(h) pose continuing threats to that public interest when in positions of union leadership.  Pp.   339 U. S. 393 -400. 5. In view of the complexity of the problem of political strikes and how to deal with their leaders, the public interest in the good faith exercise of the great powers entrusted by Congress to labor bargaining representatives under the National Labor Relations Act, the fact that § 9(h) touches only a relatively few persons who combine certain political affiliations or beliefs with the occupancy of positions of great power over the economy of the country, and the fact that injury to interstate commerce would be an accomplished fact before any sanctions could be applied, the legislative judgment that interstate commerce must be protected from a continuing threat of political strikes is a permissible one in this case.  Pp.   339 U. S. 400 -406. 6. The belief identified in § 9(h) is a belief in the objective of overthrow by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods of the Government of the United States as it now exists under the Constitution and laws thereof.  The sole effect of the statute upon one who holds such beliefs is that he may be forced to relinquish his position as a union leader.  So construed, in the light of the circumstances surrounding the problem, § 9(h) does not unduly infringe freedoms protected by the First Amendment.  Pp.   339 U. S. 406 -412. 7. Section 9(h) is not unconstitutionally vague; it does not violate the prohibition of Article I, § 9 of the Constitution against bills of attainder or  ex post facto  laws, and it does not require a ""test oath"" contrary to the provision of Article VI that ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.""  Pp.   339 U. S. 412 -415. 79 F. Supp. 563 , 170 F.2d 247, affirmed. No. 10. Although the officers of appellant union had not filed with the National Labor Relations Board the affidavit prescribed by § 9(h) of the National Labor   Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 136, 146, 29 U.S.C. (Supp. III) §§ 141, 159(h), appellant, claiming hat the section was unconstitutional, sued to restrain the Board from holding a representation election in a bargaining unit in which appellant was the employee representative, until a hearing was granted to appellant.  The three-judge district court dismissed the complaint.   79 F. Supp. 563 .  On appeal to this Court,  affirmed,  p.   339 U. S. 415 . No. 13. On an unfair labor practice complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board by petitioner unions, the Board found that the employer had violated the National Labor Relations Act in refusing to bargain on the subject of pensions; but the Board postponed the effective date of its order compelling the employer to bargain, pending the unions' compliance with § 9(h).  77 N.L.R.B. 1.  The Court of Appeals sustained the Board's action on both counts.  170 F.2d 247.  This Court denied certiorari on the pension issue, 336 U.S. 960, but granted certiorari on an issue regarding the constitutionality of § 9(h).  335 U.S. 910.   Affirmed,  p.   339 U. S. 415 . "

 Syllabus   Petitioners demanded of an employer that it hire Negroes at one of its grocery stores, as white clerks quit or were transferred, until the proportion of Negro clerks to white clerks approximated the proportion of Negro to white customers, which was then about 50%.  A California state court enjoined petitioners from picketing the employer's stores to enforce this specific demand for selective hiring on a racial basis.  For violation of the injunction, petitioners were found guilty of contempt and were sentenced to fine and imprisonment.  The policy of California is against discrimination on the basis of color. Held:   the injunction did not violate petitioners' right of freedom of speech as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   339 U. S. 461 -469. 1. The Constitution does not demand that the element of communication in picketing prevail over the mischief furthered by its use to compel employment on the basis of racial discrimination contrary to the State's policy.  Pp.   339 U. S. 463 -464. 2. Industrial picketing is something more than free speech, since it involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very presence of a picket line may induce action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which are being disseminated.  Pp.   339 U. S. 464 -465. 3. The Due Process Clause cannot be construed as precluding California from securing respect for its policy against involuntary employment on racial lines by prohibiting systematic picketing that would subvert such policy.  Pp.   339 U. S. 465 -466. 4. The fact that the policy of the State is expressed by its courts, rather than by its legislature, is immaterial so far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned.  Pp.   339 U. S. 466 -469. 5. A State may direct its law against what it deems the evil as it actually exists without covering the whole field of possible abuses, and it may do so though the forbidden act does not differ in kind from those that are allowed.  P.   339 U. S. 468 . 32 Cal. 2d 850 , 198 P.2d 885, affirmed.  The case is stated in the first three paragraphs of the opinion.  The judgment below is  affirmed,  p.   339 U.S. 469 ."

 Syllabus   In a state whose public policy is that employers shall not coerce their employees' choice of a bargaining representative, a state court injunction against peaceful picketing by a labor union for the particular purpose of compelling an employer to sign a contract which would coerce his employees' choice of a bargaining representative does not violate the right of free speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.   339 U. S. 533 -541. (a) Since picketing is more than speech, and establishes a  locus in quo  that has far more potential for inducing action than the message the pickets convey, this Court upholds a state's restraint of acts and conduct which are an abuse of the right to picket, rather than a means of peaceful and truthful publicity.  Pp.   339 U. S. 536 -537. (b) The picketing of the employer to compel him to coerce his employees' choice of a bargaining representative was unlawful because it was an attempt to induce a transgression of the State's policy against such coercion of employees.  Pp.   339 U. S. 538 -539. (c)  American Federation of Labor v. Swing,   312 U. S. 321 , distinguished;  Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co.,   336 U. S. 490 , followed.  Pp.   339 U.

 OF HARFORD COUNTY, MARYLAND
 Syllabus   Appellants' applications to a City Council for permits to use a city park for Bible talks were denied, for no apparent reason except the Council's dislike for appellants and disagreement with their views.  For attempting to hold public meetings and make speeches in the park without permits, they were convicted on charges of disorderly conduct, although there was no evidence of disorder, threat of violence or riot, and they had conducted themselves in a manner beyond reproach.  There was no ordinance prohibiting or regulating the use of the park, and there were no established standards for the granting of permits; but permits customarily had been granted for similar purposes, including meetings of religious and fraternal organizations. Held:   Appellants were denied equal protection of the laws, in the exercise of freedom of speech and religion, contrary to the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   340 U. S. 269 -273. (a) The right to equal protection of the laws, in the exercise of those freedoms of speech and religion protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, has a firmer foundation than the whims or personal opinions of a local governing body.  P.   340 U. S. 272 . (b) A contention that state and city officials should have the power to exclude religious groups, as such, from the use of public parks was no justification when permits had always been issued for the use of the park by religious organizations.  Pp.   340 U. S. 272 -273. (c) A contention that the park was designated as a sanctuary for peace and quiet was no justification when its use for patriotic celebrations by fraternal organizations was permitted.  P.   340 U. S. 273 . (d) The lack of standards in the license-issuing ""practice"" renders that ""practice"" a prior restraint in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the completely arbitrary and discriminatory refusal to grant the permits was a denial of equal protection.  P.   340 U. S. 273 .  (e) Since the convictions were based upon the lack of permits which were denied unconstitutionally, the convictions cannot stand.  P.   340 U. S. 273 .  ___ Md. ___, 71 A.2d 9, reversed. For attempts to hold religious meetings in a public park without permits, appellants were convicted of disorderly conduct under Flack's Md.Ann. Code, 1939 (1947 Supp.), Art. 27, §131.  The Maryland Court of Appeals declined to review their convictions.  ___ Md. ___, 71 A.2d 9.  On appeal to this Court,  reversed,  p.   340 U. S. 273 ."

 Syllabus   1. A city ordinance which prescribes no appropriate standard for administrative action and gives an administrative official discretionary power to control in advance the right of citizens to speak on religious matters on the city streets is invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   340 U. S. 290 -295. 2. In 1946, appellant obtained from the city Police Commissioner a permit to hold religious meetings on the streets of New York City during that year only.  It was revoked on evidence that he had ridiculed and denounced other religious beliefs, in violation of a criminal provision of the ordinance under which the permit was issued.  The ordinance contained no provision for revocation of such permits, and no standard to guide administrative actions in granting or denying permits.  In 1948, appellant's application for a similar permit was denied, and he was convicted for holding a religious meeting on the streets without a permit. Held:   The conviction is reversed.  Pp.   340 U. S. 290 -295. 300 N.Y. 273, 90 N.E.2d 455, reversed. Appellant was convicted for holding a religious meeting on the city streets without a permit in violation of Administrative Code of N.

 Syllabus   Petitioner made an inflammatory speech to a mixed crowd of 75 or 80 Negroes and white people on a city street.  He made derogatory remarks about President Truman, the American Legion, and local political officials, endeavored to arouse the Negroes against the whites, and urged that Negroes rise up in arms and fight for equal rights.  The crowd, which blocked the sidewalk and overflowed into the street, became restless; its feelings for and against the speaker were rising, and there was at least one threat of violence.  After observing the situation for some time without interference, police officers, in order to prevent a fight, thrice requested petitioner to get off the box and stop speaking.  After his third refusal, and after he had been speaking over 30 minutes, they arrested him, and he was convicted of violating § 722 of the Penal Code of New York, which, in effect, forbids incitement of a breach of the peace.  The conviction was affirmed by two New York courts on review. Held:   The conviction is sustained against a claim that it violated petitioner's right of free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   340 U. S. 316 -321. (a) Petitioner was neither arrested nor convicted for the making or the content of his speech, but for the reaction which it actually engendered.  Pp.   340 U. S. 319 -320. (b) The police cannot be used as an instrument for the suppression of unpopular views; but, when a speaker passes the bounds of argument or persuasion and undertakes incitement to riot, the police are not powerless to prevent a breach of the peace.

The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) is a ""national or international labor organization"" within the meaning of § 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, and the National Labor Relations Board could not proceed against an employer at the instance of a union affiliated with CIO when the officers of CIO had not filed the non-Communist affidavits required by that section, although the affiliated union's own officers had filed such affidavits.  Pp.   341 U. S. 323 -325. 2. When a court of appeals is petitioned to decree enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board requiring an employer to bargain with a union and the facts regarding compliance with § 9(h) are not in dispute, the employer is entitled to a judicial review of the legal question whether there has been compliance with § 9(h).  Pp.   341 U. S. 325 -326. 184 F.2d 98 affirmed. The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board requiring an employer to bargain with a union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations because the officers of the latter had not filed the non-Communist affidavits required by § 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 146, 29 U.S.C. (Supp. III) § 159(h), 184 F.2d 98.  This Court granted certiorari. 340 U.S. 927.   Affirmed,  p.   341 U. S. 326 . "

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent sued petitioners in the Federal District Court for damages under 8 U.S.C. §§ 43 and 47(3), alleging that, in connection with an investigation by a committee of the California Legislature, he had been deprived of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.  Petitioners are the committee and the members thereof, all of whom are members of the legislature. Held:   From the allegations of the complaint, it appears that petitioners were acting in a field where legislators traditionally have power to act; and 8 U.S.C. §§ 43 and 47 (3) do not create civil liability for such conduct.  Pp.   341 U. S. 369 -379. (a) The privilege of legislators to be free from arrest or civil process for what they do or say in legislative proceedings has been carefully preserved in the formation of our State and National Governments.  Pp.   341 U. S. 372 -375. (b) By 8 U.S.C. §§43 and 47(3), Congress did not intend to limit this privilege by subjecting legislators to civil liability for acts done within the sphere of legislative activity.  P.   341 U. S. 376 . (c) The privilege is not destroyed by a claim that the motives of the legislators were improper.  P.   341 U. S. 377 . (d) In order to find that a legislative committee's investigation has exceeded the bounds of legislative power, it must be obvious that there was a usurpation of functions exclusively vested in the Judiciary or the Executive.  P.   341 U. S. 378 . (e) Legislative privilege deserves greater respect in a case in which the defendants are members of the legislature than where an official acting on behalf of the legislature is sued or where the legislature seeks the affirmative aid of the courts to assert a privilege.  P.   341 U. S. 379 . 183 F.2d 121, reversed. In an action brought by respondent against petitioners under 8 U.S.C. §§ 43 and 47(3), the District Court dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  183 F.2d 121.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 903.   Reversed,  p.   341 U. S. 379 . "

 Syllabus   1. As construed and applied in this case, §§ 2(a)(1), 2(a)(3) and 3 of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, making it a crime for any person knowingly or willfully to advocate the overthrow or destruction of the Government of the United States by force or violence, to organize or help to organize any group which does so, or to conspire to do so, do not violate the First Amendment or other provisions of the Bill of Rights and do not violate the First or Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness.  Pp.   341 U. S. 495 -499,   341 U. S. 517 . 2. Petitioners, leaders of the Communist Party in this country, were indicted in a federal district court under § 3 of the Smith Act for willfully and knowingly conspiring (1) to organize as the Communist Party a group of persons to teach and advocate the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) knowingly and willfully to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing and destroying the Government of the United States by force and violence.  The trial judge instructed the jury that they could not convict unless they found that petitioners intended to overthrow the Government ""as speedily as circumstances would permit,"" but that, if they so found, then, as a matter of law, there was sufficient danger of a substantive evil that Congress has a right to prevent to justify application of the statute under the First Amendment.  Petitioners were convicted, and the convictions were sustained by the Court of Appeals.  This Court granted certiorari, limited to the questions:  (1) Whether either § 2 or § 3 of the Smith Act, inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights, and (2) whether either § 2 or § 3, inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First and Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness. Held:   The convictions are affirmed.  Pp.   341 U. S. 495 -499,   341 U. S. 511 -512,   341 U. S. 517 . 183 F.2d 201, affirmed.

Alexandria No. 399 Argued March 7-8, 1951 Decided June 4, 1951 341 U.S. 622 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA
 Syllabus   A so-called ""Green River ordinance"" of a municipality forbids the practice of going in and upon private residences for the purpose of soliciting orders for the sale of goods without prior consent of the owners or occupants.  Appellant, representing a foreign corporation, was engaged in door-to-door soliciting of subscriptions for nationally known magazines and periodicals.  Subscriptions were acknowledged by a card sent from the home office of the corporation, and the publications were delivered by the publishers in interstate commerce through the mails.  Appellant was convicted of a violation of the ordinance solely because he had not obtained the prior consent of the owners or occupants of the residences he solicited. Held: 1. The ordinance is not invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   341 U. S. 629 -633. (a) The ordinance can be characterized as prohibitory of appellant's legitimate business of obtaining subscriptions to periodicals only in the limited sense of subscriptions by house-to-house canvass without invitation.  It leaves open the usual methods of solicitation -- by radio, periodicals, mail and local agencies.  Pp.   341 U. S. 631 -632. (b) The Constitution's protection of property rights does not render a state or city impotent to guard its citizens against the annoyances of life because the regulation may restrict the manner of doing a legitimate business.  Pp.   341 U. S. 632 -633. 2. The ordinance does not so burden or impede interstate commerce as to violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.   341 U. S. 633 -641. (a) The ordinance does not discriminate against interstate business and is a valid local regulation of solicitation.   Hood & Sons v. Du Mond,   336 U. S. 525 , and  Dean Milk Co. v. Madison,   340 U. S. 349 , distinguished.  Pp.   341 U. S. 633 -641. (b) Appellant, as a publishers' representative or in his own right as a door-to-door canvasser, is no more free to violate local regulations to protect privacy than are other solicitors.  Pp.   341 U. S. 637 -641.  (c) When there is a reasonable basis for legislation to protect the social, as distinguished from the economic, welfare of a community, it is not for this Court, because of the Commerce Clause, to deny the exercise locally of the sovereign power of the state.  Pp.   341 U. S. 640 -641. 3. The ordinance does not abridge the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   341 U. S. 641 -645. (a) The fact that periodicals are sold does not put them beyond the protection of the First Amendment.  Pp.   341 U. S. 641 -642. (b) The constitutional guaranties of free speech and free press are not absolutes.  P.   341 U. S. 642 . (c)  Martin v. Struthers,   319 U. S. 141 ;  Marsh v. Alabama,   326 U. S. 501 ; and  Tucker v. Texas,   326 U. S. 517 , distinguished.  Pp.   341 U. S. 642 -644. (d) It would be a misuse of the great guaranties of free speech and free press to use them to force a community to admit the solicitors of publications to the home premises of its residents.  P.   341 U. S. 645 . 217 La. 820,  47 So. 2d 553 , affirmed. "

 SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT
 Syllabus   1. The Federal Constitution does not forbid a municipality to require its employees to execute affidavits disclosing whether or not they are or ever have been members of the Communist Party or the Communist Political Association.  P.   341 U. S. 720 . 2. In 1941, the California Legislature amended the Charter of the City of Los Angeles so as to provide, in substance, that no person shall hold or retain or be eligible for any public office or employment in the service of the City (1) who advises, advocates or teaches the overthrow by force or violence of the State or Federal Government or belongs to an organization which does so, or (2) who, within the five years prior to the effective date, had so advised, advocated or taught or had belonged to an organization which did so.  In 1948, the City passed an ordinance requiring each of its officers and employees to take an oath that he has not, within the five years preceding the effective date of the ordinance, does not now, and will not while in the service of the City, advise, advocate or teach the overthrow by force, violence or other unlawful means, of the State or Federal Government or belong to an organization which does so or has done so within such five-year period. Held:   The ordinance is not a bill of attainder or  ex post facto  law, nor, as here construed, does it violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   341 U. S. 720 -724. (a) The Charter amendment is valid under the Federal Constitution to the extent that it bars from the City's public service persons who, since its adoption in 1941, advise, advocate or teach the violent overthrow of the Government or who are or become affiliated with any group doing so, since the provisions, thus operating prospectively, are a reasonable regulation to protect the municipal service.  The question of its validity insofar as it purported to apply retrospectively for a five-year period prior to its effective date is not here involved.  Pp.   341 U. S. 720 -721. (b) The ordinance clearly is not  ex post facto,  since the activity covered by the oath had been proscribed by the Charter in the same terms, for the same purpose, and to the same effect over   seven years before, and two years prior to the period covered by the oath.  P.   341 U. S. 721 . (c) The ordinance is not a bill of attainder, since no punishment is imposed by a general regulation which merely provides standards of qualification and eligibility for public employment.   Lovett v. United States,   328 U. S. 303 , distinguished.  Pp.   341 U. S. 722 -723. (d) It is assumed here that the oath will not be construed as affecting adversely persons who during their affiliation with a proscribed organization were innocent of its purpose, or those who severed their relations with any such organization when its character became apparent, or those who were affiliated with organizations which were not engaged in proscribed activities at the time of their affiliation; and that, if this interpretation of the oath is correct, the City will give those petitioners who heretofore refused to take the oath an opportunity to take it as interpreted and resume their employment.  As thus construed, the requirement of the oath does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   341 U. S. 723 -724. 98 Cal. App. 2d 493 , 220 P.2d 958, affirmed. In a suit by discharged employees of a city for reinstatement and unpaid salaries, the state court denied relief.   98 Cal. App. 2d 493 , 220 P.2d 958.  This Court granted certiorari. 340 U.S. 941.

 Syllabus   The Civil Service Law of New York, § 12-a, makes ineligible for employment in any public school any member of any organization advocating the overthrow of the Government by force, violence or any unlawful means.  Section 3022 of the Education Law, added by the Feinberg Law, requires the Board of Regents (1) to adopt and enforce rules for the removal of any employee who violates, or is ineligible under, § 12-a, (2) to promulgate a list of organizations described in § 12-a, and (3) to provide in its rules that membership in any organization so listed is  prima facie  evidence of disqualification for employment in the public schools.  No organization may be so listed, and no person severed from or denied employment, except after a hearing and subject to judicial review. Held:   This Court finds no constitutional infirmity in § 12-a of the Civil Service Law of New York or in § 3022 of the Education Law.  Pp.   342 U. S. 486 -496. 1. Section 3022 and the rules promulgated thereunder do not constitute an abridgment of the freedom of speech and assembly of persons employed or seeking employment in the public schools of New York.   Garner v. Los Angeles Board,   341 U. S. 716 .  Pp.   342 U. S. 491 -493. 2. The provision of § 3022 directing the Board of Regents to provide in rules thereunder that membership in any organization so listed by the Board shall constitute  prima facie  evidence of disqualification for employment in the public schools does not deny members of such organizations due process of law.  Pp.   342 U. S. 494 -496. 3. The use of the word ""subversive"" in § 1 of the Feinberg Law, which is a preamble and not a definitive part of the Act, does not render the statute void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause, in view of the fact that, in subdivision 2 of § 3022, it is given a very definite meaning --  i.e.,  an organization that advocates the overthrow of government by force or violence.  P.   342 U. S. 496 . 4. The constitutionality of § 3021 of the Education Law not having been questioned in the proceedings in the lower courts and being raised here for the first time, it will not be passed upon by this Court before the state courts have had an opportunity to pass upon it.  P.   342 U. S. 496 . 301 N.Y. 476, 95 N.E.2d 806, affirmed.  In a declaratory judgment action, the Supreme Court of New York, Kings County, held that subdivision (c) of § 12-a of the New York Civil Service Law, § 3022 of the New York Education Law, and the rules of the State Board of Regents promulgated thereunder violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and enjoined action thereunder by the Board of Education of New York City.  196 Misc. 873, 95 N.Y.S.2d 114.

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   1. Under § 20(a) of the Immigration Act, as amended by § 23 of the Internal Security Act, the Attorney General may, in his discretion, hold in custody without bail, pending determination as to their deportability, aliens who are members of the Communist Party of the United States when there is reasonable cause to believe that their release on bail would endanger the safety and welfare of the United States.  Pp.   342 U. S. 526 -547. 2. The lack of a clause in the Constitution specifically empowering such action does not render Congress impotent to require the expulsion of resident alien Communists.  Pp.   342 U. S. 533 -537. (a) So long as aliens fail to obtain and maintain citizenship by naturalization, they remain subject to the plenary power of Congress to expel them under the sovereign right to determine what noncitizens shall be permitted to remain within our borders.  P.   342 U. S. 534 . (b) The doctrines and practices of Communism teach the use of force to achieve political control clearly enough to give constitutional basis, according to any theory of reasonableness or arbitrariness, for Congress to expel known alien Communists.  Pp.   342 U. S. 534 -536. 3. Under orders from the Acting Commissioner of Immigration, certain aliens were arrested under warrants issued after enactment of the Internal Security Act, charging them with being members of the Communist Party and directing that they be held in custody pending determination of deportability.  They petitioned for habeas corpus.  Respondent filed returns alleging that there was reasonable cause to believe that their release would endanger the welfare and safety of the United States.  Later, he filed affidavits that the Service had evidence indicating that each petitioner was,   at the time of arrest, a member of the Communist Party, and had, since 1930, participated, or was then actively participating, in the Party's indoctrination of others to the prejudice of the public interest. Held: (a) The refusal of bail in these cases was not arbitrary or capricious, or an abuse of power, and did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   342 U. S. 537 -542. (1) The discretion as to bail vested in the Attorney General by the Internal Security Act was broad enough to justify petitioners' detention without bail as a menace to the public interest.  Pp.   342 U. S. 537 -541. (2) There is no denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment in the detention of alien Communists without bail, pending determination of deportability, where there is reasonable cause to believe that their release on bail would endanger the safety and welfare of the United States.  Pp.   342 U. S. 541 -542. (b) The delegation to the Attorney General of discretionary authority to detain such aliens without bail pending deportation hearings does not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power or violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, because the statute contains definite legislative standards for deportation and such authority is to be exercised within the framework of the Subversive Activities Control Act to guard against Communist activities pending deportation hearings.  Pp.   342 U. S. 542 -544. (c) The Eighth Amendment does not require that bail be allowed in the circumstances of these cases.  Pp.   342 U.S. 544 -546. 4. Prior to enactment of the Internal Security Act, an alien Communist was arrested under a warrant charging that he was subject to deportation as an alien member of an organization advocating the violent overthrow of the Government, but he was released on bail.  After the effective date of the Act, he was again taken into custody under the same warrant, and held without bail under an order from the Acting Commissioner of Immigration, based on §§ 22 and 23 of the Internal Security Act. Held:   he must be released unless, within a reasonable time, in the discretion of the court, he  is rearrested under a new warrant.  Pp.   342 U. S. 531 ,   342 U.

 FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   1. The Alien Registration Act of 1940, so far as it authorizes the deportation of a legally resident alien because of membership in the Communist Party, even though such membership terminated before enactment of the Act, was within the power of Congress under the Federal Constitution.  Pp.   342 U. S. 581 -596. (a) The Act does not deprive the alien of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   342 U. S. 584 -591. (1) The power to deport aliens is inherent in every sovereign state.  Pp.   342 U. S. 587 -588. (2) The policy toward aliens is so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of the Government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference, and it cannot be said that the power has been so unreasonably or harshly exercised by Congress in this Act as to warrant judicial interference.  Pp.   342 U. S. 588 -590. (3) The fact that the Act inflicts severe hardship on the individuals affected does not render it violative of the Due Process Clause.  Pp.   342 U. S. 590 -591. (b) The Act does not abridge the aliens' freedoms of speech and assembly in contravention of the First Amendment.  Pp.   342 U. S. 591 -592. (c) The Act does not contravene the provision of Art. I, § 9 of the Constitution forbidding  ex post facto  laws.  Pp.   342 U. S. 593 -596. 2. Procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act are not mandatory as to proceedings which were instituted before the effective date of the Act.  P. 583,   n  4.  3. One who consented to the same individual acting both as presiding officer and examining officer in administrative proceedings is without standing, on judicial review, to raise the objection that he was thereby denied procedural due process.

 Syllabus   Over his claim that the statute violated the liberty of speech and of the press guaranteed as against the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and was void for vagueness, petitioner was convicted in a state court for distributing on the streets of Chicago anti-Negro leaflets in violation of Ill.Rev.Stat., 1949, c. 38, § 471, which makes it a crime to exhibit in any public place any publication which ""portrays depravity, criminality, unchastity, or lack of virtue of a class of citizens, of any race, color, creed or religion"" which ""exposes the citizens of any race, color, creed or religion to contempt, derision, or obloquy."" Held: 1. As construed and applied in this case, the statute does not violate the liberty of speech and of the press guaranteed as against the States by ihe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   343 U. S. 251 -264. 2. As construed and applied in this case, the statute is not void for vagueness.   Winters v. New York,   333 U. S. 507 ;  Stromberg v. California,   283 U.

Since petitioner did not, by appropriate steps in the trial court, seek to justify his utterance as ""fair comment"" or as privileged as a means for redressing grievances, those hypothetical defenses cannot be considered by this Court.  Pp.   343 U. S. 264 -265. 4. Since the Illinois Supreme Court construed this statute as a form of criminal libel law, and truth of the utterance is not a defense to a charge of criminal libel under Illinois law unless the publication is also made ""with good motives and for justifiable ends,"" petitioner was not denied due process by the trial court's rejection of a proffer of proof which did not satisfy this requirement.  Pp.   343 U. S. 253 -254,   343 U. S. 265 -266. 5. Since libelous utterances are not within the area of constitutionally protected speech, it is not necessary for this Court to consider the issues raised by the denial of petitioner's request that the jury be instructed that, in order to convict, they must find that the publication complained of was likely to produce a ""clear and present danger"" of a substantial evil.  Pp.   343 U. S. 253 ,   343 U. S. 266 . 408 Ill. 512 ,  97 N.E.2d 343 , affirmed.

 Syllabus   Provisions of the New York Education Law which forbid the commercial showing of any motion picture film without a license and authorize denial of a license on a censor's conclusion that a film is ""sacrilegious,""  held  void as a prior restraint on freedom of speech and of the press under the First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   343 U. S. 497 -506. 1. Expression by means of motion pictures is included within the free speech and free press guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   343 U. S. 499 -502. (a) It cannot be doubted that motion pictures are a significant medium for the communication of ideas.  Their importance as an organ of public opinion is not lessened by the fact that they are designed to entertain as well as to inform.  P.   343 U. S. 501 . (b) That the production, distribution and exhibition of motion pictures is a large-scale business conducted for private profit does not prevent motion pictures from being a form of expression whose liberty is safeguarded by the First Amendment.  Pp.   343 U. S. 501 -502. (c) Even if it be assumed that motion pictures possess a greater capacity for evil, particularly among the youth of a community, than other modes of expression, it does not follow that they are not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment or may be subjected to substantially unbridled censorship.  P.   343 U. S. 502 . (d) To the extent that language in the opinion in  Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm'n,   236 U.

(a) Though the Constitution does not require absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all times and all places, there is no justification in this case for making an   exception to the basic principles of freedom of expression previously announced by this Court with respect to other forms of expression.  Pp.   343 U. S. 502 -503. (b) Such a prior restraint as that involved here is a form of infringement upon freedom of expression to be especially condemned.   Near v. Minnesota,   283 U. S. 697 .

Pp.   343 U. S. 504 -505. (d) From the standpoint of freedom of speech and the press, a state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them which is sufficient to justify prior restraints upon the expression of those views.

 Syllabus   In a suit brought in a New York state court by a corporation, holder of the legal title, to determine which prelate was entitled to the use and occupancy of a Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church in New York City, the Court of Appeals of New York held for plaintiff, on the ground that Article 5-C of the Religious Corporations Law of New York had the purpose and effect of transferring the administrative control of the Russian Orthodox churches in North America from the Supreme Church Authority in Moscow to the authorities selected by a convention of the North American churches. Held:   ss thus construed and applied, the New York statute interferes with the free exercise of religion, contrary to the First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   344 U. S. 95 -121. (a) Legislation which determines, in an hierarchical church, ecclesiastical administration or the appointment of the clergy, or transfers control of churches from one group to another, interferes with the free exercise of religion contrary to the Constitution.  Pp.   344 U. S. 106 -116,   344 U. S. 119 . (b) That the purpose of such legislation is to protect American churches from infiltration of atheistic or subversive influences does not require a different result, though legislative power to punish subversive action cannot be doubted, and neither his robe nor his pulpit would be a defense to a cleric attempting subversive actions.

Pp.   344 U. S. 115 -116.

As construed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, it excludes persons from state employment solely on the basis of membership in such organizations, regardless of their knowledge concerning the activities and purposes of the organizations to which they had belonged. Held:   As thus construed, the Act violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   344 U. S. 184 -192.

 Syllabus   1. A city ordinance forbade the holding of a religious meeting in a public park without a license.  The State Supreme Court construed it as leaving to the licensing officials no discretion as to the granting of licenses, no power to discriminate, and no control over speech, and as calling merely for the adjustment of the unrestrained exercise of religions with the reasonable comfort and convenience of the whole city.   Held:   as thus construed, the ordinance does not violate the principles of the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   345 U. S. 402 -408. (a) Appellant's attack on the ordinance as applied to him, on the ground that it was repugnant to the principles of the First Amendment, and a determination of its validity by the State Supreme Court, required this Court to take jurisdiction on appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1257(2).  P.   345 U. S. 402 .

The State Supreme Court held that the proper state remedy for wrongful denial of the license was by certiorari to review the unlawful action of the licensing officials, not by holding public religious services in the park without a license and then defending because the refusal of the license was arbitrary.

 Syllabus   1. As here construed, §§ 305, 307 and 308 of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act are not too vague and indefinite to meet the requirements of due process.  Pp.   347 U. S. 617 -624. (a) If the general class of offenses to which a statute is directed is plainly within its terms, the statute will not be struck down as vague, even though marginal cases could be put where doubts might arise.  P.   347 U. S. 618 . (b) If this general class of offenses can be made constitutionally definite by a reasonable construction of the statute, the Court is under a duty to give the statute that construction.  P.   347 U. S. 618 . (c) Section 307 limits the coverage of the Act to those ""persons"" (except specified political committees) who solicit, collect, or receive contributions of money or other thing of value, and then only if one of the main purposes of either the persons or the contributions is to aid in the accomplishment of the aims set forth in § 307 (a) and (b).  Pp.   347 U. S. 618 -620,   347 U. S. 621 -623. (d) The purposes set forth in § 307(a) and (b) are here construed to refer only to ""lobbying in its commonly accepted sense"" -- to direct communication with members of Congress on pending or proposed legislation.  Pp.   347 U. S. 620 -621. (e) The ""principal purpose"" requirement was adopted merely to exclude from the scope of § 307 those contributions and persons having only an ""incidental"" purpose of influencing legislation.  It does not exclude a contribution which in substantial part is to be used to influence legislation through direct communication with Congress or a person whose activities in substantial part are directed to influencing legislation through direct communication with Congress.  Pp.   347 U. S. 621 -623. (f) There are three prerequisites to coverage under §§ 307, 305, and 308:  (1) the ""person"" must have solicited, collected or received contributions; (2) one of the main purposes of such ""person,"" or one of the main purposes of such contributions, must have been to influence the passage or defeat of legislation   by Congress; and (3) the intended method of accomplishing this purpose must have been through direct communication with members of Congress.  P.   347 U. S. 623 . 2. As thus construed, §§ 305 and 308 do not violate the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment -- freedom to speak, publish and petition the Government.  Pp.   347 U. S. 625 -626. 3. In this case, it is unnecessary for the Court to pass on the contention that the penalty provision in § 310(b) violates the First Amendment.  Pp.   347 U. S. 626 -627. (a) Section 310(b) has not yet been applied to appellees, and it will never be so applied if appellees are found innocent of the charges against them.  P.   347 U. S. 627 . (b) The elimination of § 310(b) would still leave a statute defining specific duties and providing a specific penalty for violation of any such duty, and the separability provision of the Act can be given effect if § 310(b) should ultimately be found invalid.  P.   347 U. S. 627 . 109 F. Supp. 641 , reversed."

 FOR THE: DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   During his employment as a special consultant in a federal agency, petitioner had been twice cleared by the agency's loyalty board.  Subsequently, acting solely on its own motion, the Civil Service Commission's Loyalty Review Board (established under Executive Order 9835) determined that there was a reasonable doubt as to petitioner's loyalty, and notified him that he was barred from federal service for a period of three years.  Thereafter, petitioner was removed from his position.  By an action in a Federal District Court, petitioner challenged the validity of his removal and debarment from federal employment. Held: 1. This case can be decided without reaching certain constitutional issues raised by petitioner, stemming chiefly from the denial to petitioner of any opportunity to confront and cross-examine his secret accusers.  Pp.   349 U. S. 337 -338. 2. The Loyalty Review Board's action was invalid as beyond the Board's jurisdiction under Executive Order 9835, and was an unwarranted assumption of power.  Pp.   349 U. S. 338 -348. (a) Under the provisions of the Executive Order, the Loyalty Review Board's jurisdiction to review individual cases was limited to appeals from rulings adverse to employees which were referred to the Board by the employees or their departments or agencies.  The Board had no authority to review rulings favorable to employees or to adjudicate individual cases on its own motion.  Pp.   349 U. S. 339 -340,   349 U. S. 342 -344. (b) Regulation 14 of the Loyalty Review Board, to the extent that it purports to authorize the Board to adjudicate individual cases on its own motion and despite a favorable determination below, is invalid as inconsistent with the provisions of Executive Order 9835.  Pp.   349 U. S. 340 -345. (c) While loyalty proceedings may not involve the imposition of criminal sanctions, the limitation on the Board's review power to adverse determinations was in keeping with the deeply rooted principle of criminal law that a verdict of guilty is appealable, while a verdict of acquittal is not.  Pp.   349 U. S. 344 -345.  (d) The President's failure to express disapproval of Regulation 14 cannot be deemed to constitute acquiescence in it.  Pp.   349 U. S. 345 -347. (e) The order of debarment, moreover, did not comply with Civil Service Rule V, § 5.101(a), which bars an employee from ""the competitive service"" within three years after ""a final determination"" that he is disqualified for federal employment on loyalty grounds, because (i) the order was not limited to the ""competitive service,"" but extended to all federal employment, and (ii) it purported to become effective before the employing agency had made any ""final determination.""  Pp.   349 U. S. 347 -348. 3. Petitioner is entitled to a declaratory judgment that his removal and debarment were invalid and to an order directing the respondent members of the Civil Service Commission to expunge from its records (a) the Loyalty Review Board's finding that there is a reasonable doubt as to petitioner's loyalty, and (b) any ruling that petitioner is barred from federal employment by reason of that finding.  Pp.   349 U. S. 348 -349. 4. Since it appears that the term of petitioner's appointment would have expired on December 31, 1953, wholly apart from his removal on loyalty grounds, his prayer for reinstatement cannot be granted.  P.   349 U. S. 349 . Reversed. "

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner was convicted of a violation of 2 U.S.C. § 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned as a witness by either House of Congress or any committee thereof to refuse to answer any question ""pertinent to the question under inquiry.""  Summoned to testify before a Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities, petitioner testified freely about his own activities and associations, but he refused to answer questions as to whether he had known certain other persons to have been members of the Communist Party.  He based his refusal on the ground that those questions were outside of the proper scope of the Committee's activities, and not relevant to its work.  No clear understanding of the ""question under inquiry"" could be gleaned from the resolution authorizing the full Committee, the legislative history thereof, the Committee's practices thereunder, the action authorizing the Subcommittee, the statement of the Chairman at the opening of the hearings or his statement in response to petitioner's protest. Held:   Petitioner was not accorded a fair opportunity to determine whether he was within his rights in refusing to answer, and his conviction was invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   354 U. S. 181 -216. (a) The power of Congress to conduct investigations, inherent in the legislative process, is broad, but it is not unlimited.  P.   354 U. S. 187 . (b) Congress has no general authority to expose the private affairs of individuals without justification in terms of the functions of Congress.  P.   354 U. S. 187 . (c) No inquiry is an end in itself; it must be related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of Congress.  P.   354 U. S. 187 . (d) The Bill of Rights is applicable to congressional investigations, as it is to all forms of governmental action.  P.   354 U. S. 188 . (e) A congressional investigation is subject to the command that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or press or assembly.  Pp.   354 U. S. 196 -197.  (f) When First Amendment rights are threatened, the delegation of power to a congressional committee must be clearly revealed in its charter.   United States v. Rumely,   345 U. S. 41 .  P.   354 U. S. 198 . (g) A congressional investigation into individual affairs is invalid if unrelated to any legislative purpose, because it is beyond the powers conferred upon Congress by the Constitution.   Kilbourn v. Thompson,   103 U. S. 168 .  P.   354 U. S. 198 . (h) It cannot simply be assumed that every congressional investigation is justified by a public need that overbalances any private rights affected, since to do so would be to abdicate the responsibility placed by the Constitution upon the judiciary to insure that Congress does not unjustifiably encroach upon an individual's right of privacy nor abridge his liberty of speech, press, religion or assembly.  Pp.   354 U. S. 198 -199. (i) There is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure where the predominant result can be only an invasion of the private rights of individuals.  P.   354 U. S. 200 . (j) In authorizing an investigation by a committee, it is essential that the Senate or House should spell out the committee's jurisdiction and purpose with sufficient particularity to insure that compulsory process is used only in furtherance of a legislative purpose.  P.   354 U. S. 201 . (k) The resolution authorizing the Un-American Activities Committee does not satisfy this requirement, especially when read in the light of the practices of the Committee and subsequent actions of the House of Representatives extending the life of the Committee.  Pp.   354 U. S. 201 -205. (l) Every reasonable indulgence of legality must be accorded to the actions of a coordinate branch of our Government, but such deference cannot yield to an unnecessary and unreasonable dissipation of precious constitutional freedoms.  P.   354 U. S. 204 . (m) Protected freedoms should not be placed in danger in the absence of a clear determination by the House or Senate that a particular inquiry is justified by specific legislative need.  P.   354 U. S. 205 . (n) Congressional investigating committees are restricted to the missions delegated to them -- to acquire certain data to be used by the House or Senate in coping with a problem that falls within its legislative sphere -- and no witness can be compelled to make disclosures on matters outside that area.  P.   354 U. S. 206 .  (o) When the definition of jurisdictional pertinency is as uncertain and wavering as in the case of the Un-American Activities Committee, it becomes extremely difficult for the Committee to limit its inquiries to statutory pertinency.  P.   354 U. S. 206 . (p) The courts must accord to a defendant indicted under 2 U.S.C. § 192 every right which is guaranteed to defendants in all other criminal cases, including the right to have available information revealing the standard of criminality before the commission of the alleged offense.  Pp.   354 U. S. 207 -208. (q) Since the statute defines the crime as refusal to answer ""any question pertinent to the question under inquiry,"" part of the standard of criminality is the pertinency of the questions propounded to the witness.  P.   354 U. S. 208 . (r) Due process requires that a witness before a congressional investigating committee should not be compelled to decide, at peril of criminal prosecution, whether to answer questions propounded to him without first knowing the ""question under inquiry"" with the same degree of explicitness and clarity that the Due Process Clause requires in the expression of any element of a criminal offense.   Sinclair v. United States,   279 U. S. 263 .  Pp.   354 U. S. 208 -209. (s) The authorizing resolution, the remarks of the chairman or members of the committee, or even the nature of the proceedings themselves, might make the ""question under inquiry"" sufficiently clear to avoid the ""vice of vagueness""; but these sources often leave the matter in grave doubt.  P.   354 U. S. 209 . (t) In this case, it is not necessary to pass on the question whether the authorizing resolution defines the ""question under inquiry"" with sufficient clarity, since the Government does not contend that it could serve that purpose.  P.   354 U. S. 209 . (u) The opening statement of the Chairman at the outset of the hearings here involved is insufficient to serve that purpose, since it merely paraphrased the authorizing resolution, and gave a very general sketch of the past efforts of the Committee.  Pp.   354 U. S. 209 -210. (v) Nor was that purpose served by the action of the full Committee in authorizing the creation of the Subcommittee before which petitioner appeared, since it merely authorized the Chairman to appoint subcommittees ""for the purpose of performing any and all acts which the Committee as a whole is authorized to do.""  Pp.   354 U. S. 211 -212. (w) On the record in this case, especially in view of the precise questions petitioner was charged with refusing to answer, it cannot   be said that the ""question under inquiry"" was Communist infiltration into labor unions.  Pp.   354 U. S. 212 -214. (x) Unless the subject matter of the inquiry has been made to appear with undisputable clarity, it is the duty of the investigative body, upon objection of the witness on grounds of pertinency, to state for the record the subject under inquiry at that time and the manner in which the propounded questions are pertinent thereto.  Pp.   354 U. S. 214 -215. (y) The Chairman's response, when petitioner objected to the questions on grounds of pertinency, was inadequate to convey sufficient information as to the pertinency of the questions to the ""question under inquiry.""

 Syllabus   1. This case was brought here on appeal under 28 U.S.C. §1257(2); but the appellant has failed to meet his burden of showing that jurisdiction by appeal was properly invoked.   Held:   The appeal is dismissed.  Treating the papers as a petition for certiorari under 28 U.S.C. § 2103, certiorari is granted.  Pp.   354 U. S. 235 -236. 2. In an investigation conducted by a State Attorney General, acting on behalf of the State Legislature under a broad resolution directing him to determine whether there were ""subversive persons"" in the State and to recommend further legislation on that subject, appellant answered most questions asked him, including whether he was a Communist; but he refused to answer questions related to (1) the contents of a lecture he had delivered at the State University, and (2) his knowledge of the Progressive Party of the State and its members.  He did not plead his privilege against self-incrimination, but based his refusal to answer such questions on the grounds that they were not pertinent to the inquiry and violated his rights under the First Amendment.  Persisting in his refusal when haled into a State Court and directed to answer, he was adjudged guilty of contempt.  This judgment was affirmed by the State Supreme Court, which construed the term ""subversive persons"" broadly enough to include persons engaged in conduct only remotely related to actual subversion and done completely apart from any conscious intent to be a part of such activity.  It also held that the need of the Legislature to be informed on the subject of self-preservation of government outweighed the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred in the process.   Held:   on the record in this case, appellant's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated, and the judgment is reversed.  Pp.   354 U.

 Syllabus   Respondent owns and operates a gravel pit in Wisconsin, where it employs 15 to 20 men.  Petitioner unions sought unsuccessfully to induce some of respondent's employees to join the unions, and began picketing the entrance to respondent's gravel pit with signs reading, ""The men on this job are not 100% affiliated with the A.F.L.""  As a result, drivers of several trucking companies refused to deliver and haul goods to and from respondent's plant, causing substantial damage to respondent.  On respondent's application, a State Court enjoined the picketing.  The injunction was sustained by the State Supreme Court on findings by it that (1) the picketing had been engaged in for the purpose of coercing respondent to force its employees to become members of petitioner unions, and (2) such picketing was for ""an unlawful purpose,"" since Wis.Stat. § 111.06(2)(b) made it an unfair labor practice for an employee individually or in concert with others to ""coerce, intimidate or induce an employer to interfere with any of his employes in the enjoyment of their legal rights . . . or to engage in any practice with regard to his employes which would constitute an unfair labor practice if undertaken by him on his own initiative."" Held:   the judgment is affirmed.  Pp.   354 U. S. 285 -295. (a) Prior decisions of this Court have established a broad field in which a State, in enforcing some public policy, whether of its criminal or its civil law, and whether announced by its legislature or its courts, may constitutionally enjoin peaceful picketing aimed at preventing effectuation of that policy.  Pp.   354 U. S. 287 -293. (b) Consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, a State may enjoin peaceful picketing the purpose of which is to coerce an employer to put pressure on his employees to join a union in violation of the declared policy of the State.

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The 14 petitioners, leaders of the Communist Party in California, were indicted in 1951 in a Federal District Court under § 3 of the Smith Act and 18 U.S.C. § 371 for conspiring (1) to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) to organize, as the Communist Party of the United States, a society of persons who so advocate and teach, all with the intent of causing the overthrow of the Government by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit.  The indictment charged that the conspiracy originated in 1940 and continued down to the date of the indictment, and that, in carrying it out, petitioners and their coconspirators would (a) become members and officers of the Communist Party, with knowledge of its unlawful purposes, and assume leadership in carrying out its policies and activities, (b) cause to be organized units of the Party in California and elsewhere, (c) write and publish articles on such advocacy and teaching, (d) conduct schools for the indoctrination of Party members in such advocacy and teaching, and (e) recruit new Party members, particularly from among persons employed in the key industries of the Nation.  It also alleged 23 overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Petitioners were convicted after a jury trial, and their convictions were sustained by the Court of Appeals. Held:   The convictions are reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to enter judgments of acquittal as to five of the petitioners and to grant a new trial as to the others.  Pp.   354 U. S. 300 -338. 1. Since the Communist Party came into being in 1945, and the indictment was not returned until 1951, the three-year statute of limitations had run on the ""organizing"" charge, and required the withdrawal of that part of the indictment from the jury's consideration.  Pp.   354 U. S. 303 -312.  (a) Applying the rule that criminal statutes are to be construed strictly, the word ""organize,"" as used in the Smith Act, is construed as referring only to acts entering into the creation of a new organization, and not to acts thereafter performed in carrying on its activities, even though the latter may loosely be termed ""organizational.""  Pp. 303-311. (b) The trial court's mistaken construction of the word ""organize"" was not harmless error; the circumstances are such as to call for application of the rule which requires a verdict to be set aside where it is supportable on one ground, but not another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.  Pp.   354 U. S. 311 -312. 2. The Smith Act does not prohibit advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of the Government as an abstract principle, divorced from any effort to instigate action to that end; the trial court's charge to the jury furnished wholly inadequate guidance on this central point in the case, and the conviction cannot be allowed to stand.   Dennis v. United States,   341 U. S. 494 , distinguished.  Pp.   354 U. S. 312 -327. 3. The evidence against five of the petitioners is so clearly insufficient that their acquittal should be ordered, but that as to the others is such as not to justify closing the way to their retrial.  Pp.   354 U. S. 327 -334. 4. Determinations favorable to petitioner Schneiderman made by this Court in  Schneiderman v. United States,   320 U. S. 118 , a denaturalization proceeding in which he was the prevailing party, are not conclusive in this proceeding under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and he is not entitled to a judgment of acquittal on that ground.

 Syllabus   In a proceeding under §22-a of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure, a State Court, sitting in equity, found that certain booklets displayed for sale by appellants were clearly obscene, and it enjoined their further distribution and ordered their destruction. Held:   resort to this remedy by the State was not violative of the freedom of speech and press protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from encroachment by the States.  Pp.   354 U. S. 437 -445. (a) A State could constitutionally convict appellants for keeping for sale booklets found to be obscene.   Alberts v. California, post,  p.   354 U. S. 476 .  P.   354 U. S. 440 . (b) Nothing in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment restricts a State to the criminal process in seeking to protect its people from the dissemination of pornography.  P.   354 U. S. 441 . (c) The injunction here sustained no more amounts to a ""prior restraint"" on freedom of speech or press than did the criminal prosecution in  Alberts v. California, supra,  where the defendant was fined, sentenced to imprisonment, and put on probation for two years on condition that he not violate the obscenity statute.  Pp.   354 U. S. 441 -444. (d) The Due Process Clause does not subject the States to the necessity of having trials by jury in misdemeanor prosecutions, and the procedure prescribed by § 22-a of the New York statute for determination whether a publication is obscene does not differ in essential procedural safeguards from that provided under many state statutes making the distribution of obscene publications a misdemeanor.  Pp.   354 U. S. 443 -444. (e) The provision in § 22-a for the seizure and destruction of instruments of ascertained wrongdoing is a resort to a legal remedy long sanctioned in Anglo-American law.

 FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   1. In the  Roth  case, the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 1461, which makes punishable the mailing of material that is ""obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy . . . or other publication of an indecent character,"" and Roth's conviction thereunder for mailing an obscene book and obscene circulars and advertising, are sustained.  Pp.   354 U. S. 479 -494. 2. In the  Albert  case, the constitutionality of § 311 of West's California Penal Code Ann., 1955, which,  inter alia,  makes it a misdemeanor to keep for sale, or to advertise, material that is ""obscene or indecent,"" and Alberts' conviction thereunder for lewdly keeping for sale obscene and indecent books and for writing, composing, and publishing an obscene advertisement of them, are sustained.  Pp.   354 U. S. 479 -494. 3. Obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected freedom of speech or press either (1) under the First Amendment, as to the Federal Government, or (2) under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as to the States.  Pp.   354 U. S. 481 -485. (a) In the light of history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing of the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance.  Pp.   354 U. S. 482 -483. (b) The protection given speech and press was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.  P.   354 U. S. 484 . (c) All ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance -- unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion -- have the full protection of the guaranties, unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests; but implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance.  Pp.   354 U. S. 484 -485.  4. Since obscenity is not protected, constitutional guaranties were not violated in these cases merely because, under the trial judges' instructions to the juries, convictions could be had without proof either that the obscene material would perceptibly create a clear and present danger of antisocial conduct, or probably would induce its recipients to such conduct.   Beauharnais v. Illinois,   343 U. S. 250 .  Pp.   354 U. S. 485 -490. (a) Sex and obscenity are not synonymous.  Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest --  i.e.,  material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts.  P.   354 U. S. 487 . (b) It is vital that the standards for judging obscenity safeguard the protection of freedom of speech and press for material which does not treat sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.  Pp.   354 U. S. 487 -488. (c) The standard for judging obscenity, adequate to withstand the charge of constitutional infirmity, is whether, to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest.  Pp.   354 U. S. 488 -489. (d) In these cases, both trial courts sufficiently followed the proper standard and used the proper definition of obscenity.  Pp.   354 U. S. 489 -490. 5. When applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, 18 U.S.C. § 1461, which makes punishable the mailing of material that is ""obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy . . . or other publication of an indecent character,"" does not (1) violate the freedom of speech or press guaranteed by the First Amendment, or (2) violate the constitutional requirements of due process by failing to provide reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt.  Pp.   354 U. S. 491 -492. 6. When applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, § 311 of West's California Penal Code Ann., 1955, which,  inter alia,  makes it a misdemeanor to keep for sale or to advertise material that is ""obscene or indecent,"" does not (1) violate the freedom of speech or press guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against encroachment by the States, or (2) violate the constitutional requirements of due process by failing to provide reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt.  Pp.   354 U. S. 491 -492. 7. The federal obscenity statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1461, punishing the use of the mails for obscene material, is a proper exercise of the postal power delegated to Congress by Art. I, § 8, cl. 7, and it   does not unconstitutionally encroach upon the powers reserved to the States by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.  Pp.   354 U. S. 492 -493. 8. The California obscenity statute here involved is not repugnant to Art. I, § 8, cl. 7, since it does not impose a burden upon, or interfere with, the federal postal functions -- even when applied to a mail-order business.  Pp.   354 U. S. 493 -494. 237 F.2d 796, affirmed. 138 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 909 , 292 P.2d 90, affirmed. "

 Syllabus   A city ordinance made it an offense to ""solicit"" citizens of the City to become members of any ""organization, union or society"" which requires fees or dues from its members without first applying for and receiving from the Mayor and Council a ""permit,"" which they might grant or refuse after considering the character of the applicant, the nature of the organization and its effects upon the general welfare of the citizens.  For soliciting applications for membership in a labor union in the private homes of employees without applying for or obtaining such a permit, appellant was convicted of a violation of this ordinance and sentenced to fine or imprisonment, notwithstanding her claim that the ordinance violated her rights under the Federal Constitution.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed.  It declined to pass on appellant's contention, on the grounds that (1) appellant lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of the ordinance because she had made no attempt to obtain a permit under it, and (2) under state procedure, her attack should have been made against specific sections of the ordinance, and not against the ordinance as a whole. Held: 1. The decision of the State Court of Appeals does not rest on an adequate nonfederal ground, and this Court has jurisdiction of this appeal.  Pp.   355 U. S. 318 -320. (a) Failure to apply for a license under an ordinance which on its face violates the Constitution does not preclude review in this Court of a judgment of conviction under such an ordinance.  P.   355 U. S. 319 . (b) In the circumstances of this case, appellant's failure to attack specific sections of the ordinance, in accordance with state procedure, is not an adequate nonfederal ground of decision.  Pp.   355 U. S. 319 -320. 2. The ordinance is invalid on its face because it makes enjoyment of the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech contingent upon the will of the Mayor and Council, and thereby constitutes a prior restraint upon, and abridges, that freedom, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.

 Syllabus   At a time when an Act of Congress required a passport for foreign travel by citizens if a state of national emergency had been declared by the President, and when the Proclamation necessary to make the Act effective had been made, the Secretary of State denied passports to petitioners because of their alleged Communistic beliefs and associations and their refusal to file affidavits concerning present or past membership in the Communist Party. Held:   The Secretary was not authorized to deny the passports for these reasons under the Act of July 3, 1926, 22 U.S.C. § 211a, or § 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. § 1185.  Pp.   357 U. S. 117 -130. (a) The right to travel is a part of the ""liberty"" of which a citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   357 U. S. 125 -127. (b) The broad power of the Secretary under 22 U.S.C. § 211a to issue passports, which has long been considered ""discretionary,"" has been construed generally to authorize the refusal of a passport only when the applicant (1) is not a citizen or a person owing allegiance to the United States, or (2) was engaging in criminal or unlawful conduct.  Pp.   357 U. S. 124 -125,   357 U. S. 127 -128. (c) This Court hesitates to impute to Congress, when, in 1952, it made a passport necessary for foreign travel and left its issuance to the discretion of the Secretary of State, a purpose to give him unbridled discretion to withhold a passport from a citizen for any substantive reason he may choose.  P.   357 U. S. 128 . (d) No question concerning the exercise of the war power is involved in this case.  P.   357 U. S. 128 . (e) If a citizen's liberty to travel is to be regulated, it must be pursuant to the lawmaking functions of Congress, any delegation of the power must be subject to adequate standards, and such delegated authority will be narrowly construed.  P.   357 U. S. 129 . (f) The Act of July 3, 1926, 22 U.S.C. § 211a, and § 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. § 1185, do not delegate to the Secretary authority to withhold passports to   citizens because of their beliefs or associations, and any Act of Congress purporting to do so would raise grave constitutional questions.  Pp.   357 U. S. 129 -130. (g) The only Act of Congress expressly curtailing the movement of Communists across our borders, §§ 2 and 6 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, has not yet become effective, because the Communist Party has not registered under that Act, and there is not in effect a final order of the Board requiring it to do so.  P.   357 U. S. 121 , n. 3, p.   357 U. S. 130 . 101 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 239, 248 F.2d 600, 561, reversed."

 EASTERN DISTRICT
 Syllabus   Petitioner, a teacher in the public schools of Philadelphia, refused to answer questions relating to Communistic affiliations and activities asked by his Superintendent, after being warned that the inquiry related to his fitness to be a teacher, and that refusal to answer might lead to his dismissal.  After administrative proceedings in which his loyalty and his political beliefs and associations were not in issue, the Board of Education found that his refusal to answer his Superintendent's questions constituted ""incompetency,"" a ground for discharge under the state tenure statute, and discharged him.  The State Supreme Court sustained this action. Held:   his discharge did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   357 U. S. 400 -409. (a) By engaging in teaching in public schools, petitioner did not give up his right to freedom of belief, speech or association, but he did undertake obligations of frankness, candor, and cooperation in answering inquiries made by his superior examining into his fitness to serve as a public school teacher.  P.   357 U. S. 405 . (b) A municipal employer is not disabled, because it is an agency of the State, from inquiry of its employees as to matters that may prove relevant to their fitness and suitability for the public service.   Garner v. Board of Public Works,   341 U. S. 716 .  P.   357 U. S. 405 . (c) The questions petitioner refused to answer were relevant to his fitness and suitability as a teacher, and his discharge was based upon his insubordination and lack of frankness and candor in refusing to answer such questions -- not upon disloyalty or any of the activities inquired about.  Pp.   357 U. S. 405 -406. (d) The Federal Constitution does not require that a teacher's classroom conduct be the sole basis for determining his fitness.  P.   357 U. S. 406 . (e) The State Supreme Court held that ""incompetency,"" within the meaning of the relevant state statute, includes petitioner's   ""deliberate and insubordinate refusal to answer the questions of his administrative superior in a vitally important matter pertaining to his fitness,"" and this interpretation is not inconsistent with the Federal Constitution.  Pp.   357 U. S. 406 -408. (f) Petitioner's claim that he was denied due process because he was not sufficiently warned of the consequences of his refusal to answer his Superintendent's questions is not supported by the record.  P.   357 U. S. 408 . (g)  Slochower v. Board of Education,   350 U. S. 551 , and  Konigsberg v. State Bar of California,   353 U. S. 252 , distinguished.  Pp.   357 U.

 Syllabus   Solely because they refused to subscribe oaths that they do not advocate the overthrow of the Federal or State Government by force, violence or other unlawful means, or advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in event of hostilities, appellants were denied tax exemptions provided for veterans by the California Constitution.  The filing of such an oath was required by a California statute as a prerequisite to qualification for the tax exemption, in order to effectuate a provision of the State Constitution denying any tax exemption to any person who advocates such actions, which was construed by the State Supreme Court as denying tax exemptions only to claimants who engage in speech which may be criminally punished consistently with the free speech guarantees of the Federal Constitution. Held:   Enforcement of this provision through procedures which place the burdens of proof and persuasion on the taxpayers denied them freedom of speech without the procedural safeguards required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   357 U. S. 514 -529. 1. A discriminatory denial of a tax exemption for engaging in speech is a limitation on free speech.  Pp.   357 U. S. 518 -520. 2. The method chosen by California for determining whether a claimant is a member of the class to which its Supreme Court has said that the tax exemption is denied does not provide the procedural safeguards required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment before free speech may be denied, since it places on the taxpayer the burden of proving that he is not a member of that class.  Pp.   357 U. S. 520 -529. (a) When a State undertakes to restrain unlawful advocacy, it must provide procedures which are adequate to safeguard against infringement of constitutionally protected rights.  Pp.   357 U. S. 520 -521. (b) The California procedure places upon the taxpayer the burden of proving that he does not criminally advocate the overthrow   of the Federal or State Government by force, violence, or other unlawful means or advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in the event of hostilities.  Pp.   357 U. S. 521 -523. (c) It does not follow that because only a tax liability is here involved, the ordinary tax assessment procedures are adequate when applied to penalize speech.  Pp.   357 U. S. 523 -525. (d) Since free speech is involved, due process requires in the circumstances of this case that the State bear the burden of showing that appellants engaged in criminal speech.  Pp.   357 U. S. 525 -526. (e)  Garner v. Board of Public Works,   341 U. S. 716 ;  Gerende v. Board of Supervisors,   341 U. S. 56 , and  American Communications Assn. v. Douds,   339 U. S. 382 , distinguished.  Pp.   357 U. S. 527 -528. (f) When the constitutional right to speak is sought to be deterred by a State's general taxing program, due process demands that the speech be unencumbered until the State comes forward with sufficient proof to justify its inhibition.  Pp.   357 U. S. 528 -529. (g) Since the entire statutory procedure violated the requirements of due process by placing the burdens of proof and persuasion on them, appellants were not obliged to take even the first step in such procedure as a condition for obtaining the tax exemption.

Patterson No. 91 Argued January 15-16, 1958 Decided June 30, 1958 357 U.S. 449 CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA
 Syllabus   Petitioner is a nonprofit membership corporation organized under the laws of New York for the purpose of advancing the welfare of Negroes.  It operates through chartered affiliates which are independent unincorporated associations, with membership therein equivalent to membership in petitioner.  It had local affiliates in Alabama, and opened an office of its own there without complying with an Alabama statute which, with some exceptions, requires a foreign corporation to qualify before doing business in the State by filing its corporate charter and designating a place of business and an agent to receive service of process.  Alleging that petitioner's activities were causing irreparable injury to the citizens of the State for which criminal prosecution and civil actions at law afforded no adequate relief, the State brought an equity suit in a state court to enjoin petitioner from conducting further activities in, and to oust it from, the State.  The court issued an  ex parte  order restraining petitioner,  pendente lite,  from engaging in further activities in the State and from taking any steps to qualify to do business there.  Petitioner moved to dissolve the restraining order, and the court, on the State's motion, ordered the production of many of petitioner's records, including its membership lists.  After some delay, petitioner produced substantially all the data called for except its membership lists.  It was adjudged in contempt, and fined $100,000 for failure to produce the lists.  The State Supreme Court denied certiorari to review the contempt judgment, and this Court granted certiorari. Held: 1. Denial of relief by the State Supreme Court did not rest on an adequate state ground, and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain petitioner's federal claims.  Pp.   357 U. S. 454 -458. 2. Petitioner has a right to assert on behalf of its members a claim that they are entitled under the Federal Constitution to be protected from being compelled by the State to disclose their affiliation with the Association.  Pp.   357 U. S. 458 -460.  3. Immunity from state scrutiny of petitioner's membership lists is here so related to the right of petitioner's members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in doing so as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The State has failed to show  a controlling justification for the deterrent effect on the free enjoyment of the right to associate which disclosure of petitioner's membership lists is likely to have.  Accordingly, the judgment of civil contempt and the fine which resulted from petitioner's refusal to produce its membership lists must fall.  Pp.   357 U. S. 460 -466. (a) Freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the ""liberty"" assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   357 U. S. 460 -461. (b) In the circumstances of this case, compelled disclosure of petitioner's membership lists is likely to constitute an effective restraint on its members' freedom of association.  Pp.   357 U. S. 461 -463. (c) Whatever interest the State may have in obtaining the names of petitioner's ordinary members, it has not been shown to be sufficient to overcome petitioner's constitutional objections to the production order.  Pp.   357 U. S. 463 -466. 4. The question whether the state court's temporary restraining order preventing petitioner from soliciting support in the State violates the Fourteenth Amendment is not properly before this Court, since the merits of the controversy have not been passed on by the state courts.  Pp.   357 U. S. 466 -467. 265 Ala. 349,  91 So. 2d 214 , reversed, and cause remanded. "

 Syllabus   In an investigation conducted by the Attorney General of New Hampshire on behalf of the State Legislature under a resolution directing him to investigate violations of the State Subversive Activities Act and to determine whether ""subversive persons"" were then in the State, appellant, who is Executive Director of a corporation organized under the laws of the State and operating a summer camp in the State, testified concerning his own activities, but refused to comply with subpoenas  duces tecum  calling for the production of the names of all persons who attended the camp during 1954 and 1955.  Pursuant to state procedure, he was brought before a state court.  There, he did not plead the privilege against self-incrimination, but claimed that the investigation was beyond the power of the State, that the resolution was too vague, that the documents sought were not relevant to the inquiry, and that to compel him to produce them would violate his rights of free speech and association.  These claims were decided against him, and, persisting in his refusal, he was adjudged guilty of civil contempt and ordered committed to jail until he complied with the order. Held:   the judgment and sentence are sustained.  Pp.   360 U. S. 73 -82.

(c) On the record in this case, the nexus between the corporation, its summer camp and subversive activities which might threaten the security of the State justifies the investigation; the State's interests in self-preservation outweigh individual rights in associational privacy, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not preclude the State from compelling   production of the names of the guests.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Summoned to testify before a Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities, which was investigating alleged Communist infiltration into the field of education, petitioner, formerly a graduate student and teaching fellow at the University of Michigan, refused to answer questions as to whether he was then or had ever been a member of the Communist Party.  He disclaimed reliance upon the privilege against self-incrimination, but objected generally to the right of the Subcommittee to inquire into his ""political"" and ""religious"" beliefs or any ""other personal or private affairs"" or ""associational activities"" upon grounds set forth in a previously prepared memorandum, which was based on the First, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments, the prohibition against bills of attainder and the doctrine of separation of powers.  For such refusal, he was convicted of a violation of 2 U.S.C. § 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned as a witness by either House of Congress or a committee thereof to refuse to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry.  He was fined and sentenced to imprisonment for six months. Held:   Petitioner's conviction is sustained.  Pp.   360 U. S. 111 -134. 1. In the light of the Committee's history and the repeated extensions of its life, as well as the successive appropriations by the House of Representatives for the conduct of its activities, its legislative authority and that of the Subcommittee to conduct the inquiry under consideration here is unassailable, and House Rule XI, 83d Congress, which defines the Committee's authority, cannot be said to be constitutionally infirm on the score of vagueness.   Watkins v. United States,   354 U. S. 178 , distinguished.  Pp.   360 U. S. 116 -123. (a) Rule XI has a ""persuasive gloss of legislative history"" which shows beyond doubt that, in pursuance of its legislative concerns in the domain of ""national security,"" the House of Representatives has clothed the Committee with pervasive authority to investigate Communist activities in this country.  Pp.   360 U. S. 117 -121.  (b) In the light of the legislative history, Rule XI cannot be construed so as to exclude the field of education from the Committee's compulsory authority.  Pp.   360 U. S. 121 -123. 2. The record in this case refutes petitioner's contention that he was not adequately apprised of the pertinency of the Subcommittee's questions to the subject matter of the inquiry.   Watkins v. United States, supra,  distinguished.  Pp.   360 U. S. 123 -125. 3. On the record in this case, the balance between the individual and the governmental interests here at stake must be struck in favor of the latter, and therefore the provisions of the First Amendment were not transgressed by the Subcommittee's inquiry into petitioner's past or present membership in the Communist Party.  Pp.   360 U. S. 125 -134. (a) Where First Amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation, resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the courts of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown.  Pp.   360 U. S. 126 -127. (b) The investigation here involved was related to a valid legislative purpose, since Congress has wide power to legislate in the field of Communist activity in this Country and to conduct appropriate investigations in aid thereof.  Pp.   360 U. S. 127 -129. (c) Investigatory power in this domain is not to be denied Congress solely because the field of education is involved, and the record in this case does not indicate any attempt by the Committee to inquire into the content of academic lectures or discussions, but only to investigate the extent to which the Communist Party had succeeded in infiltrating into our educational institutions persons and groups committed to furthering the Party's alleged objective of violent overthrow of the Government.   Sweezy v. New Hampshire,   354 U. S. 234 , distinguished.  Pp.   360 U. S. 129 -132. (d) On the record in this case, it cannot be said that the true objective of the Committee and of the Congress was purely ""exposure,"" rather than furtherance of a valid legislative purpose.  Pp.   360 U. S. 132 -133. (e) The record is barren of other factors which, in themselves, might lead to the conclusion that the individual interests at stake were not subordinate to those of the Government.  P.   360 U. S. 134 . 102 U.S.App.D.C. 217, 252 F.2d 129, affirmed. "

 Syllabus   The four appellants were convicted in state courts for refusing to answer questions about Communistic or subversive activities put to them at sessions of the ""Un-American Activities Commission"" established in the legislative branch of the Ohio Government.  Each was led by the Commission to believe that the privilege against self-incrimination afforded by the Ohio Constitution was generally available to him, and each relied on that privilege; but the Ohio Supreme Court sustained their convictions on the ground that the privilege was not able to them, because a state immunity statute deprived them of the protection of that privilege. Held: 1. The appeals are dismissed for want of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1257(2), since appellants have not demonstrated that an attack was made by them in the state courts on the validity of a state statute under the Federal Constitution; but certiorari is granted, since various rights, privileges and immunities under the Federal Constitution were claimed in the state courts, as required by 28 U.S.C. §1257(3).  Pp.   360 U. S. 434 -437. 2. The convictions of three of the appellants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since they were entrapped by being convicted for exercising a privilege which the Commission had led them to believe was available to them.  Pp.   360 U. S. 437 -440. 3. The conviction of the other appellant for refusing to state where he lived after being directed by the Commission to do so is affirmed by an equally divided Court.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner, an aeronautical engineer, was general manager of a private corporation engaged in developing and producing for the Armed Forces goods involving military secrets, under contracts requiring the corporation to exclude from its premises persons not having security clearances.  Under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Defense without explicit authorization by either the President or Congress, and after administrative hearings in which he was denied access to much of the information adverse to him and any opportunity to confront or cross-examine witnesses against him, petitioner was deprived of his security clearance on the grounds of alleged Communistic associations and sympathies.  As a consequence, the corporation discharged him, and he was unable to obtain other employment as an aeronautical engineer.  He sued for a judgment declaring that the revocation of his security clearance was unlawful and void and an order restraining the Secretaries of the Armed Forces from acting pursuant to it. Held:   In the absence of explicit authorization from either the President or Congress, the Secretaries of the Armed Forces were not authorized to deprive petitioner of his job in a proceeding in which he was not afforded the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination.  Pp.   360 U. S. 475 -508. (a) Neither Executive Order No. 10290 nor Executive Order No. 10501 empowers any executive agency to fashion security programs whereby persons are deprived of their civilian employment and of the opportunity of continued activity in their chosen professions without being accorded the chance to challenge effectively the evidence and testimony upon which an adverse security determination might rest.  Pp.   360 U. S. 500 -502. (b) Neither the National Security Act of 1947 nor the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, even when read in conjunction with 18 U.S.C. § 798, making it a crime to communicate to unauthorized persons information concerning cryptographic or intelligence activities, and 50 U.S.C. § 783 (b), making it a crime   for an officer or employee of the United States to communicate classified information to agents of foreign governments or officers and members of ""Communist organizations,"" constitutes an authorization to create an elaborate clearance program under which persons may be seriously restrained in their employment opportunities through a denial of clearance without the safeguards of cross-examination and confrontation.  Pp.   360 U. S. 502 -504. (c) Congressional ratification of the security clearance procedures cannot be implied from the continued appropriation of funds to finance aspects of the program fashioned by the Department of Defense.  Pp.   360 U. S. 504 -505. (d) In this area of questionable constitutionality, this Court will not hold that a person may be deprived of the right to follow his chosen profession without full hearings where accusers may be confronted and cross-examined, when neither the President nor Congress has explicitly authorized such procedure.  Pp.   360 U. S. 506 -508. 103 U.S.App.D.C. 87, 254 F.2d 944, reversed, and cause remanded."

 Syllabus   Section 315(a) of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 provides, in effect, that, if anyone licensed to operate a radio broadcasting station shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for public office to broadcast over such station, he shall ""afford equal opportunities"" to all other such candidates for that office, and ""shall have no power of censorship"" over the material broadcast under this section.

 Syllabus   When petitioner was Acting Director of the Office of Rent Stabilization and respondents were subordinate officials of the same office, petitioner caused to be issued a press release announcing his intention to suspend respondents because of the part which they had played in formulating a plan for the utilization of certain agency funds.

 Syllabus   While actively participating as one of the defense counsel in a protracted and highly publicized trial in a Federal District Court in Hawaii of several defendants for conspiracy under the Smith Act, petitioner appeared with one of the defendants at a public meeting and made a speech which led to charges that she had impugned the impartiality and fairness of the presiding judge in conducting the trial and had thus reflected upon his integrity in dispensing justice in the case.  These charges were preferred by the Bar Association of Hawaii before the Territorial Supreme Court; that Court referred the charges to the Ethics Committee of the Bar Association, which held a hearing, and found the charges sustained.  The Territorial Supreme Court, upon review of the record, also sustained the charges, and ordered that petitioner be suspended from the practice of law for one year.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Held:   the record does not support the charge and the findings growing out of petitioner's speech, and the judgment is reversed.  Pp.   360 U.

 Syllabus   Appellant, proprietor of a bookstore, was convicted of violating a city ordinance which was construed by the state courts as making him absolutely liable criminally for the mere possession in his store of a book later judicially determined to be obscene -- even if he had no knowledge as to the contents of the book.   Held:   As thus construed and applied, the ordinance violates the freedom of the press which is safeguarded by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.  Pp.   361 U. S. 148 -155. (a) The free publication and dissemination of books obviously are within the constitutionally protected freedom of the press, and a retail bookseller plays a most significant role in the distribution of books.  P.   361 U. S. 150 . (b) Legal devices and doctrines, in most applications consistent with the Constitution, may not be constitutionally capable of application where such application would have the effect of inhibiting freedom of expression by making persons reluctant to exercise it.  Pp.   361 U. S. 150 -152. (c) Obscene expression is not constitutionally protected; but this ordinance imposes an unconstitutional limitation on the public's access to constitutionally protected matter.  For, if the bookseller be criminally liable without knowledge of the contents, he will tend to restrict the books he sells to those he has inspected, and thus a restriction will be imposed by the States upon the distribution of constitutionally protected, as well as obscene, books.  Pp.   361 U. S. 152 -154. (d) The existence of the State's power to prevent the distribution of obscene matter does not mean that there can be no constitutional barrier to any form of practical exercise of that power.  Hence, that there may be more difficultly in enforcing a regulation against the distribution of obscene literature if booksellers may not be held to an absolute criminal liability does not require a different result here.

Held:   On the record in this case, compulsory disclosure of the membership lists would work unjustified interference with the members' freedom of association, which is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by the States; and the convictions are reversed.  Pp.   361 U. S. 517 -527. (a) It is now beyond dispute that freedom of association for the purpose of advancing ideas and airing grievances is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by the States.  Pp.   361 U. S. 522 -523. (b) On the record in this case, it sufficiently appears that compulsory disclosure of the membership lists of the local branches of the Association would work a significant interference with the freedom of association of their members.  Pp.   361 U. S. 523 -524. (c) The cities here, as instrumentalities of the State, have not demonstrated so cogent an interest in obtaining and making public the membership lists of these organizations as to justify the substantial abridgment of associational freedom which such disclosures would effect, since the record discloses no relevant correlation between the power of the municipalities to impose occupational license taxes and the compulsory disclosure and publication of these membership lists.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   Section 202 (n) of the Social Security Act, as amended, provides for the termination of old-age benefits payable to an alien who, after the date of its enactment (September 1, 1954), is deported under § 241 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act on any one of certain grounds specified in § 202(n).  Appellee, an alien who had become eligible for old-age benefits in 1955, was deported in 1956, pursuant to § 241(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, for having been a member of the Communist Party from 1933 to 1939.  Since this was one of the grounds specified in § 202(n), his old-age benefits were terminated shortly thereafter.  He commenced this action in a single-judge District Court, under § 205(g) of the Social Security Act, to secure judicial review of that administrative decision.  The District Court held that § 202(n) deprived appellee of an accrued property right and, therefore, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Held: 1. Although this action drew into question the constitutionality of § 202(n), it did not involve an injunction or otherwise interdict the operation of the statutory scheme; 28 U.S.C. § 2282, forbidding the issuance of an injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of an Act of Congress for repugnance to the Constitution, except by a three-judge District Court, was not applicable; and jurisdiction over the action was properly exercised by the single-judge District Court.  Pp.   363 U. S. 606 -608. 2. A person covered by the Social Security Act has not such a right in old-age benefit payments as would make every defeasance of ""accrued"" interests violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   363 U. S. 608 -611. (a) The noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits are based on his contractual premium payments.  Pp.   363 U. S. 608 -610. (b) To engraft upon the Social Security System a concept of ""accrued property rights"" would deprive it of the flexibility and   boldness in adjustment to ever-changing conditions which it demands and which Congress probably had in mind when it expressly reserved the right to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Act.  Pp.   363 U. S. 610 -611. 3. Section 202(n) of the Act cannot be condemned as so lacking in rational justification as to offend due process.  Pp.   363 U. S. 611 -612. 4. Termination of appellee's benefits under § 202(n) does not amount to punishing him without a trial, in violation of Art. III, §2, Ch 3, of the Constitution or the Sixth Amendment; nor is § 202(n) a bill of attainder or  ex post facto law,  since its purpose is not punitive.  Pp.   363 U. S. 612 -621. 169 F.

 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS
 Syllabus   An Arkansas statute requires every teacher, as a condition of employment in a state supported school or college, to file annually an affidavit listing without limitation every organization to which he has belonged or regularly contributed within the preceding five years.  Teachers in state supported schools and colleges are not covered by a civil service system, they are hired on a year-to-year basis, and they have no job security beyond the end of each school year.  The contracts of the teachers here involved were not renewed, because they refused to file the required affidavits. Held:   The statute is invalid, because it deprives teachers of their right of associational freedom protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.  Pp.   364 U. S. 480 -490. (a) There can be no doubt of the right of a State to investigate the competence and fitness of those whom it hires to teach in its schools.  P.   364 U. S. 485 . (b) To compel a teacher to disclose his every associational tie is to impair his right of free association, a right closely allied to freedom of speech and a right which, like free speech, lies at the foundation of a free society.  Pp.   364 U. S. 485 -487. (c) The unlimited and indiscriminate sweep of the statute here involved and its comprehensive interference with associational freedom go far beyond what might be justified in the exercise of the State's legitimate inquiry into the fitness and competence of its teachers.

 FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The Municipal Code of Chicago, § 155-4, requires submission of all motion pictures for examination or censorship prior to their public exhibition and forbids their exhibition unless they meet certain standards.  Petitioner applied for a permit to exhibit a certain motion picture and tendered the required license fee, but the permit was denied solely because petitioner refused to submit the film for examination.  Petitioner sued in a Federal District Court for injunctive relief ordering issuance of the permit without submission of the film and restraining the city officials from interfering with its exhibition.  It did not submit the film to the court or offer any evidence as to its content.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground,  inter alia,  that neither a substantial federal question nor a justiciable controversy was presented. Held:   the provision requiring submission of motion pictures for examination or censorship prior to their public exhibition is not void on its face as violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and the judgment of dismissal is affirmed.  Pp.   365 U. S. 44 -50. (a) This case presents a justiciable controversy. Pp. 45-46. (b) Petitioner's narrow attack on the ordinance does not require that any consideration be given to the validity of the standards set out therein, since they are not challenged and are not before this Court.  Pp.   365 U. S. 46 -47. (c) It has never been held that liberty of speech is absolute, or that all prior restraints on speech are invalid.  Pp.   365 U. S. 47 -49. (d) Although motion pictures are included within the free speech and free press guaranties of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, there is no absolute freedom to exhibit publicly, at least once, every kind of motion picture.  Pp.   365 U. S. 46 ,   365 U. S. 49 -50. 272 F.2d 90 affirmed. "

 FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Summoned to testify before a Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities, which was investigating Communist infiltration into basic industries in the South and Communist Party propaganda activities in the South, petitioner refused to answer a question as to whether he was then a member of the Communist Party.  He did not claim his privilege against self-incrimination, but contended that the Subcommittee was without lawful authority to interrogate him, and that its questioning violated his rights under the First Amendment.  For refusing to answer, he was convicted of a violation of 2 U.S.C. § 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned as a witness by either House of Congress or a committee thereof to refuse to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry. Held:   Petitioner's conviction is sustained.  Pp.   365 U. S. 400 -415. 1. The Committee's investigation of Communist infiltration into basic industries in the South and Communist propaganda activities in the South was clearly authorized by Congress.   Barenblatt v. United States,   360 U. S. 109 .  Pp.   365 U. S. 407 -409. 2. On this record, it cannot be said that, in questioning petitioner, the Subcommittee was not pursuing a valid legislative purpose.  Pp.   365 U. S. 409 -413. (a) Petitioner's contention that the Subcommittee's sole reason for interrogating him was to subject him to public censure, harassment and exposure because of his opposition to the existence of the Un-American Activities Committee is not supported by the record.  Pp.   365 U. S. 411 -412. (b) It is not for this Court to speculate as to the motives that may have prompted the decision of individual members of the Subcommittee to summon petitioner, since their motives alone would not vitiate an investigation that was serving a legislative purpose.  P.   365 U. S. 412 . (c) Petitioner was not summoned to appear as a result of an indiscriminate dragnet procedure, lacking in probable cause for belief that he possessed information which might be helpful to the   Subcommittee, since the Subcommittee had reason to believe when it summoned him that he was an active Communist leader engaged primarily in propaganda activities.  Pp.   365 U. S. 412 -413 3. The question whether petitioner was then a member of the Communist Party was pertinent to a subject under inquiry.  P.   365 U. S. 413 . 4. Petitioner was clearly apprised of the pertinency of the question when he was directed to answer it.  P.   365 U. S. 413 . 5. The Subcommittee's interrogation of petitioner did not violate his rights under the First Amendment.   Barenblatt v. United States,   360 U. S. 109 .  Pp.   365 U. S. 413 -415. (a) It was not unlawful for the Committee to investigate petitioner's conduct, even though he may have been engaged, at the moment, in public criticism of the Committee and attempting to influence public opinion in favor of abolishing it.  P.   365 U. S. 414 . (b) The Subcommittee's legitimate legislative interest was not the activity in which petitioner might have been engaged at the time, but in the manipulation and infiltration of activities and organizations by persons advocating the overthrow of the Government.  Pp.   365 U. S. 414 -415. 272 F.2d 783 affirmed."

He did not claim his privilege against self-incrimination, but contended that the questions were not pertinent to a question under inquiry by the Subcommittee, and that its questioning violated his rights under the First Amendment.  For refusing to answer, he was convicted of a violation of 2 U.S.C. § 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned as a witness by either House of Congress or a committee thereof to refuse to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry. Held:   Petitioner's conviction is sustained.  Pp.   365 U. S. 432 -438. 1. On the record, the subjects under investigation by the Subcommittee when petitioner was interrogated were Communist infiltration into basic southern industries and Communist Party propaganda activities in the South; the Subcommittee's investigation of these subjects was authorized by Congress; the interrogation was pertinent to a question under Subcommittee inquiry; and petitioner was fully apprised of its pertinency.

In hearings by that Committee on his application for admission to the Bar, petitioner refused to answer any questions pertaining to his membership in the Communist Party, not on the ground of possible self-incrimination, but on the ground that such inquiries were beyond the purview of the Committee's authority and infringed rights of free thought, association and expression assured him under the State and Federal Constitutions.  The Committee declined to certify him as qualified for admission to the Bar on the ground that his refusals to answer had obstructed a full investigation into his qualifications.  The State Supreme Court denied him admission to practice. Held:   Denial of petitioner's application for admission to the Bar on this ground did not violate his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   366 U. S. 37 -56.

Maryland No. 8 Argued December 8, 1960 Decided May 29, 1961 366 U.S. 420 APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND
 Syllabus   Appellants, employees of a large department store on a highway in Anne Arundel County, Md., were convicted and fined in a Maryland State Court for selling on Sunday a loose-leaf binder, a can of floor wax, a stapler, staples and a toy, in violation of Md.Ann.Code, Art. 27, § 521, which generally prohibits the sale on Sunday of all merchandise except the retail sale of tobacco products, confectioneries, milk, bread, fruit, gasoline, oils, greases, drugs, medicines, newspapers and periodicals.  Recent amendments now except from the prohibition the retail sale in Anne Arundel County of all foodstuffs, automobile and boating accessories, flowers, toilet goods, hospital supplies and souvenirs, and exempt entirely any retail establishment in that County which employs not more than one person other than the owner. There are many other Maryland laws which prohibit specific activities on Sundays or limit them to certain hours, places or conditions. Held:   Art. 27, § 521 does not violate the Equal Protection or Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or constitute a law respecting an establishment of religion, within the meaning of the First Amendment, which is made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   366 U. S. 422 -453. 1. Art. 27, § 521 does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   366 U. S. 425 -428. (a) On the record in this case, it cannot be said that the classifications made by the statute are without rational and substantial relation to the objects of the legislation, so as to exceed the wide discretion permitted the States in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently from others.  Pp.   366 U. S. 425 -427. (b) Provisions of the statute which permit only certain Anne Arundel County retailers to sell merchandise essential to, or customarily sold at, or incidental to, the operation of bathing beaches, amusement parks, etc., do not discriminate invidiously against retailers in other Maryland counties.  P.   366 U. S. 427 . (c) The Equal Protection Clause is not violated by Art . 27, § 509, which permits only certain merchants in Anne Arundel County (operators of bathing beaches, amusement parks, etc.)   to sell merchandise customarily sold at such places while forbidding its sale by other vendors, such as appellants' employer.  Pp.   366 U. S. 427 -428. 2. Art. 27, § 509, which exempts retail sales of ""merchandise essential to, or customarily sold at, or incidental to, the operation of"" bathing beaches, amusement parks, etc., is not so vague as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   366 U. S. 428 -429. 3. Art. 27, § 521 is not a law respecting an establishment of religion, within the meaning of the First Amendment.  Pp.   366 U. S. 429 -453. (a) Since appellants allege only economic injury to themselves, and do not allege any infringement of their own religious freedoms, they have no standing to raise the question whether the statute prohibits the free exercise of religion, contrary to the First Amendment.  Pp.   366 U. S. 429 -430. (b) Since appellants have suffered direct economic injury, allegedly due to the imposition on them of the tenets of the Christian religion, they have standing to complain that the statute is a law respecting an establishment of religion.  Pp.   366 U. S. 430 -431. (c) In the light of the evolution of our Sunday Closing Laws through the centuries, and of their more or less recent emphasis upon secular considerations, it is concluded that, as presently written and administered, most of them, at least, are of a secular, rather than of a religious, character, and that presently they bear no relationship to establishment of religion, as those words are used in the Constitution of the United States.  Pp.   366 U. S. 431 -444. (d) The present purpose and effect of most of our Sunday Closing Laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens, and the fact that this day is Sunday, a day of particular significance for the dominant Christian sects, does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals.  Pp.   366 U. S. 444 -445. (e) After engaging in the close scrutiny demanded of it when First Amendment liberties are at issue, this Court accepts the determination of the State Supreme Court that the present purpose and effect of the statute here involved is not to aid religion, but to set aside a day of rest and recreation.  Pp.   366 U. S. 445 -449. (f) This Court rejects appellants' contention that the State has other means at its disposal to accomplish its secular purpose that would not even remotely or incidentally give state aid to religion.  Pp.   366 U. S. 449 -453. 220 Md. 117, 151 A.2d 156, affirmed. "

 Syllabus   Appellants are members of the Orthodox Jewish Faith, which requires the closing of their places of business and total abstention from all manner of work from nightfall each Friday until nightfall each Saturday.  As merchants engaged in the retail sale of clothing and home furnishings in Philadelphia, they sued to enjoin enforcement of a 1959 Pennsylvania criminal statute which forbade the retail sale on Sundays of those commodities and other specified commodities.  They claimed that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and constituted a law respecting an establishment of religion, and that it interfered with the free exercise of their religion by imposing serious economic disadvantages upon them if they adhere to the observance of their Sabbath, and that it would operate so as to hinder the Orthodox .Jewish Faith in gaining new members.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   After very extensive hearings under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, the Board, in 1953, found that the Communist Party of the United States was a ""Communist action organization,"" within the meaning of the Act, and ordered it to register as such under § 7.  A remand of the case by this Court,  351 U. S. 115 , and a second remand by the Court of Appeals led to further proceedings before the Board, involving rulings on additional procedural points and two reconsiderations of the entire record, following which the Board adhered to its conclusion.  After denial of motions made by the Party under § 14(a) and after review on the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's order Held:   The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.   367 U. S. 4 -115. 1. Certain procedural rulings made by the Board and the Court of Appeals do not constitute prejudicial errors requiring that this proceeding be remanded to the Board again.  Pp.   367 U. S. 22 -35. (a) A witness having been cross-examined at length following his direct testimony during the initial hearing, and the Board having stricken his testimony on two subjects about which recording of interviews with him were discovered and produced after remand of the case, it cannot be said on this record that the Board abused its discretion in refusing to strike all of his testimony because ill   health prevented him from submitting to further cross-examination, when the Court of Appeals sustained the Board's ruling.  Pp.   367 U. S. 22 -29. (b) By failing to raise the question in its previous petition for certiorari in this Court, the Party abandoned its claim of error in the Board's denial of its motion to require production of certain memoranda prepared by a government witness, and the Party could not resurrect that claim by repeating the motion before the Board after this Court's remand of the case.  Pp.   367 U. S. 29 -32. (c) It cannot be said that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in denying as untimely motions made by the Party under § 14(a) more than 5 years after termination of the initial hearings for orders requiring production of documents in connection with the testimony of government witnesses.  Pp.   367 U. S. 32 -35. 2. The Board and the Court of Appeals did not err in their construction of the Act or in their application of it to the Party on this record.  Pp.   367 U. S. 35 -69. (a) In concluding that the Party was ""substantially directed, dominated, or controlled"" by the Soviet Union, within the meaning of § 3(3), the Board and the Court of Appeals did not err either in their construction of the Act or in finding that the facts shown by the record bring the Party within it.  Pp.   367 U. S. 36 -55. (b) In concluding that the Party ""operates primarily to advance the objectives of [the] . . . world Communist movement"" within the meaning of § 3(3), the Board and the Court of Appeals did not err either in their construction of the Act or in finding that the facts shown by this record bring the Party within it.  Pp.   367 U. S. 55 -56. (c) The Board did not misinterpret or misapply the requirement of § 13(e) that, in determining whether any organization is a Communist action organization, it shall ""take into consideration"" the ""extent to which"" such organization engages in certain classes of conduct specified therein; nor did it abuse its discretion in its rulings on the admissibility of evidence and objections to questions asked on cross-examination in this connection.  Pp.   367 U. S. 56 -66. (d) The action of the Court of Appeals in striking one subsidiary finding of the Board did not require another remand of the proceedings to the Board.  Pp.   367 U. S. 66 -67. (e) Though the Board's description of ""the world Communist movement"" to which its findings related the Party did not   duplicate in all details the description contained in § 2 of the Act, it was the one meant by Congress.  Pp.   367 U. S. 68 -69. (f) The Board and the court below did not err in relying on evidence of the conduct in which the Party engaged prior to the enactment of the Act to support their conclusion that it is presently a Communist action organization.  P.   367 U. S. 69 . (g) The Court of Appeals having thrice examined the evidence adduced before the Board and having held that the Board's conclusions were supported by a preponderance of the evidence, this Court will not make an independent reappraisal of the evidence.  P.   367 U. S. 69 . 3. Since the only action taken so far against the Party under the Act was to order it to register under § 7, and the consequences which will ensue when the order becomes final depend upon actions to be taken thereafter, the only constitutional issues now properly before this Court pertain to the constitutionality of the registration requirement, as applied in this proceeding.  Issues raised as to the constitutionality of other provisions of the Act purporting to regulate or prohibit conduct of registered organizations and their members or otherwise affecting their rights were prematurely raised, and will not be considered at this time.   Electric Bond & Share Co. v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n,   303 U. S. 419 .  Pp.   367 U. S. 70 -81. 4. Notwithstanding the possible consequences of registration, the registration requirements of § 7 do not constitute a bill of attainder within the meaning of Art. I, § 9, cl. 3 of the Constitution.  Pp.   367 U. S. 82 -88. 5. The registration requirements of § 7 (including the listing of the names, aliases and addresses of the foreign-dominated organization's officers and members and the listing of all printing presses in the possession and control of the organization or its members), as here applied, do not constitute a restraint of freedom of expression and association in violation of the First Amendment.   NAACP v. Alabama,   357 U. S. 449 ;  Bates v. Little Rock,   361 U. S. 516 ;  Shelton v. Tucker,   364 U. S. 479 , distinguished.  Pp.   367 U. S. 88 -105. 6. The claim that the provisions of § 7 requiring officers of the Party to sign and file registration statements for it subjects them to self-incrimination forbidden by the Fifth Amendment is raised prematurely, and will not be considered at this time.  Pp.   367 U. S. 105 -110. 7. The Act does not offend the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by predetermining legislatively facts upon which the   application of the registration requirements to the Communist Party depends.  Pp.   367 U. S. 110 -115. 107 U.S. App.D.C. 279, 277 F.2d 78, affirmed. MR JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court. This is a proceeding pursuant to § 14(a) of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1,950 to review an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board requiring the Communist Party of the United States to register as a Communist action organization under § 7 of the Act.  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has affirmed the Board's registration order.  Because important questions of construction and constitutionality of the statute were raised by the Party's petition for certiorari, we brought the case here.   361 U. S. 951 . The Subversive Activities Control Act is Title I of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 987, 50 U.S.C. 781  et seq.   It has been amended, principally by the Communist Control Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 775, and certain of its provisions have been carried forward in sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act adopted in 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182, 1251, 1424, 1451.  A brief outline of its structure, in pertinent part, will frame the issues for decision  Section 2 of the Act recites legislative findings based upon evidence adduced before various congressional committees.  The first of these is: ""There exists a world Communist movement which, in its origins, its development, and its present practice, is a worldwide revolutionary movement whose purpose it is, by treachery, deceit, infiltration into other groups (governmental and otherwise), espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to establish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship in the countries throughout the world through the medium of a worldwide Communist organization."" The characteristics of a ""totalitarian dictatorship,"" as set forth in subsections (2) and (3), are the existence of a single, dictatorial political party substantially identified with the government of the country in which it exists, the suppression of all opposition to the party in power, the subordination of the rights of the individual to the state, and the denial of fundamental rights and liberties characteristic of a representative form of government.  Subsection (4) finds that the direction and control of the ""world Communist movement"" is vested in and exercised by the Communist dictatorship of a foreign country, and subsection (5), that the Communist dictatorship of this foreign country, in furthering the purposes of the world Communist movement, establishes and utilizes in various countries action organizations which are not free and independent organizations, but are sections of a worldwide Communist organization and are controlled, directed, and subject to the discipline of the Communist dictatorship of the same foreign country.  Subsection (6) sets forth that ""The Communist action organizations so established and utilized in various countries, acting under such control, direction, and discipline, endeavor to   carry out the objectives of the world Communist movement by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments by any available means, including force if necessary, and setting up Communist totalitarian dictatorships which will be subservient to the most powerful existing Communist totalitarian dictatorship.  Although such organizations usually designate themselves as political parties, they are, in fact, constituent elements of the worldwide Communist movement and promote the objectives of such movement by conspiratorial and coercive tactics, instead of through the democratic processes of a free elective system or through the freedom-preserving means employed by a political party which operates as an agency by which people govern themselves."" In subsection (7), it is found that the Communist organizations thus described are organized on a secret conspiratorial basis and operate to a substantial extent through ""Communist front"" organizations, in most instances created or used so as to conceal their true character and purpose, with the result that the ""fronts"" are able to obtain support from persons who would not extend their support if they knew the nature of the organizations with which they dealt.  Congress makes other findings:  that the most powerful existing Communist dictatorship has caused the establishment in numerous foreign countries of Communist totalitarian dictatorships, and threatens to establish such dictatorships in still other countries (10); that Communist agents have devised ruthless espionage and sabotage tactics successfully carried out in evasion of existing law (11); that the Communist network in the United States is inspired and controlled in large part by foreign agents who are sent in under various guises (12); that international travel is prerequisite for the carrying on of activities in furtherance of the Communist movement's purposes (8); that Communists   have infiltrated the United States by procuring naturalization for disloyal aliens (14); that, under our present immigration laws, many deportable aliens of the subversive, criminal or immoral classes are free to roam the country without supervision or control (13).  Subsection (9) finds that, in the United States, individuals who knowingly participate in the world Communist movement in effect transfer their allegiance to the foreign country in which is vested the direction and control of the world Communist movement.  Finally, in § 2(15), Congress concludes that ""The Communist movement in the United States is an organization numbering thousands of adherents, rigidly and ruthlessly disciplined.  Awaiting and seeking to advance a moment when the United States may be so far extended by foreign engagements, so far divided in counsel, or so far in industrial or financial straits that overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence may seem possible of achievement, it seeks converts far and wide by an extensive system of schooling and indoctrination.  Such preparations by Communist organizations in other countries have aided in supplanting existing governments.  The Communist organization in the United States, pursuing its stated objectives, the recent successes of Communist methods in other countries, and the nature and control of the world Communist movement itself, present a clear and present danger to the security of the United States and to the existence of free American institutions, and make it necessary that Congress, in order to provide for the common defense, to preserve the sovereignty of the United States as an independent nation, and to guarantee to each State a republican form of government, enact appropriate legislation recognizing the existence of such worldwide conspiracy   and designed to prevent it from accomplishing its purpose in the United States."" Pursuant to these findings, § 7(a) of the Act requires the registration with the Attorney General, on a form prescribed by him by regulations, of all Communist action organizations.  A Communist action organization is defined by § 3(3) as ""(a) any organization in the United States (other than a diplomatic representative or mission of a foreign government accredited as such by the Department of State) which (i) is substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in section 2 of this title, and (ii) operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement as referred to in section 2 of this title; and"" ""(b) any section, branch, fraction, or cell of any organization defined in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph which has not complied with the registration requirements of this title."" Registration must be made within thirty days after the enactment of the Act, or, in the case of an organization which becomes a Communist action organization after enactment, within thirty days of the date upon which it becomes such an organization; in the case of an organization which is ordered to register by the Subversive Activities Control Board, registration must take place within thirty days of the date upon which the Board's order becomes final.  § 7(c).  Registration is to be accompanied by a registration statement, which must contain the name of the organization and the address of its principal office; the names and addresses of its present officers and of individuals who have been its officers within the past twelve months, with a designation of the office held   by each and a brief statement of the functions and duties of each; an accounting of all moneys received and expended by the organization during the past twelve months, including the sources from which the moneys were received and the purposes for which they were expended; the name and address of each individual who was a member during the past twelve months; in the case of any officer or member required to be listed and who uses or has used more than one name, each name by which he is or has been known, and a listing of all printing presses and machines and all printing devices which are in the possession, custody, ownership, or control of the organization or its officers, members, affiliates, associates, or groups in which it or its officers or members have an interest.  § 7(d).  Once an organization has registered, it must file an annual report containing the same information as is required in the registration statement.  § 7(e).  A registered Communist action organization must keep accurate records and accounts of all moneys received and expended, and of the names and addresses of its members and of persons who actively participate in its activities.  § 7(f). Section 7(b) requires the registration of Communist front organizations, defined as those substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by a Communist action organization and primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to a Communist action organization, a Communist foreign government, or the world Communist movement.  § 3(4).  The procedures and requirements of registration for Communist fronts are identical with those for Communist action organizations, except that fronts need not list their non-officer members. [ Footnote 1 ]  In case of the failure of any organization to   register, or to file a registration statement or annual report as required by the Act, it becomes the duty of the executive officer, the secretary, and such other officers of the organization as the Attorney General by regulations prescribes, to register for the organization or to file the statement or report.  § 7(h).  Any individual who is or becomes a member of a registered Communist action organization which he knows to be registered as such but to have failed to list his name as a member is required to register himself within sixty days after he obtains such knowledge, and any individual who is or becomes a member of an organization concerning which there is in effect a final order of the Subversive Activities Control Board requiring that it register as a Communist action organization,   but which has not so registered although more than thirty days have elapsed since the order became final, is required to register himself within thirty days of becoming a member or within sixty days after the registration order becomes final, whichever is later.  § 8.  Criminal penalties are imposed upon organizations, officers and individuals who fail to register or to file statements as required:  fine of not more than $10,000 for each offense by an organization; fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years or both for each offense by an officer or individual; each day of failure to register constituting a separate offense.  Individuals who, in a registration statement or annual report, willfully make any false statement or willfully omit any fact required to be stated or which is necessary to make any information given not misleading are subject to a like penalty.  § 15. The Attorney General is required by § 9 to keep in the Department of Justice separate registers of Communist action and Communist front organizations containing the names and addresses of such organizations, their registration statements and annual reports, and, in the case of Communist action organizations, the registration statements of individual members.  These registers are to be open for public inspection.  The Attorney General must submit a yearly report to the President and to Congress including the names and addresses of registered organizations and their listed members.  He is required to publish in the Federal Register the fact that any organization has registered as a Communist action or Communist front organization, and such publication constitutes notice to all members of the registration of the organization. Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any organization which has not registered is an organization of a kind required to register, or that any individual who has not registered is required to register, he shall petition the Subversive Activities Control Board   for an order that the organization or individual register in the manner provided by the Act. §§ 12, 13(a).  Any organization or any individual registered, or any individual listed in any registration statement who denies that he holds office or membership in the registered organization and whom the Attorney General, upon proper request, has failed to strike from the register, may, pursuant to designated procedures, file with the Subversive Activities Control Board a petition for cancellation of registration or other appropriate relief.  § 13(b). The Board, whose organization and procedure are prescribed, §§ 12, 13(d), 16, is empowered to hold hearings (which shall be public), to examine witnesses and receive evidence, and to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documents relevant to the matter under inquiry.  § 13(c), (d).  If, after hearing, the Board determines that an organization is a Communist action or a Communist front organization or that an individual is a member of a Communist action organization, it shall make a report in writing and shall issue an order requiring the organization or individual to register or denying its or his petition for relief.  § 13(g), (j).  If the Board determines that an organization is not a Communist action or a Communist front organization or that an individual is not a member of a Communist action organization, it shall make a report in writing and issue an order denying the Attorney General's petition for a registration order, or canceling the registration of the organization or the individual, or striking the name of the individual from a registration statement or annual report, as appropriate.  § 13(h), (i). The party aggrieved by any such order of the Board may obtain review by filing in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia a petition praying that the order be set aside.  The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by the preponderance of the evidence, shall   be conclusive.  If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Board, and the Board may modify its findings as to the facts, and shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by the preponderance of the evidence, shall be conclusive.  The court may enter appropriate orders.  Its judgment and decree shall be final, except that they may be reviewed in this Court on writ of certiorari.  § 14(a).  When an order of the Board requiring the registration of a Communist organization has become final upon the termination of proceedings for judicial review or upon the expiration of the time allowed for institution of such proceedings, the Board shall publish in the Federal Register the fact that its order has become final, and that publication shall constitute notice to all members of the organization that the order has become final.  § § 13(k) , 14(b). Section 13(e) of the Act provides that, ""In determining whether any organization is a 'Communist action organization,' the Board shall take into consideration --"" ""(1) the extent to which its policies are formulated and carried out and its activities performed, pursuant to directives or to effectuate the policies of the foreign government or foreign organization in which is vested, or under the domination or control of which is exercised, the direction and control of the world Communist movement referred to in section 2 of this title; and"" ""(2) the extent to which its views and policies do not deviate from those of such foreign government or foreign organization; and"" ""(3) the extent to which it receives financial or other aid, directly or indirectly, from or at the direction   of such foreign government or foreign organization; and"" ""(4) the extent to which it sends members or representatives to any foreign country for instruction or training in the principles, policies, strategy, or tactics of such world Communist movement; and"" ""(5) the extent to which it reports to such foreign government or foreign organization or to its representatives; and"" ""(6) the extent to which its principal leaders or a substantial number of its members are subject to or recognize the disciplinary power of such foreign government or foreign organization or its representatives; and"" ""(7) the extent to which, for the purpose of concealing foreign direction, domination, or control, or of expediting or promoting its objectives, (i) it fails to disclose, or resists efforts to obtain information as to, its membership (by keeping membership lists in code, by instructing members to refuse to acknowledge membership, or by any other method); (ii) its members refuse to acknowledge membership therein; (iii) it fails to disclose, or resists efforts to obtain information as to, records other than membership lists; (iv) its meetings are secret, and (v) it otherwise operates on a secret basis; and"" ""(8) the extent to which its principal leaders or a substantial number of its members consider the allegiance they owe to the United States as subordinate to their obligations to such foreign government or foreign organization."" Similarly, § 13(f) enumerates a set of evidentiary considerations to guide the inquiry and judgment of the Board in determining whether a given organization is or is not a Communist front organization  When an organization is registered under the Act, or when there is in effect with respect to it a final order of the Board requiring it to register, § 10(1) prohibits it, or any person acting in behalf of it, from transmitting through the mails or by any means or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce any publication which is intended to be, or which it may be reasonably believed is intended to be, circulated or disseminated among two or more persons, unless that publication, and its envelope, wrapper or container, bear the writing:  ""Disseminated by [the name of the organization], a Communist organization.""  Section 10(2) prohibits the organization, or any person acting in its behalf, from broadcasting or causing to be broadcast any matter over any radio or television station unless the matter is preceded by the statement:  ""The following program is sponsored by [the name of the organization], a Communist organization.""

Section 4(f) of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 provides that neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute  per se  a violation of penal provisions of the Act or of any other criminal statute, and the fact of registration of any person as an officer or member of such an organization shall not be received in evidence against the person in any prosecution for violations of   penal provisions of the Act or any other criminal statute.  Section 32 provides: ""If any provision of this title, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining provisions of this title, or the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby."" I This litigation has a long history.  On November 22, 1950, the Attorney General petitioned the Subversive Activities Control Board for an order to require that the Communist Party register as a Communist action organization.  The Party thereupon brought suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking to have the proceedings of the Board enjoined.  A statutory three-judge court denied preliminary relief,  Communist Party of the United States v. McGrath,   96 F. Supp. 47 , but stayed answer and hearings before the Board pending appeal.  After this Court denied a petition for extension of the stay, 340 U.S. 950, the Party abandoned the suit.  Hearings began on April 23, 1951, and ended on July 1, 1952. [ Footnote 5 ]  Twenty-two witnesses for the Attorney General and three for the Party presented oral testimony; 507 exhibits, many of book length, were received; the stenographic record, exclusive of these exhibits, amounted to more than 14,000 pages.  On April 20, 1953, the Board issued its 137-page report concluding that the Party was   a Communist action organization within the meaning of the Subversive Activities Control Act, and its order requiring that the Party register in the manner prescribed by § 7. [ Footnote 6 ]  Pending disposition in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia of the Party's petition for review of the registration order, the Party moved in that court, pursuant to § 14(a), [ Footnote 7 ] for leave to adduce additional evidence which it alleged would show that three witnesses for the Attorney General -- Crouch, Johnson, and Matusow -- had testified perjuriously before the Board.  The Court of Appeals denied the motion and affirmed the order of the Board, one judge dissenting.   Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board,  96 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 223 F.2d 531.  Finding that the Party's allegations of perjury had not been denied by the Attorney General, and concluding that the registration order based on a record impugned by a charge of perjurious testimony on the part of three witnesses whose evidence constituted a not insubstantial portion of the Government's case could not stand, this Court remanded to the Board ""to make certain that [it] bases its findings upon untainted evidence.""   351 U. S. 115 ,   351 U. S. 125 . On remand, the Party filed several motions with the Board seeking to reopen the record for the introduction of additional evidence.  These were denied.  A motion in the Court of Appeals for leave to adduce additional evidence was similarly denied, except that the Board   was granted permission to entertain a motion concerning the Party's offer to show that another of the Attorney General's witnesses, Mrs. Markward, had committed perjury with regard to a specified aspect of her testimony.  The Board granted the Party's motion; hearings were reopened; Mrs. Markward was cross-examined.  Motions by the Party for orders requiring the Government to produce certain documents relevant to the matter of her testimony were denied.  On December 18, 1956, the Board issued its 240-page Modified Report.  It found that Mrs. Markward was a credible witness, made new findings of fact, and, having expunged the testimony of Crouch, Johnson and Matusow, reaffirmed its conclusion that the Party was a Communist action organization and recommended that the Court of Appeals affirm its registration order.  That court, while affirming the Board's actions in other regards, held that the Party was entitled to production of several documents relating to Mrs. Markward's testimony, and remanded.   Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board,  102 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 254 F.2d 314.  The scope of this remand was enlarged by subsequent orders requiring the production of recorded statements made to the F.B.I. by the Attorney General's witness Budenz, the existence of these recordings having become known to government counsel and to the Board only at this time.  These statements related to Budenz' testimony at the original hearings concerning the ""Starobin letter"" and the ""Childs-Weiner conversation.""  Motions pursuant to § 14(a) seeking the production of other government-held documents -- memoranda furnished to the Government by the Attorney General's witness Gitlow, and recordings made by the F.B.I. of interviews with Budenz -- were denied. On second remand, the documents specified by the orders of the Court of Appeals were made available to the Party.  The hearing was reopened before a member of   the Board sitting as an examiner.  When the illness of Budenz made impossible his recall for cross-examination in connection with the documents produced, the examiner denied the Party's motion to strike all of Budenz' testimony, but did strike so much as related to the Starobin and Childs-Weiner matters.  After reevaluating the credibility of Budenz and Markward, and affirming the action of its examiner in striking only that portion of Budenz' testimony which concerned the Starobin letter and the Childs-Weiner conversation, the Board reexamined the record as a whole and issued its Modified Report on Second Remand -- its findings of fact consisting principally of the findings contained in its first Modified Report, with a few deletions -- again concluding that the Communist Party of the United States was a Communist action organization, and again recommending that its order to register be affirmed.  The same panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the order, at the same time denying the Party's motion under § 14(a) for an order requiring production of all statements made by government witnesses and now in the possession of the Government, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 277 F.2d 78, the dissenting judge again dissenting in part.  It is this decision which is now before us for review. II The Communist Party urges, at the outset, that procedural rulings by the Board and the Court of Appeals constitute prejudicial error requiring that this proceeding be remanded to the Board.  Before reaching the statutory and constitutional issues which this case presents, we must consider these rulings. A.  The Board's Refusal to Strike All Testimony of the Witness Budenz.   At the original hearing before the Board, Budenz testified during almost two days on direct examination and five days on cross-examination.  His   testimony fills more than 700 pages.  Of these, eight pages of direct and thirty pages of cross-examination relate to the Starobin letter; two pages of direct and ten pages of cross-examination relate to the Childs-Weiner conversation.  Motions to require production of reports or statements by Budenz to the F.B.I. on these two subjects were denied at that time by the Board.  After this Court's remand, the motions were repeated, and again denied.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the motions on the ground that there did not then appear to be in the possession of the Government any such reports or statements.  Subsequent to the court's remand on other grounds, however, government counsel for the first time discovered in the F.B.I. files mechanical transcriptions of interviews with Budenz concerning the Starobin and Childs-Weiner matters.  Counsel reported this discovery to the Court of Appeals, which thereupon enlarged the scope of remand to require the production of all ""statements,"" as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 3500, made by Budenz to the F.B.I. relating to these matters.  The question of the propriety of these various rulings on the Party's motions for production is not now before us. After an inspection of the F.B.I. recordings  in camera  by a member of the Board sitting as an examiner, excerpts relating to the Starobin letter and Childs-Weiner conversation were furnished to the Party.  The Party sought to recall Budenz for further cross-examination in light of these statements.  Upon receipt of a letter from Budenz' personal physician stating that, because of a serious heart condition, it would imperil Budenz' health to appear, the member-examiner caused an independent physical examination of the witness by a heart specialist.  The specialist confirmed that cross-examination might seriously affect Budenz' health or cause his death, and counsel for the Government and the Party agreed that the witness was unavailable for recall.  The Party then moved that all of   Budenz' testimony be stricken on the grounds that its unreliability was shown by his prior statements and that cross-examination which, with the aid of the recordings produced, might permit the Party to discredit Budenz entirely, had been rendered impossible by delay for which the Government was responsible.  The examiner denied the motion, but granted an alternative motion to strike so much of Budenz' testimony as concerned the Starobin letter and the Childs-Weiner conversation.  The Board and the Court of Appeals have affirmed these rulings.  The Party argues that they are error. The ""Childs-Weiner conversation"" concerns an interview in New York at which Budenz, Childs and Weiner discussed the financing of the Midwest Daily Record, a Party newspaper then edited by Budenz.  At the hearing before the Board, Budenz testified that Childs had asked Weiner if money couldn't be got from abroad, and that Weiner replied that normally it might, but that the channels of communication had been broken for the time being, that perhaps they might be reestablished so that money could come.  Budenz testified that, although it was not definitely stated what Weiner meant by ""abroad,"" Budenz' familiarity with the term as used by Party members led him to believe that it meant ""from Moscow.""  In the recordings produced by the Government made during a series of F.B.I. interviews in 1945, Budenz did not mention this incident, although he did advert to the financing problems of the Daily Record and to trips which he made to New York to seek funds for it.  Asked whether he had seen any indication of funds coming from Russia, Budenz replied: ""The only indication would be is that, in addition to Krumbein as Treasurer, Weiner still maintains a certain general supervisory control over finances."" Budenz explained that Weiner was ""trusted financially,"" and again mentioned that Weiner's being ""a super financial person"" was ""indicative"" of the source of money.  He   did not relate any specific conduct of Weiner's which rendered his status ""indicative.""  In an interview in 1946, as reported in an office memorandum prepared by an F.B.I. agent, Budenz stated that he ""could recall only one instance wherein it was indicated that the Soviet Union might be sending money"":  this was the Childs-Weiner conversation in New York.  Childs had asked Weiner, the memorandum stated, whether he didn't expect a consignment ""from across the sea."" "". . .  Weiner immediately changed the subject matter, indicating that he did not want to discuss the question of transmission of Soviet funds in the presence of Budenz, even though Budenz was a trusted Communist.  Budenz concluded from the remark that was made that funds were actually being sent to this country at that time by the Soviet Union for propaganda purposes."" An F.B.I. document based on an interview with Budenz in 1947 describes the incident as follows: "". . .  Childs suggested that Weiner try to get some money from Moscow to finance the paper.  Weiner stated that he had temporarily lost his contacts in Moscow, hence, he could not do anything."" Finally, in a 1950 interview, as recorded in an office memorandum, Budenz related: "". . .  Childs asked that funds be advanced him by Weiner from the reserve fund [large sums of money held in bank accounts 'in reserve for Moscow' or earmarked for Communist organizations] and Weiner advised that he didn't have any at that time, as his communication system had temporarily broken down.  Budenz took this to mean that Weiner's source of supply was from foreign countries, particularly Russia. "" The ""Starobin letter"" was an alleged communication from Starobin, a Daily Worker correspondent at the United Nations Conference in San Francisco in 1945, which Budenz had opened and of which he had read only a part before it was taken from him and transmitted to certain higher-ups at the Daily Worker.  The letter was purportedly received at about the time of the appearance in a French Communist journal of an article by Jacques Duclos, severely criticizing the reorganization of the Communist Party of the United States as the Communist Political Association under Earl Browder in 1944, a reorganization apparently marked by an ideological shift away from the more revolutionary Marxist-Leninist principles, and toward a doctrine of peaceful Soviet-American coexistence.  At roughly the same time, Budenz was instructed to reprint the Duclos article in the Daily Worker; shortly thereafter, the Communist Political Association was reconstituted as the Communist Party U.S.A.  Browder was ousted, and the Party, in the words of its new national chairman, William Z. Foster, ""suddenly reverted to its basic Communist principles.""  Budenz testified at the hearing that, ""In this letter, Mr. Starobin stated that D. Z. Manuilsky [a Ukrainian delegate to the conference and an important Communist figure] . . . had expressed indignation at the fact that the American Party had not criticized the American leaders, that is, in the government, more severely, and that the American Party should observe more carefully the guidance and the counsel of the French Communists."" The F.B.I. recordings produced pursuant to the remand order of the Court of Appeals show that, in 1945 interviews with the F.B.I., Budenz had spoken of ""private communications sent from Starobin to us,"" in connection with the ideological shift which marked the end of the Browder ""collaborationist"" policy.  He did not then speak specifically of the Starobin letter as he described   it in his testimony.  In response to a question by his F.B.I. examiner, Budenz agreed that Starobin himself was not an important enough figure to inaugurate a change of policy.  This colloquy followed: ""Q. Do you think then that the instructions relative to this change of policy that Starobin and Fields must have received came from the Russian delegation?  Oh, you said maybe Manuilsky, the Ukrainian delegate?  A. Sure, sure, I mean -- after all, they got the atmosphere there.  In fact, I mentioned Manuilsky very much, because definitely he is a figure in the CI."" ""Q. He certainly is.  A. He used to lay down the law like a general, you know, to his troops. . . ."" In 1946, Budenz reported to the F.B.I. that, in a letter from the San Francisco Conference, Starobin advised that ""'the French comrades have the line and the support of the Soviet Union -- and the French comrades blasted Stettinius and the United States Delegation, and therefore Starobin directed that the Party in this country should immediately blast Stettinius and the United States Delegation.'  Budenz stated that, in this letter, Starobin inferred [ sic ] that he and/or his associates at the Conference had conferred with Manuilsky regarding this question, and that the changed policy was predicated upon Manuilsky's instructions, as well as on advice received from French Communists at UNCIO."" Testifying in that same year before the House Committee On Un-American Activities, Budenz quoted the Starobin letter as relating that the French Comrades asserted there should be more of an attack upon Stettinius by the American Communists, and that this was likewise the opinion of Comrade Manuilsky. In ruling on the Party's motion to strike all of Budenz' testimony because of his unavailability for cross-examination   in light of these earlier statements, the Board took account not only of the similarities and variations of the witness' several accounts of the Starobin and Childs-Weiner matters, but also of Budenz' responses under extensive cross-examination on all subjects of his testimony at the initial hearing; of the substantial corroboration of Budenz' testimony by other evidence in the administrative record, and of the failure of the Party to attempt to rebut that testimony, which was specific and detailed.  The Board found that the prior statements produced did not demonstrate, in the context of the ""pertinent circumstances of record,"" that Budenz' Starobin and Childs-Weiner testimony was deliberately false, and also that, assuming  arguendo  such testimony were false, all of Budenz' evidence would not thereby be discredited.  It concluded that ""the fair disposition of the question"" was to strike Budenz' testimony only on the two subjects as to which failure of timely production of prior statements had deprived the Party of effective cross-examination.  The Court of Appeals, independently reviewing the record, affirmed the Board's refusal to strike, finding that the discrepancies among the various versions of the Starobin letter and Childs-Weiner conversation incidents ""are not such as to indicate perjury, much less the habit of perjury essential to be shown to taint all the witness' testimony.""  107 U.S.App.D.C. at 283, 277 F.2d  at 82. The considerations relevant to the Party's contention that all of Budenz' testimony must be expunged are, first, the extent to which his prior statements to the F.B.I., compared with his testimony in the present proceedings, discredit him as a witness and impugn his testimony in its entirety, and, second, the extent to which, on the whole record, it appears that the inability to cross-examine Budenz in light of those prior statements had prejudiced the Party.  These are questions which can best be answered by those entrusted with ascertaining the fact; that   is, the tribunal that conducts the hearing and passes judgment on the reliability of the witness in light of his total testimony and its relation to the more than 14,000 pages, exclusive of exhibits, of the administrative transcript.  Wide discretion would be left to a trial judge, and not less must be left to an agency like the Board in a matter of this kind -- a matter of adjusting the process of inquiry to the exigencies of a particular situation as they appear to administrators immediately acquainted with the course of proceedings.  On this record, we cannot say that both the hearing examiner and the Board abused that discretion, or that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming their rulings.  In saying this, we do not ignore the argument of the Party that the deprivation of its opportunity to cross-examine Budenz on the basis of his prior statements is the ""fault"" of government counsel.  Suffice that we find no basis for overruling the determinations below that the Government is not to be charged with an attempt unfairly to hamper the Party's presentation of its case.  We would not, therefore, be justified in holding that evidence should have been struck which the Board found otherwise probative, inherently believable, and not discredited despite five days of cross-examination by the Party, and which the Court of Appeals found unexceptionable. B.  The Board's Refusal to Order Production of the Gitlow Memoranda.   In 1940, Gitlow, who had been, during the years prior to 1929, a high official of the Communist Party, turned over to the F.B.I. a quantity of documents and papers pertaining to the Party.  Shortly thereafter, he dictated a series of memoranda explaining and interpreting them.  At the original hearing in the present proceeding, Gitlow, testifying for the Attorney General, identified a number of these documents, which were then put in evidence, and described their contents and significance.  The Party moved the Board for an order requiring that the   Attorney General produce the explanatory memoranda.  The motion was denied.  In its first petition in the Court of Appeals to review the order of the Board, the Party assigned the Board's refusal to order the production of documentary evidence as error, but it did not mention the Gitlow memoranda in the argument portion of its brief, nor, apparently, in oral argument.  The point was not among the questions presented in the petition for certiorari in this Court in 1955, and was not relied on in the briefs here.  After our remand, the Party again moved the Board to order production of the memoranda.  The Board again refused.  The Court of Appeals, in its second opinion reviewing the Board proceedings, held that the ruling by the Board declining to order production could not be corrected on petition to review the Board's order.  Relying on  Consolidated Edison Co. v. Labor Board,   305 U. S. 197 , the court said that the Party's exclusive remedy was to move the Court of Appeals, under § 14(a) of the Act, for leave to adduce additional evidence, and that failure to make such a motion at the time when the Board refused to order the documents produced barred the Party from later challenging the action of the Board.  After the second remand, the Party did make a motion pursuant to § 14(a) seeking the Gitlow memoranda.  This the court refused, holding that the Party's procedural error could not be cured  nunc pro tunc. We may assume  arguendo,  without deciding the point, that the Board erred in refusing to order the Gitlow memoranda produced at the original hearing.  But we do not reach the question of the applicability of the  Consolidated Edison  case to this situation.  It is too late now for the Party to raise this error of the Board.  That error could have been raised here five years ago.  Had it been raised then, we could have ordered it cured at the time of the first remand to the Board.  The demands not only of orderly procedure, but of due procedure as the means of   achieving justice according to law, require that, when a case is brought here for review of administrative action, all the rulings of the agency upon which the party seeks reversal, and which are then available to him, be presented.  Otherwise we would be promoting the ""sporting theory"" of justice, at the potential cost of substantial expenditures of agency time.  To allow counsel to withhold in this Court and save for a later stage procedural error would tend to foist upon the Court constitutional decisions which could have been avoided had those errors been invoked earlier. [ Footnote 8 ]  We hold that the Communist   Party abandoned its claim of error in the Board's denial of its motion to require the Gitlow documents produced by failing to raise that question in its previous petition for certiorari here.  Of course, it could not resurrect that claim by repeating the same motion before the Board after our remand. C.  Denial by the Court of Appeals of the Party's Motions for Orders Requiring Production of All Statements by the Witness Budenz, and of All Statements by All Witnesses for the Attorney General.   On February 14, 1958, after this case had been remanded to the Board for the second time and more than five and a half years after the termination of the initial hearings, the Party moved the Court of Appeals, under § 14(a), for an order requiring production of all recordings, notes and memoranda made by the F.B.I. of interviews with Budenz insofar as these related to his testimony at the hearings.  On April 14, 1959, after the Board had considered the record for the third time and written its third opinion, the Party filed a second motion in the Court of Appeals, seeking production of all statements by all government witnesses   relating to their testimony.  A motion of similar scope had been made before the Board on second remand in December, 1958.  The court denied these motions as untimely.  We cannot say that, in doing so, it abused its discretion. With reference to the Budenz records, the Party seeks to excuse its delay by pointing out that not until early in February, 1958, did it discover that the F.B.I. had made mechanical transcriptions of interviews with this witness.  The Party was misled, it argues, at the time of the original Board hearings, into believing that no prior statements by Budenz were in the possession of the Government.  The short answer to this may be found in the transcript of Budenz' replies to questions of counsel for the Party during his testimony on cross-examination. [ Footnote 9 ]    Although the Party might not have known of the disc recordings made of the Budenz interviews, it knew that notes or records had been taken of those interviews by the F.B.I.  Indeed, the Party sought production of such reports, insofar as they related to the Starobin letter and the Childs-Weiner conversation, by motions made to the Board at the time Budenz testified.  Had similar motions been made with regard to other aspects of Budenz' testimony, or with regard to other witnesses, and had the Board denied those motions, this issue could have been brought here on review five years ago. [ Footnote 10 ]  If production had   been ordered, presumably all statements by Budenz would have been found.  Statements by others, if they existed, would have been found.  We cannot say that the Court of Appeals was clearly wrong in holding that, at the time these motions were made it was too late to remand to the Board and require production of documents in order to reopen cross-examination of witnesses who testified in 1951 and 1952. III We come to the Communist Party's contentions that the Board and the Court of Appeals erred in their construction of the Act and in their application of it, on the facts of this record, to the Party.  It is argued that both elements of the statutory definition of a Communist action organization in § 3(3) of the Act -- what have come in the course of this litigation to be known as the ""control"" and ""objectives"" components -- were misinterpreted below; that the Board misconceived the nature of each of the eight evidentiary considerations directed to its attention by § 13(e) as pertinent to its determination whether an organization is or is not a Communist action organization; that the Board misapplied the phrase ""world Communist movement"" in § 2, and that the Board erred in taking account, as relevant to that determination, of conduct of the Party prior to the date of the Act.  The Court of Appeals is said to have erred in failing to remand to the   Board after striking one of its subsidiary findings as unsupported by the evidence.  Finally, it is contended, the record as a whole does not support by the preponderance of the evidence, as required by § 14(a), the conclusion that the Party is a Communist action organization within the correct meaning of that phrase. A.  The ""Control Component.""   Under § 3(3) of the Act, an organization cannot be found to be a Communist action organization unless it is ""substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement. . . ."" The Party asserts that this requirement is not satisfied by any lesser demonstration than that the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement exercises over the organization an enforceable, coercive power to exact compliance with its demands.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that, in the circumstances of this record, a consistent, undeviating dedication, over an extended period of time, to carrying out the programs of the foreign government or foreign organization, despite significant variations in direction of those programs, was sufficient.  The Subversive Activities Control Board has not, in its reports, articulated any other understanding of the standard, and since its final factual determination was made after the Court of Appeals had put this definitive gloss on § 3(3), we must attribute to it acceptance of the court's interpretation. We agree that substantial direction, domination, or control of one entity by another may exist without the latter's having power, in the event of noncompliance, effectively to enforce obedience to its will.  The issue which the Communist Party tenders as one of construction of statutory language is more sharply drawn in the abstract sphere of words than in the realm of fact.  It is true that the Court of Appeals compendiously expressed   its understanding of the Party's conduct over a course of thirty years, as revealed by this record and as found by the Board, in terms of ""voluntary compliance.""  Opposing this phrase, the Party insists that the statute demands ""enforceable control.""  But neither of these verbalisms was used by Congress, and neither has an invariant content.  Nor has the language of the statute:  ""substantially directed, dominated, or controlled.""  Each of these notions carries meaning only as a situation in human relationships which arises and takes shape in different modes and patterns in the context of different circumstances. The statute, as amended, uses the same phrase three times.  A Communist action organization must be one substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by a foreign government or foreign organization of a designated kind.  A Communist front organization must be one substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by a Communist action organization.  § 3(4).  A Communist-infiltrated organization must be one substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by an individual or individuals engaged in giving aid or support to a Communist action organization, Communist foreign government, or the world Communist movement.  § 3(4)(A).  Variations of this language also occur.  Subsection 13(e)(1) refers to ""the foreign government or foreign organization in which is vested, or under the domination or control of which is exercised, the direction and control of the world Communist movement. . . ."" Section 2(5) relates that the action organizations established by the Communist dictatorship in which is vested the direction and control of the world Communist movement are sections of a worldwide Communist organization and are ""controlled, directed, and subject to the discipline of [that] . . . Communist dictatorship. . . .""  Manifestly, the various relationships among nations, organizations, movements and individuals of which the   Act speaks will take a multiplicity of forms.  A foreign government ""dominates"" or ""controls"" the ""direction"" of the world Communist movement through very different means and in very different ways than one organization ""dominates"" or ""controls"" another, or than an individual ""dominates"" or ""controls"" an organization.  These differences do not deprive the concepts ""domination"" and ""control"" of ample meaning.  Throughout various manifestations, these concepts denote a relationship in which one entity so much holds ascendancy over another that it is predictably certain that the latter will comply with the directions expressed by the former solely by virtue of that relationship, and without reference to the nature and content of the directions.  This is the sense we find in the opinions expounding the decisions of the Court of Appeals.  The reports of the Board evidence a similar understanding. Nothing in the Committee Reports pertinent to the Internal Security Act of 1950, or in what was said by Congressmen in charge of its passage, affords a gloss on ""substantially directed, dominated, or controlled,"" as used in § 3(3).  There is nothing to indicate that Congress meant that phrase to have any arcane, technical meaning.  Its reach is suggested, however, by comparison with a cognate enactment, the so-called Voorhis Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1201, now 18 U.S.C. § 2386, requiring the registration with the Attorney General of,  inter alia,  certain organizations ""subject to foreign control."" [ Footnote 11 ]  Section 1(e) of that Act, 54 Stat. 1202, provided that ""An organization shall be deemed 'subject to foreign control' if (1) it solicits or accepts financial contributions, loans, or support of any kind, directly   or indirectly, from, or is affiliated directly or indirectly with, a foreign government or a political subdivision thereof, or an agent, agency, or instrumentality of a foreign government or political subdivision thereof, or a political party in a foreign country, or an international political organization, or (2) its policies, or any of them, are determined by or at the suggestion of, or in collaboration with, a foreign government or political subdivision thereof, or an agent, agency, or instrumentality of a foreign government or a political subdivision thereof, or a political party in a foreign country, or an international political organization."" The Committee Report on the House bill from which the Subversive Activities Control Act derived indicates that its enactment was occasioned, in part, by the inadequacy of existing legislation.  Although the Voorhis Act had been directed ""against both Nazis and Communists,"" it had ""proved largely ineffective against the latter, due in part to the skill and deceit which the Communists have used in concealing their foreign ties."" H.R.Rep. No. 2980, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 2;  see also  H.R.Rep. No. 1844, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 5.  It is reasonable to infer that Congress intended the registration provisions of the 1950 Act to be applicable, at the very least, to organizations concerning which a showing of ""control"" was made which would have brought the organization under the registration provisions of the Voorhis Act.  And the 1940 Act, by its explicit definitions, did not require what the Party signifies by ""enforceable"" control. The subjection to foreign direction, domination, or control of which § 3(3) speaks is a disposition unerringly to follow the dictates of a designated foreign country or foreign organization, not by the exercise of independent judgment on the intrinsic appeal that those dictates carry, but for the reason that they emanate from that   country or organization.  No more apt term than domination or control could be used to describe such a relationship.  The nature of the circumstances which bind an organization to unwavering compliance may be diverse.  They may consist, of course, of the sort of enforceable power over the organization's members which an employer has over an employee -- the power to compel obedience by threat of discharge.  But they may also consist of other incidents which assure that the organization will unquestioningly adhere to the line of conduct appointed for it.  Some of these incidents are suggested by the evidentiary considerations which Congress has enumerated in § 13(e) of the Act -- foreign financial or other aid whose menaced withdrawal may serve as an instrument of influence, § 13(e)(3); subjection to, or recognition of, personal disciplinary power of the designated foreign organs by the leaders or a substantial number of the members of an organization, § 13(e)(6); obligations in the nature of allegiance owed to those foreign organs by an organization's leaders or a substantial number of its members.  § 13(e)(8).  Other incidents may involve other forces felt by individuals or groups to be compelling:  a recognition of mastery, for example, which makes criticism itself a severe sanction.  The existence of direction, domination, or control in each instance is an issue of particular fact.  The question whether, in the case of a given organization, such a compulsion or impulsion arises from the complex of ties which link it to a foreign government or organization that it will, because of those ties alone, adhere in its conduct to decisions made for it abroad, is one which Congress has committed, in the first instance, to an expert trier of fact.  Since the determination that an organization is or is not a Communist action organization is largely a matter of the working out of legislative policy in multiform situations of potentially great variety, the ""construction"" of   the statute which ensues from its application to particular circumstances by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement is to be given weight by a reviewing court.   Cf. Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc.,   322 U. S. 111 .  Our decision in  Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States,   307 U. S. 125 , is especially apposite here.  The case involved the question whether one communications corporation controlled another for purposes of § 2(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1065, providing that the Federal Communications Commission should not have jurisdiction over any carrier ""engaged in interstate or foreign communication solely through physical connection with the facilities of another carrier not directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by . . . such carrier."" Refusing to set aside an order based on the Commission's finding that the New York Telephone Company controlled the Rochester Telephone Corporation, we said: ""Investing the Commission with the duty of ascertaining 'control' of one company by another, Congress did not imply artificial tests of control.  This is an issue of fact to be determined by the special circumstances of each case.  So long as there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body, it must stand."" Id.  at   307 U. S. 145 -146. While, under § 14(a) of the Subversive Activities Control Act, providing that the findings of the Board as to facts shall be conclusive if supported by the preponderance of the evidence, a stricter standard of reexamination is set than that to which administrative findings are ordinarily subject, we cannot in this case say that the Board -- and, in affirming its order, the Court of Appeals -- have misapplied the Act.  Neither its written report nor the opinion of the court below supports the Party's interpretation of them.  They do not hold, as the Party suggests, that conformity which stems from nothing more than ideological agreement satisfies the requirements of § 3(3).  What they do hold is that ""the definition of a   Communist action organization was not intended by the Congress to be restricted to organizations which are subject to enforceable demands of the Soviet Union. . . .  An organization or a person may be substantially under the direction or domination of another person or organization by voluntary compliance, as well as through compulsion.  This is especially true if voluntary compliance is simultaneous in time with the direction and is undeviating over a period of time and under variations of direction.  If the Soviet Union directs a line of policy and an organization voluntarily follows the direction, the terms of this statutory definition would be met."" 102 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 400, 254 F.2d 314, 319. This must be read in the context of the facts of record in this proceeding.  Since the determinative issue of the meaning of ""substantially directed, dominated, or controlled,"" and the constitutional questions which the construction of this statutory language raises, are to be determined essentially on the basis of the assignment of legal significance to the Board's findings of fact, those findings must be allowed to speak for themselves.  They can neither be summarized nor fairly conveyed in bits and pieces.  Their large scope and critical importance necessitates and justifies burdening this opinion with more extensive quotation than is customary in cases where summaries of the record may more meaningfully be made. The Board wrote: ""The present world Communist movement was first manifested organizationally by the formation in March of 1919 in Moscow, Russia, of the Third Communist International.  As this event is recorded in the  History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  . . . , it was 'on the initiative of the Bolsheviks, headed by Lenin,' that the first Congress of Communist Parties was called in Moscow, the work of which 'was guided by Lenin;' and"" ""[t]hus was   founded an international revolutionary proletarian organization of a new type -- the Communist International -- the Marxist-Leninist International.""

' . . ."" ""A 'statute' of the Comintern insured that it would serve the interests of Russia by providing:  "" ""   The Communist International fully and unreservedly upholds the gains of the great proletarian revolution in Russia, the first victorious socialist revolution in the world's history, and calls upon all workers to follow the same road.  The Communist International makes it its duty to support with all the power at its disposal every Soviet Republic, wherever it may be formed. . . ."" "" *    *    *    *""  ""The Communist International was, in fact, a world Communist Party, organized and controlled as to policies and activities by the Soviet Union, consisting of the various Communist Parties of the countries throughout the world, which constituted its sections.  With headquarters in Moscow, it embodied an elaborate organizational structure, related to implementing the basic strategy and tactics of Marxism-Leninism. . . .  There was no North American Bureau, but the Political Bureau of respondent acted in that capacity, supervising the Communists in Canada, Cuba, Mexico, and others down to the Panama Canal."" ""The Soviet Union was the leader of the Communist International, exercising control over its policies   and activities.  The Communist Party of the Soviet Union had five votes to one each for the other larger Parties in the Executive Committee of the Comintern (ECCI), which respondent in a 1934 resolution acknowledged to be 'the general staff of the world revolutionary movement giving unity and leadership to the Communist Parties of the world.' . . .

Condition No. 11 required an inspection of personnel and the removal of unreliable elements from parliamentary party fractions, and Condition No. 13 required a systematic check of personnel to remove petty bourgeois elements which may have infiltrated a party.

"" *    *    *    *""  ""The oral testimony and official documents of respondent and of the Comintern show that respondent was under the complete control and direction of the Comintern.  Gitlow was a top official of respondent, and, in the late 1920's, a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.  He stated unequivocally that the Comintern controlled all major policies of respondent.  Kornfeder, also a functionary of respondent and who attended the Sixth Congress of the Comintern held in Moscow, corroborated this, stating that he knew of no instance during his experience, which lasted until 1934, when respondent deviated from Comintern instructions.  Nowell, based on personal experience as a member of respondent and personal contact with the Comintern, as well as what he was instructed while attending the Lenin School in Moscow in 1932, stated that the decisions of the Comintern were binding on respondent.  Honig testified to Comintern directives which were carried out by respondent. . .  "" ""Among the specific instances of record, much of which is uncontroverted documentary material, showing the control exercised over respondent by the Comintern were:  a Comintern decision in 1924 which resulted in the amalgamation of various Communist factions in the United States into the single Communist Party; a decision by Joseph Stalin in 1929, adopted by the Comintern, which expelled certain top officials of respondent and designated other individuals as leaders of respondent; advance approval by the Comintern for the holding of Communist Party conventions in the United States; Comintern instructions in 1927 that respondent charge the United States and Great Britain with intervention in Chinese affairs and to attack Chiang Kai-Shek; Comintern decision directing respondent to work for the formation of a farmer-labor party in the United States and a subsequent change directing respondent to go into elections with the Communist Party ticket; and, advance approval by the Comintern of members of respondent who were sent to training schools in Moscow. . . ."" "" *    *    *    *""  ""Respondent makes much of the fact that it 'disaffiliated' from the Communist International in 1940.  There was no dispute that respondent in 1940 announced its disaffiliation for the stated purpose of avoiding registration as a foreign agent under the Voorhis Act of October 17, 1940.  An issue is the effect of the disaffiliation."" "" *    *    *    *""  "". . .  The Browder report makes clear that the disaffiliation was but an expediency to avoid registration under the Voorhis Act, and contains nothing which negatives an intent to continue as before the principle of 'proletarian internationalism.'  Various   passages of Browder's report indicate an intent to end only the 'formal' and 'organizational' connection with the Communist International, but not to alter the preexisting fundamental relationship.  Illustrative of this is that the report states the disaffiliation would not even be considered if it were thought that it would cause the Party to 'waiver' or 'vacillate' in carrying out 'the internationalism founded by Marx and Engels, and brought to its great, historically decisive victories under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin,' and to which 'the life of every Communist is unconditionally consecrated.' . . .  Also, the Browder report, by characterizing the Voorhis Act as 'an extreme example of the most vicious and oppressive  Exceptional Laws, ' . . . indicates that the organizational disaffiliation was in accord with a Comintern 'Condition' that"" ""[i]n every country where, in consequence of martial law or of other  exceptional laws,  the Communists are unable to carry on their work lawfully, a combination of lawful and unlawful work is absolutely necessary. . . ."" "" *    *    *    *""  ""The 1929 reorganization followed a solution dictated by Stalin, which was adopted by the Comintern, and accepted by respondent. Lovestone, Gitlow, and others were deposed as leaders of respondent and the leadership placed in a group which included William Z. Foster, present national chairman.  The reorganization of respondent was due to a factional dispute which was a reflection of a struggle in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and in the Communist International between forces led by Stalin and those led by Bukharin.  The Foster faction in respondent, representing a minority of only about 10 percent, supported Stalin whereas the Lovestone-Gitlow faction, representing about 90 percent, sided with   Bukharin.  Notwithstanding this, respondent complied with the Stalin-dictated solution.  The record contains no evidence of subsequent material organizational changes until May of 1944, when respondent's name was changed to the Communist Political Association, then changed back in 1945 to the name Communist Party.  The change to 'CPA' was in the year following the dissolution of the Comintern and, like the announcements on that dissolution, the change was assertedly to promote a peaceful coexistence of the United States and the Soviet Union.  While operating under the name 'Communist Political Association,' there was a deemphasis on the more militant principles of Marxism-Leninism and the current publications of the Party put forward the so-called 'Teheran line.'  No evidence was presented by respondent to show a break with the basic principles of the international Communist movement.  The leadership of respondent remained the same."" ""Relevant to the reconstitution of respondent under the name Communist Party, the record shows that, in April of 1945, Jacques Duclos, a spokesman for the world Communist movement, issued a statement the substance and effect of which was that it was a mistake to dissolve the Communist Party of the United States. . . ."" "" *    *    *    *""  ""After preparation throughout the Party, respondent was reconstituted as the Communist Party of the United States of America.

Otherwise those who had been officials and leaders of the CPA and the Party before that, with a few minor exceptions, remained the officers and   leaders of the reconstituted Communist Party.  Upon taking over as national chairman, Foster pointed out the necessity for reemphasizing the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism.  In a report to the reconstitution convention, subsequently published in Political Alairs, Foster declared 'Our Party has suddenly reverted to its basic Communist principles' and 'As never before, we must train our Party in the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism.' . . .""

This is strong evidence that the preexisting relationship between respondent and the Soviet Union continued as before, notwithstanding the formal dissolution of the Comintern by the Soviet Union."" (Original emphasis throughout.) It is on the basis of these detailed findings that the Board and the court below predicated their conclusion that the Communist Party was substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the Soviet Union.  We cannot hold that they erred in the construction of the   statute and in finding that the facts shown bring the Party within it. B.  The ""Objectives Component.""   Section 3(3), defining a Communist action organization, requires a finding that the organization ""operates primarily to advance the objectives of [the] . . . world Communist movement as referred to in section 2 of this title.""  Although asserting that the reference to § 2 is unclear, the Party offered in the Court of Appeals a construction of this requirement which defines the objectives of the world Communist movement as (a) overthrow of existing government by any means necessary, including force and violence, (b) establishment of a Communist totalitarian dictatorship, (c) which will be subservient to the Soviet Union.   See  § 2(1), (2),(3), (6).  We need not now determine whether this interpretation, insofar as it implies that an organization must operate to advance all of these objectives in order to come within the Act, is correct.  Certainly, the elements which the Party has isolated are, singly or collectively, the major ""objectives"" described in § 2.  The Court of Appeals accepted the Party's analysis  arguendo,  and its judgment affirming the order of the Board rests on its conclusion that the Party operates to advance all three of these objectives.  This conclusion is supported by the findings of the Board.  It adopts the interpretation most favorable to the Party. Within the framework of these definitions, the Court of Appeals held sufficient to demonstrate the Communist Party's objective to overthrow existing government the finding of the Board that the Party advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence if necessary.  The Party argues that this finding is inadequate to satisfy the conception of overthrow embodied in § 2(1) and (6); that, under the compulsion of the First Amendment, the Act must be read as reaching only organizations whose purpose to overthrow   existing government is expressed in illegal action or incitement to illegal action; that advocacy of the use of violence ""if necessary"" amounts at most to the promulgation of abstract doctrine, not incitement.  Section 2(1) recites that the purpose of the world Communist movement is, ""by treachery, deceit, infiltration . . espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to establish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship in the countries throughout the world through the medium of a worldwide Communist organization."" Section 2(6) recites that Communist action organizations ""endeavor to carry out the objectives of the world Communist movement by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments by any available means, including force if necessary. . . ."" We think that an organization may be found to operate to advance objectives so defined although it does not incite the present use of force.  Nor does the First Amendment compel any other construction.  The Subversive Activities Control Act is a regulatory, not a prohibitory statute.  It does not make unlawful pursuit of the objectives which § 2 defines.  In this context, the Party misapplies  Yates v. United States,   354 U. S. 298 , and  Dennis v. United States,   341 U. S. 494 , on which it relies.   See Barenblatt v. United States,   360 U. S. 109 ;  Uphaus v. Wyman,   360 U. S. 72 ;  American Communications Assn. v. Douds,   339 U. S. 382 . C.  The Evidentiary Considerations of Section 13(e); the Striking by the Court of Appeals of a Subsidiary Finding Under Section 13(e)(7).   Section 13(e) prescribes that, in determining whether any organization is a Communist action organization, the Board shall take into consideration the extent of its conduct in eight enumerated dimensions.  Accordingly, the Board made basic findings of fact in each, and on them based conclusions.  The Party attacks each conclusion as based upon   a misinterpretation or misapplication of the statutory considerations. As to three of these considerations upon which the Board placed substantial reliance in its determination that the Communist Party is controlled by the Soviet Union and operates primarily to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement -- the extent to which its policies are formulated and carried out and its activities performed pursuant to directives or to effectuate policies of the Soviet Union (§ 13(e)(1)), the extent to which its principal leaders or a substantial number of its members are subject to or recognize the disciplinary power of the Soviet Union (13(e)(6)), and the extent to which its principal leaders or a substantial number of its members consider the allegiance they owe to the United States as subordinate to their obligations to the Soviet Union (13(e)(8)) -- the Party contends that the conclusions of the Board are not supported by its findings of fact.  We have considered the Board's report, and find the Party's contention without merit. As to three other considerations -- the extent to which an organization receives financial or other aid from the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement (§ 13(e)(3)), the extent to which it sends its members to a foreign country for instruction and training in the principles, tactics, etc., of the world Communist movement (§ 13(e)(4)), and the extent to which it reports to the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement (§ 13(e)(5)) -- the Board found, respectively, that the Communist Party had received financial aid from the Soviet Union and the Comintern, and had sent its members to the Soviet Union for training, prior to about 1940, but that there was no evidence that these activities continued after that time and that the Communist Party,   ""upon occasion,"" reports to the Soviet Union.  From a reading of its Modified Report on Second Remand, it does not appear that the Board relied on these three findings to support its ultimate determination; rather, it regarded them as inconclusive, except insofar as Soviet financial aid to the Party during the period before it became a going organization could be considered ""a tile in the mosaic,"" and insofar as foreign-trained Party members themselves served as instructors in Party schools in the United States at later times when there was no evidence of continued foreign training as such.  The Party argues that the Board's findings required it to conclude that evidence pertinent to the considerations of § 13(e)(3), (4), and (5) tended to negate a finding that the Party was foreign-controlled.  We cannot say that the basic findings of the Board compelled that conclusion and precluded its own.  The Board, directed by Congress to consider ""the extent to which"" an organization engages in certain classes of conduct, was not, of course, obligated to make findings in each dimension which would be conclusive of the ultimate issues before it.  It was required only to consider each of these dimensions -- this it has painstakingly done -- and, on the whole record before it, to appraise the probative force of the evidence in each dimension.   See Secretary of Agriculture v. Central Roig Ref. Co.,   338 U. S. 604 ; 96 Cong.Rec. 14530-14534;  cf. id.  at 13764, 15634.  The Board has explained in detail the factors which urged it to take the view it has taken of the evidence concerning financial aid, foreign training and reporting.  We cannot say that, on the basis of all its findings it accorded inadmissible weight to these considerations. By § 13(e)(2), the Board is directed to consider, in determining whether a given organization is a Communist action organization, ""the extent to which its views   and policies do not deviate from those of [the] . . . foreign government or foreign organization"" directing the world Communist movement.  In connection with this consideration, Dr. Philip Mosely, Professor of International Relations at Columbia University and Director of the University's Russian Institute, appeared as an expert witness for the Attorney General.  He enumerated some forty-five major international issues during thirty years with respect to which, his testimony indicated, there had been no substantial difference between the announced positions of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party. [ Footnote 12 ]  As to each issue, documents representative of the respective views of the Soviet and the Party were identified by Dr. Mosely and put into the record as exhibits.  Both the Board and the Court of Appeals credited Dr. Mosely's testimony and placed significant reliance on it in concluding that the Communist Party is substantially dominated by the Soviet Union. The Party urges two contentions relating to this aspect of the case.  The first is that the Mosely evidence has no tendency to prove nondeviation within the meaning of § 13(e)(2) and no rational relevance to the ultimate issue of Soviet domination of the Party, because Dr. Mosely did not establish that, as to each of the international issues concerning which Soviet Union and Party views coincided, the announced Soviet position antedated   that of the Party, [ Footnote 13 ] nor did Dr. Mosely testify that the coincidence of views evidenced parroting of the Soviet position by the Party -- indeed, he expressly declined, as a matter of expert judgment, to draw any inference from the coincidence alone with respect to the reasoning processes by which the Party arrived at its views.  The Party contends that, under § 13(e)(2), the Board was not authorized to consider evidence merely of sameness of policy, but that sameness would become relevant only after the Attorney General had shown that the Party took its position subsequent to, and not independently of, the announced policy of the Soviet.  Second, the Party argues that the Board erred in refusing to let it show, both by cross-examination of Dr. Mosely and by proffered original evidence, that many other, assertedly non-Communist groups and individuals also expressed, contemporaneously with the Soviet Union and the Party, views identical to those in which the two concurred -- and, further, that the views were correct. We do not agree that the Board was not entitled to consider and evaluate evidence of a consistent identity of policies of an organization and the Soviet Union until the Government had shown the temporal antecedence of the Soviet's position and negatived the possibility that independent reasoning processes brought about the identity.  Here, the Board found that the coincidence of policies extended over a vast area of subject matter, was   absolutely invariant during more than thirty years -- the entire life of the Party -- and was unbroken even in the face of sharp reversals in the Soviet's views.  Section 13(e)(2), directing the Board to consider the extent of nondeviation, does not purport to establish a litmus test of domination or control, requiring some fixed minimum level of policy-parroting.  This requirement is satisfied by consideration of whatever is logically relevant in this regard.  Of course, the Government would have established a stronger case had it shown not only identity of views on more than forty issues, but also that the Soviet's view had always led and the Party's always followed, and that the similarity could not conceivably be the result of autonomous application of similar basic philosophical principles.  But this is no reason to say that the Board could not consider, and form its judgment on, the showing that the Government did make in the present proceeding.  Certainly, if the Act contained no § 13(e), Dr. Mosely's testimony would be both relevant and significantly probative with respect to the issue of Soviet domination of the Party.  To hold that § 13(e)(2) makes it a condition precedent to Board consideration of this long-continued, totally unwavering identity of policy lines, that the Attorney General also establish such elusive determinants as the dates of birth of the policies and the ratiocinative processes by which they came into being, we would have to find that, by § 13(e)(2), Congress meant to limit, and severely limit, the evidences of Soviet domination of which the Board could take account.  The structure of § 13(e) will not bear that construction. [ Footnote 14 ]  With respect to the rulings precluding the Party from showing certain facts which would have tended to establish that the views in which it paralleled the Soviet Union were correct views, or were reached independently, or were also held by other persons, we do not think that the Board abused its discretion.  The questions which the Party sought to ask Dr. Mosely on cross-examination relating to the correctness of the Party's views were of two sorts.  The first involved matters of value judgment or opinion, capable of interminable debate but incapable of proof, and which, the Board might reasonably have found, would have added little to the record beyond the witness' personal views. [ Footnote 15 ]  The second sort called for answers of a more   objective kind, but related in general to the truth or falsity of particular, detailed assertions of fact selected out of the various documents which the Attorney General had put in evidence as illustrative of the Party's policies. [ Footnote 16 ]  Since, in testifying as to the nature of those policies, Dr. Mosely had relied on a wide background of study of Party writings, of which the exhibits put into the record were only exemplary, and since, even with reference to those particular exhibits, Dr. Mosely's testimony rested upon an expert analysis of each article read as a whole -- its general tenor, deriving from its use of language, its selection of facts reported, its argumentative and exhortative parts, if any -- litigation of the truth  vel non  of individual statements of fact might well have been regarded by the Board as promising to lead into distracting inquiries regarding marginal or remote issues -- what in a court would constitute  res inter alios acta  -- incommensurate with the materiality of the evidence produced.  Objections to both kinds of questions were, in the Board's discretion, properly sustained.  As for the question which the Party attempted to put to Dr. Mosely concerning approximately half of the   international issues which he discussed, whether, in each case, an informed American observer, in the exercise of independent judgment and sensitive to the best interests of the United States, might not also reasonably have arrived at the view held by the Party and the Soviet, [ Footnote 17 ] the question was not improperly disallowed as beyond the permissible scope of cross-examination.  Dr. Mosely did not purport on direct examination to establish the thought processes or the political processes by which the Soviet and the Party arrived at their positions, but only that the positions were identical.  The Party was permitted to show, and two of its witnesses testified, on both direct and cross-examination, that the policies of the Party were adopted in the autonomously reasoned belief, in each case, that a particular policy was sound and in the best interests of the American people.  The Board, in its modified reports, took account of and evaluated this testimony.  It was not prejudicial that the Party was not allowed to use the Government's expert witness to negative causal connections which his testimony for the Government did not seek to show. The Party also argues that it should have been permitted to demonstrate, by cross-examination of Dr. Mosely and by original evidence, that many other persons than the Soviet and the Party held views similar to those   on which the two agreed.  We cannot hold that the Board erred in excluding these showings.  They took two forms.  First, with respect to some twenty-five international issues, the question was put to Dr. Mosely whether many non-Communist commentators did not also support the view expounded by the Party. [ Footnote 18 ]  A similar question was asked of a witness for the Party concerning one more issue.  Second, with respect to somewhat more than thirty issues, the Party offered to establish, by questioning Dr. Mosely and by documents proffered in evidence, that particular named individuals and groups had concurred in the views of the Party on each individual issue. [ Footnote 19 ]  The most that the Party could have proved, had it been allowed to make the offered showings, was that, on the subject of each specific, isolated one among the forty-five international issues enumerated, a considerable number of persons not Soviet-dominated took positions parallel to those of the Soviet and the Party.  This is only to be expected in the case of issues of this character.  The Party never offered to show, despite wide latitude allowed by the hearing panel in making proffers after similar proffers had been previously disallowed, that a continuing, substantial body of independent groups and persons concurred with the Party on a significant aggregate number   of policies among the forty-five.  Of the particular sources mentioned in the Party's separate questions and offers of proof, the greatest number of issues with reference to which a single source recurs -- the New York Times, or individuals writing in the Times -- is ten or less, and in most cases the agreement shown is with only a portion of the Party's position.  No other source occurs more than roughly half a dozen times; most, two or three times. [ Footnote 20 ]  On the basis of these proffers, the Board's rulings did not amount to an abuse of the discretion which it must be allowed in the conduct of its hearings to avoid opening the sluices to litigation of the views of a multitude of third parties. Section 13(e)(7) requires the Board to consider the extent to which, ""for the purpose of concealing foreign direction, domination, or control, or of expediting or promoting its objectives,"" an organization engages in specified secret practices or otherwise operates on a secret basis.  In its original report, the Board concluded that the Communist Party engages in secret practices for both these purposes.  The Court of Appeals, in its first opinion, held that the finding of secret practices was warranted, but that the Government had not established by the preponderance of the evidence the purpose of the practices.  Although no new evidence on the point was taken on remand, the Board again found in its two modified reports that the purpose of the practices was to promote the objectives of the Communist Party. [ Footnote 21 ]  In its third opinion, the Court of Appeals again held the finding as to purpose   unsupported by the preponderance of the evidence.  Nevertheless, holding that the whole record supported the Board's conclusion that the Communist Party was substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the Soviet Union, it rejected the Party's contention that the striking of this one subsidiary finding as to purpose of secret practices required remand of the proceeding to the Board. We think that the Court of Appeals did not err in refusing to remand the case on that ground.   Cf. Labor Board v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.,   308 U. S. 241 .  In the summaries of its modified reports, the Board did not rely on, or even refer to, the finding of secret practices.  Thus, this case is unlike  Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp.,   318 U. S. 80 , and  Labor Board v. Virginia Electric & Power Co.,   314 U. S. 469 , in which proceedings were remanded to administrative agencies when this Court found unsupportable the grounds upon which the agencies had expressly rested the orders reviewed.  Where a Court of Appeals strikes as not sustained by the evidence a subsidiary administrative finding upon which the agency itself does not purport to rely, it would be an unwarranted exercise of reviewing power to remand for further proceedings.   Labor Board v. Reed & Prince Mfg. Co.,  205 F.2d 131 (C.A. 1st Cir.).  Remand would be called for only if there were a solid reason to believe that, without that subsidiary finding, the agency would not have arrived at the conclusion at which it did arrive.  Reading the modified reports of the Board in the present case -- reports written after the Court of Appeals had once held the finding as to the purpose of the Party's secret practices unsupported -- this Court cannot conclude that the Court of Appeals was wrong in regarding the finding stricken as one to which the Board did not attach weight and which did not influence its determination.  D.  The Board Findings as to the World Communist Movement; Evidence of Past Practices; the Preponderance of the Evidence.   Under the Act, an organization may be found to be a Communist action organization only if the relations specified in the ""control"" and ""objectives"" components of § 3(3) exist between it and the ""world Communist movement referred to in section 2. . . .""  In the present proceeding, the Board, after recognizing that, ""in section 2 of the Act, Congress has found the existence of a world Communist movement and has described its characteristics,"" set forth its own description, based on the evidence presented in this record, of contemporary Communist institutions in their international aspect, and particularly of the role of the Soviet Union in those institutions.  The Party argues that, because this description does not duplicate in all details that of § 2 of the Act, the world Communist movement to which the Board found that the Communist Party bore the required statutory relationship is not the world Communist movement referred to in § 2. But the attributes of the world Communist movement which are detailed in the legislative findings are not in the nature of a requisite category of characteristics comprising a definition of an entity whose existence  vel non  must be established, by proving those characteristics, in each administrative proceeding under the Act.  Congress has itself found that that movement exists.  The legislative description of its nature is not made a subject of litigation for the purpose of ascertaining the status of a particular organization under the Act.  The Attorney General need not prove, in the case of each organization against whom a petition for a registration order is filed, that the international institutions to which the organization can be shown to be related fit the picture in every precise detail set forth in § 2.  The only question, once an organization   is found to have certain international relations, is one of statutory interpretation -- of identifying the statutory referent.  Are the institutions involved in those relations the ""world Communist movement"" to which Congress referred?  We are satisfied from the Board's report that the ""world Communist movement"" to which its findings related the Communist Party was the same ""world Communist movement"" meant by Congress. The Party contends that the Board and the court below erred in relying on evidence of conduct in which it engaged prior to the enactment of the Act to support their conclusion that it is presently a Communist action organization.  This must be rejected.  Where the current character of an organization and the nature of its connections with others is at issue, of course, past conduct is pertinent.  Institutions, like other organisms, are predominantly what their past has made them.  History provides the illuminating context within which the implications of present conduct may be known. Finally, the Party asks that we reexamine the evidence adduced before the Board and review the Board's findings of fact.  The Court of Appeals, made thoroughly familiar with this record by three such reexaminations, has held that the Board's conclusions, as expressed in its Modified Report on Second Remand, are supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  We see no reason why still another court should independently reappraise the record.  We have declined to do this in the case of other agencies as to whom reviewing power on the facts has been vested in the Courts of Appeals, and we find no purpose to be served in departing now from this settled policy of appellate review.   Labor Board v. Pittsburgh Steamship Co.,   340 U. S. 498 ;  Labor Board v. American National Ins. Co.,   343 U. S. 395 ;  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Standard Oil Co.,   355 U. S. 396 .  IV The Party's constitutional attack on the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 assails virtually every provision of this extended and intricate regulatory statute.  The registration requirement of § 7, by demanding self-subjection to what may be deemed a defamatory characterization and, in addition, disclosure of the identity of all rank-and-file members, is said to abridge the First Amendment rights of free expression and association of the Communist Party and its adherents.   See NAACP v. Alabama,   357 U. S. 449 ;  Bates v. Little Rock,   361 U. S. 516 ;  cf. Thomas v. Collins,   323 U. S. 516 ;  Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath,   341 U. S. 123 .  The Party's officers, it is asserted, who by filing a registration statement in its behalf evidence their status as active members of the Party, are required to incriminate themselves in violation of the Fifth Amendment, as are the individual members who must register themselves under § 8 if the Party fails to register or fails to list them.   Cf. Blau v. United States,   340 U. S. 159 ;  Quinn v. United States,   349 U. S. 155 .  The provision that Communist organizations label their publications is attacked as a prior restraint on, and such sanctions as denial of tax exemption are attacked as a penalty on the exercise of, the Party's constitutionally protected freedom of speech.   Cf. Talley v. California,   362 U. S. 60 ;  Speiser v. Randall,   357 U. S. 513 .  The various consequences of the Party's registration for its individual members -- prohibition of application for and use of passports, disqualification from government or defense facility employment, disqualification from naturalization, subjection to denaturalization, proscription of officership or employment in labor organizations -- are said to deny those members due process of law by, in effect, attainting them by association,  cf. De Jonge v. Oregon,   299 U. S. 353 ;  Wieman v. Updegraff,   344 U. S. 183 , and by subjecting   them to potential criminal proceedings in which the nature of the organization, membership in which is an element of various offenses, may not be judicially tried.  Many of the statute's provisions are challenged as unconstitutionally vague, and it is said that the establishment of an agency, the Subversive Activities Control Board, whose continued existence depends upon its finding the Communist Party a Communist action organization within the meaning of the Act, necessarily biases the agency and deprives the Party of a fair hearing.  In fact, the Party asserts, the statute as written so particularly designates the Communist Party as the organization at which it is aimed that it constitutes an abolition of the Party by legislative fiat, in the nature of a bill of attainder.  The provisions must be read as a whole, it is said, and, when so read, they are seen to envisage not the registration and regulation of the Party, but the imposition of impossible requirements whose only purpose is to lay a foundation for criminal prosecution of the Party and its officers and members, in effect ""outlawing"" the Party. Many of these questions are prematurely raised in this litigation.  Merely potential impairment of constitutional rights under a statute does not of itself create a justiciable controversy in which the nature and extent of those rights may be litigated.   United Public Workers v. Mitchell,   330 U. S. 75 ;  International Longshoremen's Union v. Boyd,   347 U. S. 222 .  Even where some of the provisions of a comprehensive legislative enactment are ripe for adjudication, portions of the enactment not immediately involved are not thereby thrown open for a judicial determination of constitutionality. ""Passing upon the possible significance of the manifold provisions of a broad statute in advance of efforts to apply the separate provisions is analogous to rendering an advisory opinion upon a statute or a declaratory judgment upon a hypothetical case."" Watson v. Buck,   313 U. S. 387 ,   313 U. S. 402 .  No rule of practice   of this Court is better settled than ""never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.""   Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S.S. Co. v. Commissioners,   113 U. S. 33 ,   113 U. S. 39 ;  Arizona v. California,   283 U. S. 423 ; Mr. Justice Brandeis, concurring, in  Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority,   297 U. S. 288 ,   297 U. S. 341 .  In part, this principle is based upon the realization that, by the very nature of the judicial process, courts can most wisely determine issues precisely defined by the confining circumstances of particular situations.   See Parker v. County of Los Angeles,   338 U. S. 327 ;  Rescue Army v. Municipal Court,   331 U. S. 549 .  In part, it represents a conception of the role of the judiciary in a government premised upon a separation of powers, a role which precludes interference by courts with legislative and executive functions which have not yet proceeded so far as to affect individual interests adversely.   See  the Note to  Hayburn's Case ,  2 Dall. 409;  Massachusetts v. Mellon,   262 U. S. 447 .  These considerations, crucial as they are to this Court's power and obligation in constitutional cases, require that we delimit at the outset the issues which are properly before us in the present litigation. This proceeding was brought by the Attorney General under § 13(a) of the Subversive Activities Control Act, seeking an order of the Board that the Communist Party register as a Communist action organization pursuant to § 7.  The Board has issued such an order, in accordance with § 13(g)(1) , which is here reviewed, under § 14(a).  The effect of that order is to require the Party to register and to file a registration statement within thirty days after the order becomes final, § 7(c)(3), upon pain of fine up to $10,000 for each day of failure to register.  When the order becomes final, other consequences also ensue, for the Party, for its members and for other persons.  Certain acts of the Party -- distributing its publications   through the mails or through the instrumentalities of interstate or foreign commerce, or causing matter to be broadcast by radio or television, without the required identification -- are prohibited, § 10, and tax exemption is denied it, § 11.  Specified acts of its members --  e.g.,  applying for or using a United States passport, holding government or defense facility employment, holding labor union office or employment -- are forbidden, §§ 5, 6, and those members are definitively subject to certain disqualifications -- if aliens, they may not enter the United States, may be deported, may not be naturalized, may in some circumstances be denaturalized, with qualifications.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1182, 1251, 1424, 1451.  Employment by the Party is not ""employment"" for purposes of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 410; contributions to the Party are not tax deductible, Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, § 11.  Acts by third parties with regard to the Party or its members -- the contributing of funds or services to the Party by government or defense facility personnel, issuance of passports to Party members -- are, under specified circumstances, prohibited, §§ 5, 6.  All of these consequences depend upon action taken subsequent to the time when the registration order becomes final.  Some depend upon action which is, at best, highly contingent. [ Footnote 22 ]  The question is which, if any, of these consequences are now before us for constitutional adjudication, as necessarily involved in the determination of the constitutionality of the Board's registration order. A closely similar issue was presented to this Court in  Electric Bond & Share Co. v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n,   303 U. S. 419 .  That was a statutory suit brought   by the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce against certain utility holding companies the provisions of §§ 4(a) and 5 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 803.  The Act, like the Subversive Activities Control Act, was a statute of many intricate and interlocking sections, with a severability clause.  Its fifth section provided that holding companies, as defined, might register with the Commission and file a registration statement containing specified information:  unless such a company registered within the time fixed, § 4(a) subjected it to what the Court referred to as the ""penalty for failure to register"":  criminal liability for engaging in business in interstate commerce; or for selling, transporting, owning or operating utility assets for the transportation of gas or electricity in interstate commerce; or for using the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to distribute or acquire utility securities, or to negotiate, make, or take any step in performing, service, sales or construction contracts for public utility or holding companies; or for owning, controlling or holding voting stock in any subsidiary engaging in any of these activities. [ Footnote 23 ]  Once a holding company registered, prescribed consequences ensued,   some automatic, [ Footnote 24 ] some requiring the initiation of further proceedings by the Commission.  It was unlawful for any registered holding company or any subsidiary company of a registered holding company to sell or offer for sale any security of the holding company from house to house, or to cause any officer or employee of a subsidiary company to sell such a security; it was unlawful for any registered holding company to borrow or to receive any extension of credit from any public utility company in the same holding company system; it was unlawful for any registered holding company or any subsidiary of such a holding company to make any contribution in connection with the candidacy, nomination, election or appointment of any person for or to any office or position in federal, state or municipal government or to make any contribution to any political party; all contracts made in violation of any provision of the Act were void.  Other transactions of registered companies were prohibited unless approved by the Commission, and, under the ""simplification"" provisions of § 11, the Commission was required to take steps to break up the holding company systems of registered holding companies. The Commission sued for, and the District Court granted, an injunction restraining companies of the Electric Bond and Share system from operating in violation of § 4(a) until they had either registered under § 5 or ceased to be holding companies. [ Footnote 25 ]  A cross-bill by the companies   seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional in its entirety was dismissed.  When the case came here, the companies argued that the scheme of the Act was a single, integrated whole; that the registration sections, which were the mechanism by which holding companies were subjected to the statute's various regulatory provisions, could not be separately considered, and that the unconstitutionality of the regulatory provisions invalidated the registration requirement.  The Court affirmed the decree, but on the basis of a deliberate abstention from consideration of any but the registration section, § 5, as enforced by the sanctions of § 4(a).  Noting that, if the statute's severability clause were given effect, the registration obligation could be validly enforced even though any or all of the ""control"" provisions applicable to registered companies were unconstitutional, and finding in the legislative history nothing to indicate that the various regulatory sections ""were intended to constitute a unitary system, no part of which can fail without destroying the rest,"" 303 U.S. at   303 U. S. 438 -439, the Court declined to decide the broad constitutional questions pressed upon it.  Likewise, the District Court's dismissal of the cross-bill was sustained: "". . .  By the cross-bill, defendants seek a judgment that each and every provision of the Act is unconstitutional.  It presents a variety of hypothetical controversies which may never become real.  We are invited to enter into a speculative inquiry for the purpose of condemning statutory provisions the effect of which in concrete situations, not yet developed,   cannot now be definitely perceived.  We must decline that invitation."" Id.  at   303 U. S. 443 .  Not until eight years later were some of these other related, important questions, at last properly presented, decided. [ Footnote 26 ] The decision in  Electric Bond & Share  controls the present case.  This Act, like the one involved there, has a section directing that, if any of its provisions, or any of its applications, is held invalid, the remaining provisions and other possible applications shall not be affected.  The authoritative legislative history clearly demonstrates that a major purpose of the enactment was to regulate Communist action organizations by means of the public disclosure effected by registration, apart from the other regulatory provisions of the Act. [ Footnote 27 ]  Such is, of course, the very purpose of the severability clause.  This being so, our consideration of any other provisions than those of § 7, requiring Communist action organizations to register and file a registration statement, could in no way affect our decision in the present case.  Were every portion of the Act purporting to regulate or prohibit the conduct of registered organizations (or organizations ordered to register) and of their members, as such, unconstitutional, we would still have to affirm the judgment below.  Expatiation on the validity of those portions would remain mere pronouncements, addressed to future and hypothetical controversies.  This is true with regard to those sections of the Act which prescribe consequences legally enforceable against the Communist Party once a final registration order is in effect against it -- the ""labeling"" and tax exemption denial provisions of §§ 10 and 11.  These   are analogous to the proscription of specified credit transactions, or specified security sales, or specified political contributions, by the Public Utility Holding Company Act considered in  Electric Bod & Share.   Although they become operative as soon as a registration order is made final, their application remains in a very real sense problematical.  We cannot now foresee what effect, if any, upon the Party the denial of tax exemption will have.  We do not know whether the Party now has, or whether it will have at any time after a Board order goes into effect, any taxable income, or, indeed, any income whatever.  We do not know that, after such an order is in effect, the Party will wish to utilize the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for the circulation of its publications.  We cannot guess the nature of whatever publications it may wish to circulate or their relation to the purposes and functions of the Party.  These circumstances may be critical for constitutional determination.  It will not do to discount their significance by saying, now that no difference in circumstances will effect a different constitutional result -- that the principles relevant to a determination of the validity of these statutory provisions do not depend upon the variations in circumstances in which they are potentially applicable.  For this analysis presupposes that we now understand what are the relevant constitutional principles, whereas the reason of postponing decision until a constitutional issue is more clearly focused by, and receives the impact from, occurrence in particular circumstances is precisely that those circumstances may reveal relevancies that abstract, prospective supposition may not see or adequately assess. These considerations are equally appropriate in the case of those sections of the Act which proscribe specified conduct by members of an organization concerning which a final registration order is in effect, or which impose obligations upon them, or which subject them to described   disabilities under certain circumstances.  It is wholly speculative now to foreshadow whether, or under what conditions, a member of the Party may in the future apply for a passport, or seek government or defense facility or labor union employment, or, being an alien, become a party to a naturalization or a denaturalization proceeding.  None of these things may happen.  If they do, appropriate administrative and judicial procedures will be available to test the constitutionality of applications of particular sections of the Act to particular persons in particular situations.  Nothing justifies previsioning those issues now. But the Party argues that the threat, however indefinite, of future application of these provisions to penalize individuals who are or become its members, affiliates or contributors, will effectively deter persons from associating with it or from aiding and supporting it.  Thus, the provisions exercise a present effect upon the Party sufficiently prejudicial to justify its challenging them in this proceeding.  In support of this contention, the Party cites cases in which we have held that litigants had ""standing"" to attack a statute or regulation which operated to coerce other persons to withdraw from profitable relations or associations with the litigants.   See, e.g., Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath,   341 U. S. 123 ;  Pierce v. Society of Sisters,   268 U. S. 510 ;  Buchanan v. Warley,   245 U. S. 60 ;  Truax v. Raich,   239 U. S. 33 ;  cf. NAACP v. Alabama,   357 U. S. 449 ;  Bates v. Little Rock,   361 U. S. 516 .  But these cases purported only to discuss what issues a litigant might raise, not when he might raise them.  That a proper party is before the court is no answer to the objection that he is there prematurely.  In none of the cases cited was the constitutional issue decided on a record which showed only potential deterrence of association with the litigant on the part of an unnamed and uncounted number of persons.    In the  Refugee Committee  case, three organizations sued for injunctive or declaratory relief, challenging their inclusion on the Attorney General's list as Communist organizations.  Each alleged that it had already suffered injury as a result of the listing:  that contributors had withdrawn support, that persons had refused to take part in fund-raising activities, that members had resigned.  The case came here on the pleadings, and we held such allegations sufficient as against a motion to dismiss.  In  Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra,  private schools were permitted to attack a state compulsory public education statute:  their complaints had alleged that, because of the law, students who otherwise would have continued in attendance at the schools had withdrawn. [ Footnote 28 ]  In  Buchanan v. Warley, supra,  a contract had been made, performance refused, and the state courts had denied enforcement on the ground of the challenged ordinance, and in  Truax v. Raich, supra,  in which an alien employee sued to enjoin enforcement of a statute requiring certain classes of employers to retain not less than eighty percent native-born citizens or qualified electors, Raich's employer had been arrested for violation of the statute and Raich had been threatened with immediate discharge.  In  Terrace v. Thompson,   263 U. S. 197 , both landowners and a prospective tenant brought suit to enjoin enforcement of a state statute forbidding aliens to hold land and providing that land transferred to aliens should be forfeit to the State.  The complainants alleged that they were prepared to enter into a lease, and would have done so but for the statute.  The present proceeding differs from all of these.  The record here does not show that any present members, affiliates, or contributors of the Party have withdrawn because of the threatened consequences to them of its   registration under the Subversive Activities Control Act, or that any prospective members, affiliates, or contributors have been deterred from joining the Party or giving it their support.  We cannot know how many, if any, members or prospective members of the Party are also employees or prospective employees of the Government or of defense facilities or labor unions, or how many, if any, contributors to the Party hold government or defense facility employment.  It is thus impossible to say now what effect the provisions of the Act affecting members of a registered organization will have on the Party.   Cf. New Jersey v. Sargent,   269 U. S. 328 .  To pass upon the validity of those provisions would be to make abstract assertions of possible future injury, indefinite in nature and degree, the occasion for constitutional decision.  If we did so, we would be straying beyond our judicial bounds.  Of course, the Party may now assert those rights of its members, such as that of anonymity, which are allegedly infringed by the very act of its filing a registration statement, and which could not be otherwise asserted than by raising them here.   NAACP v. Alabama, supra; Bates v. Little Rock, supra.   But the rights of its members, as potentially affected by the Act to receive and use passports, seek and hold certain employment, be naturalized and preserve their citizenship once naturalized, are not of this category.  We limit our consideration to the constitutionality of § 7 as applied in this proceeding. V The constitutional contentions raised by the Party with respect to the registration requirement of § 7 are (A) that that requirement, in the context of the Act, in effect ""outlaws"" the Party and is in the nature of a bill of attainder; (B) that compelling organizations to register and to list their members on a showing merely that they are   foreign-dominated and operate primarily to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement constitutes a restraint on freedom of expression and association in violation of the First Amendment; (C) that requiring Party officers to file registration statements for the Party subjects them to self-incrimination forbidden by the Fifth Amendment; (D) that the Act violates due process by legislative predetermination of facts essential to bring the Communist Party within the definition of a Communist action organization, and that the evidentiary elements prescribed for consideration by the Board bear no rational relation to that definition; (E) that, in several aspects the Act is unconstitutionally vague, and (F) that the Subversive Activities Control Board is so necessarily biased against the Communist Party as to deprive it of a fair hearing. A.  ""Otlawry"" and Attainder.   Our determination that, in the present proceeding, all questions are premature which regard only the constitutionality of the various particular consequences of a registration order to a registered organization and its members does not foreclose the Party from arguing -- and it does argue -- that, in light of the cumulative effect of those consequences, the registration provisions of § 7 are not what they seem, but represent a legislative attempt, by devious means, to ""outlaw"" the Party.  The registration requirement, the Party contends, was designed not with the purpose of having Communist action organizations register, but with a purpose to make it impossible to register, because of the onerous consequences of registration, and thus to establish a pretext for criminal prosecution of the organization and its members.  The Act is said to be aimed particularly at the Communist Party as an identifiable entity, intending to punish it, and, in this aspect, to constitute a bill of attainder prohibited by Art. I, § 9, cl. 3 of the Constitution.  Of course, ""only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute on such a ground.""   Flemming v. Nestor,   363 U. S. 603 ,   363 U. S. 617 .  No such proof is offered here.  The Act, on its face, gives no indication that the registration provisions were not intended to be complied with.  None of the consequences which attach to registration, whatever may be their validity when weighed separately in the constitutional balance, is so devoid of rational relation to the purposes of the Act as expressed in its second section that it appears a mere pressuring device meant to catch an organization between two fires.  Section 2 recites that the world Communist movement, whose purpose is to employ deceit, secrecy, infiltration, and sabotage as means to establish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship, establishes and utilizes action organizations.  The Act requires such organizations to register and to label their communications, and prohibits their members from government, defense facility and certain labor organization employment.  Section 2 sets forth that Communist action organizations are sections of a worldwide Communist movement and that international travel of its members and agents facilitates the purposes of the movement.  The Act restricts the ingress and access to United States citizenship of alien members of Communist action organizations, and deprives all members of the use of United States passports.  Section 2 finds that Communist action organizations purpose to overthrow the Government of the United States by any available, necessary means.  The Act forbids government and defense facility employees to support such organizations, and withdraws from the organizations and their contributors certain tax exemptions.  None of this is so lacking in consonance as to suggest a clandestine purpose behind the registration provisions.  Nor does the legislative history contain any such suggestion.  Rather, the Committee reports on the bills from which the Act   derived express an object ""to require the Communist movement in the United States to operate in the open, rather than underground,"" and ""to expose the Communist movement and protect the public against innocent and unwitting collaboration with it."" [ Footnote 29 ] It is true, as the Party asserts, that bills had been introduced in Congress that would have applied to the Communist Party by name, [ Footnote 30 ] and it is no doubt also true that the form which the Subversive Activities Control Act finally took was dictated in part by constitutional scruples against outlawing of the Party by ""legislative fiat."" [ Footnote 31 ]  It is probable, too, that the legislators who voted for the Act in its final form expected that the Communist Party, if it continued to engage in the activities which had been reported to Congress as characterizing its past conduct, would be required to register under § 7. [ Footnote 32 ]  From this, the Party would have us conclude that the Act is only an instrument serving to abolish the Communist Party by indirection.  But such an analysis ignores our duty of respect for the exercise of the legislative power of Congress, and, more specifically, ignores the crucial constitutional significance of what Congress did when it rejected   the approach of outlawing the Party by name and accepted instead a statutory program regulating not enumerated organizations but designated activities.  We would be indulging in a revisory power over enactments as they come from Congress -- a power which the Framers of the Constitution withheld from this Court -- if we so interpreted what Congress refused to do and what, in fact, Congress did; that is, if we treated this Act as merely a ruse by Congress to evade constitutional safeguards.  Congress deemed it an attempt to achieve its legislative purpose consistently with constitutional safeguards. [ Footnote 33 ]    Whether it has done so -- the issue which is now before us -- is to be determined by the manner in which the enactment works in its practical application. ""So long as Congress acts in pursuance of its constitutional power, the Judiciary lacks authority to intervene on the basis of the motives which spurred the exercise of that power."" Barenblatt v. United States,   360 U. S. 109 ,   360 U. S. 132 .   Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Atkinson Co.,   313 U. S. 508 ;  Sonzinsky v. United States,   300 U. S. 506 ;  McCray v. United States,   195 U. S. 27 .  The true and sole question before us is whether the effects of the statute as it was passed and as it operates are constitutionally permissible. The Act is not a bill of attainder.  It attaches not to specified organizations, but to described activities in which an organization may or may not engage.  The singling out of an individual for legislatively prescribed punishment constitutes an attainder whether the individual is called by name or described in terms of conduct which, because it is past conduct, operates only as a designation of particular persons.   See  Cummings v. Missouri ,  4 Wall. 277;  Ex parte Garland ,  4 Wall. 333.  The Subversive Activities Control Act is not of that kind.  It requires the registration only of organizations which, after the date of the Act, are found to be under the direction, domination, or control of certain foreign powers and to operate primarily to advance certain objectives.  This finding   must be made after full administrative hearing, subject to judicial review which opens the record for the reviewing court's determination whether the administrative findings as to fact are supported by the preponderance of the evidence.  Present activity constitutes an operative element to which the statute attaches legal consequences, not merely a point of reference for the ascertainment of particular persons ineluctably designated by the legislature. The fact that activity engaged in prior to the enactment of the legislation may be regarded administratively and judicially as relevant to a determination that an organization is presently foreign controlled and presently works to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement does not alter the operative structure of the Act.  The incidents which it reaches are nonetheless present incidents.  The past is pertinent only as probative of these.  In this proceeding, the Board has found, and the Court of Appeals has sustained its conclusion, that the Communist Party, by virtue of the activities in which it now engages, comes within the terms of the Act.  If the Party should at any time choose to abandon these activities, after it is once registered pursuant to § 7, the Act provides adequate means of relief.  As often as once a year, it may apply to the Attorney General for cancellation of registration, and, in the event of his refusal to remove it from the register and to relieve it from the duty of filing annual statements, it may petition the Board for a redetermination of its amenability to the registration requirements of the Act, pursuant to a hearing which, again, is subject to judicial review.  §§ 13(b), (i), (j), 14(a).  Far from attaching to the past and ineradicable actions of an organization, the application of the registration section is made to turn upon continuingly contemporaneous fact; its obligations arise only because, and endure only so long as, an organization presently conducts operations of a described character.  Nor is the statute made an act of ""outlawry"" or of attainder by the fact that the conduct which it regulates is described with such particularity that, in probability, few organizations will come within the statutory terms.  Legislatures may act to curb behavior which they regard as harmful to the public welfare, whether that conduct is found to be engaged in by many persons or by one.  So long as the incidence of legislation is such that the persons who engage in the regulated conduct, be they many or few, can escape regulation merely by altering the course of their own present activities, there can be no complaint of an attainder.  It would be ingenuous to refuse to recognize that the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 was designed to reach the Communist Party's operations as then reported to Congress -- operations in which, the Board has found, the Party persists.  But to base a determination of constitutionality on this design would be to confuse the occasion of legislation with its operative effect, and consequently to mistake decisive constitutional determinants.  No doubt, the activity whose regulation the Act seeks to achieve is activity historically associated with the Communist Party.  From its legislative study of the Communist Party, Congress concluded that that kind of activity was potentially dangerous to the national interest, and that it must be subjected to control.  But whatever the source from which the legislative experience and instruction derived, the Act applies to a class of activity only, not to the Communist Party as such.  Nothing in this offends the constitutional prohibition of attainder. B.  The Freedoms of Expression and Association Protected by the First Amendment.   The Communist Party would have us hold that the First Amendment prohibits Congress from requiring the registration and filing of information, including membership lists, by organizations substantially dominated or controlled by the foreign powers controlling the world Communist movement and   which operate primarily to advance the objectives of that movement:  the overthrow of existing government by any means necessary and the establishment in its place of a Communist totalitarian dictatorship (§§ 3(3), 2(1) and (6)).  We cannot find such a prohibition in the First Amendment.  So to find would make a travesty of that Amendment and the great ends for the wellbeing of our democracy that it serves. No doubt, a governmental regulation which requires registration as a condition upon the exercise of speech may in some circumstances affront the constitutional guarantee of free expression. [ Footnote 34 ]   Thomas v. Collins,   323 U. S. 516 .  In that case, the Court held that a State could not constitutionally punish for contempt a public speaker who had addressed a labor organization meeting in violation of a restraining order prohibiting him from soliciting memberships in a labor union without having first registered as a paid labor organizer and secured an organizer's card.  The decision was a narrow one, striking down the registration requirement only as applied to the particular circumstances of the case,  id.  at   323 U. S. 541 -542 -- that is, to an individual who, as the Court several times insisted, had come into the State ""for one purpose and one only -- to make the speech in question.""   Id.  at   323 U. S. 533 ; see   also  id.  at   323 U. S. 521 ,   323 U. S. 526 . [ Footnote 35 ]  Since this speech was the sole incident of Thomas' conduct upon which the State relied in asserting that he was an ""organizer"" and thus required to register as such, the Court regarded the statute, in this application, as basing the obligation to register upon speech activity alone. [ Footnote 36 ]  ""So long as no more is involved than exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly,"" the Court said, ""it is immune to such a restriction.""   Id.  at   323 U. S. 540 .  The present statute does not, of course, attach the registration requirement to the incident of speech, but to the incidents of foreign domination and of operation to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement -- operation which, the Board has found here, includes extensive, long-continuing organizational, as well as ""speech,"" activity.  Thus, the  Thomas  case is applicable here only insofar as it establishes that subjection to registration requirements may be a sufficient restraint upon the exercise of liberties protected by the First Amendment to merit that it be weighed in the constitutional balance. Similarly, we agree that compulsory disclosure of the names of an organization's members may in certain instances infringe constitutionally protected rights of association.   NAACP v. Alabama,   357 U. S. 449 ;  Bates v. Little Rock,   361 U. S. 516 ;  Shelton v. Tucker,   364 U. S. 479 .  But to say this much is only to recognize   one of the points of reference from which analysis must begin.  To state that individual liberties may be affected is to establish the condition for, not to arrive at the conclusion of, constitutional decision.  Against the impediments which particular governmental regulation causes to entire freedom of individual action, there must be weighed the value to the public of the ends which the regulation may achieve.   Schenck v. United States,   249 U. S. 47 ;  Dennis v. United States,   341 U. S. 494 ;  American Communications Assn. v. Douds,   339 U. S. 382 . In the  NAACP  and  Bates  cases, this Court examined the circumstances under which disclosure was demanded, and concluded that ""whatever interest the State may have in obtaining names of ordinary members has not been shown to be sufficient to overcome [the] . . . constitutional objections to the production order."" NAACP v. Alabama,  357 U.S. at   357 U. S. 465 .  In the  NAACP  case, the Attorney General of Alabama had brought an equity suit to enjoin the Association from conducting further activities within, and to oust it from, the State on the grounds of its noncompliance with Alabama's foreign corporation registration statute.  The Attorney General sought, and the state court ordered, production of lists of the Association's rank-and-file members as pertinent to the issues whether the NAACP was conducting intrastate business in violation of the statute, and whether the extent of that business justified its permanent ouster from the State.  Noting that the Association had admitted its presence and conduct of activities in Alabama during almost forty years and that it had offered to comply in all respects with the qualification statute, we said that ""we are unable to perceive that the disclosure of the names of [NAACP's] . . . rank-and-file members has a substantial bearing"" upon any issue presented to the Alabama courts.   Id.  at   357 U. S. 464 .   Bates v. Little Rock, supra,  involved the conviction of   custodians of records of branches of the NAACP for failure to comply with provisions of local regulations which required organizations operating within the municipality to file with a municipal official,  inter alia,  financial statements showing the names of all contributors to the organizations.  These regulations were amendments to ordinances levying license taxes on persons engaging in businesses, occupations or professions within municipal limits. Finding that the occupation taxes were based on the nature of the activity or enterprise conducted, not upon earnings or income, and, moreover, that there had been no showing that the NAACP branches were engaged in activity taxable under the ordinances, or had ever been regarded by tax authorities as subject to taxation under the ordinances, the Court concluded that: ""In this record, we can find no relevant correlation between the power of the municipalities to impose occupational license taxes and the compulsory disclosure and publication of the membership lists of the local branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People."" 361 U.S. at   361 U. S. 525 .  Thus, these cases hold that, where the required making public of an organization's membership lists bears no rational relation to the interest which is asserted by the State to justify disclosure, and where because of community temper publication might prejudice members whose names were revealed, disclosure cannot constitutionally be compelled. Shelton v. Tucker, supra,  did not involve legislation which, as a means of regulating an appropriately defined class of organizations whose activities menaced the public welfare, required those organizations to reveal their members.  It involved an Arkansas statute which, conversely, as an incident of the State's attempt to control the activities of a class of individuals -- the teachers in its public schools and publicly supported institutions of higher learning -- required the individuals to disclose the associations   to which they belonged.  The statute's purported justification lay in its furtherance of the State's effective selection of teaching personnel; to subserve this end, it attempted to ""ask every one of its teachers to disclose every single organization with which he has been associated over a five-year period.""  364 U.S. at   364 U. S. 487 -488.  The Court, finding that ""Many such relationships could have no possible bearing upon the teacher's occupational competence or fitness,""  id.  at   364 U. S. 488 , and hence that ""The statute's comprehensive interference with associational freedom goes far beyond what might be justified in the exercise of the State's legitimate inquiry into the fitness and competency of its teachers,"" id.  at   364 U. S. 490 , struck the legislation down.  Again, the  ratio decidendi  of the decision was the absence of substantial connection between the breadth of disclosure demanded and the purpose which disclosure was asserted to serve. The present case differs from  Thomas v. Collins  and from  NAACP, Bates,  and  Shelton  in the magnitude of the public interests which the registration and disclosure provisions are designed to protect and in the pertinence which registration and disclosure bear to the protection of those interests.  Congress itself has expressed in § 2 of the Act both what those interests are and what, in its view, threatens them.  On the basis of its detailed investigations, Congress has found that there exists a world Communist movement, foreign controlled, whose purpose it is by whatever means necessary to establish Communist totalitarian dictatorship in the countries throughout the world, and which has already succeeded in supplanting governments in other countries.  Congress has found that, in furthering these purposes, the foreign government controlling the world Communist movement establishes in various countries action organizations which, dominated from abroad, endeavor to bring about the overthrow of existing governments, by force if need be, and to establish   totalitarian dictatorships subservient to that foreign government.  And Congress has found that these action organizations employ methods of infiltration and secretive and coercive tactics; that, by operating in concealment and through Communist front organizations, they are able to obtain the support of persons who would not extend such support knowing of their true nature; that a Communist network exists in the United States, and that the agents of communism have devised methods of sabotage and espionage carried out in successful evasion of existing law.  The purpose of the Subversive Activities Control Act is said to be to prevent the worldwide Communist conspiracy from accomplishing its purpose in this country. It is not for the courts to reexamine the validity of these legislative findings and reject them.   See Harisiades v. Shaughnessy,   342 U. S. 580 ,   342 U. S. 590 .  They are the product of extensive investigation by Committees of Congress over more than a decade and a half. [ Footnote 37 ]   Cf.   291 U. S.    New     York,   291 U. S. 502 ,   291 U. S. 516 ,   291 U. S. 530 .  We certainly cannot dismiss them as unfounded or irrational imaginings.   See Galvan v. Press,   347 U. S. 522 ,   347 U. S. 529 ;  American Communications Assn. v. Douds,   339 U. S. 382 ,   339 U. S. 388 -389.  And if we accept them, as we must, as a not unentertainable appraisal by Congress of the threat which Communist organizations pose not only to existing government in the United States, but to the United States as a sovereign, independent nation -- if we accept as not wholly unsupportable the conclusion that those organizations ""are not free and independent organizations, but are sections of a worldwide Communist organization and are controlled, directed, and subject to the discipline of the Communist dictatorship of [a] . . . foreign country,"" § 2(5) -- we must recognize that the power of Congress to regulate Communist organizations of this nature is extensive.  ""Security against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society,"" James Madison wrote in The Federalist (No. 41).  ""It is an avowed and essential object of the American Union.  The powers requisite for attaining it must be effectually confided to the federal councils.""  The Federalist (Wright ed.1961) 295.   See also  The Federalist (Nos. 2-5),  id.  at 93  et seq.   Means for effective resistance against foreign incursion -- whether, in the form of organizations which function, in some technical sense,   as ""agents"" of a foreign power, [ Footnote 38 ] or in the form of organizations which, by complete dedication and obedience to foreign directives, make themselves the instruments of a foreign power -- may not be denied to the national legislature. ""To preserve its independence, and give security against foreign aggression and encroachment, is the highest duty of every nation, and to attain these ends nearly all other considerations are to be subordinated.  It matters not in what form such aggression and encroachment come. . . ."" The Chinese Exclusion Case,   130 U. S. 581 ,   130 U. S. 606 .   See also Perez v. Brownell,   356 U. S. 44 ;  Ex parte Quirin,  317 U.S. l;  Hines v. Davidowitz,   312 U. S. 52 ;  United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,   299 U. S. 304 ,   299 U. S. 315 -322;  Mackenzie v. Hare,   239 U. S. 299 ,   239 U. S. 311 ;  Fong Yue Ting v. United States,   149 U. S. 698 ; Mr. Justice Bradley, concurring in the  Legal Tender Cases ,  12 Wall. 457,   79 U. S. 554 ,   79 U. S. 556 . Of course, congressional power in this sphere, as in all spheres, is limited by the First Amendment.  Individual liberties fundamental to American institutions are not to be destroyed under pretext of preserving those institutions, even from the gravest external dangers.  But where the problems of accommodating the exigencies of self-preservation and the values of liberty are as complex and intricate as they are in the situation described in the findings of § 2 of the Subversive Activities Control Act -- when existing government is menaced by a worldwide integrated movement which employs every combination of possible means, peaceful and violent, domestic and foreign, overt and clandestine, to destroy the government itself -- the legislative judgment as to how that threat may best be met consistently with the safeguarding of personal freedom is not to be set aside merely because the   judgment of judges would, in the first instance, have chosen other methods.  Especially where Congress, in seeking to reconcile competing and urgently demanding values within our social institutions, legislates not to prohibit individuals from organizing for the effectuation of ends found to be menacing to the very existence of those institutions, but only to prescribe the conditions under which such organization is permitted, the legislative determination must be respected.   United Public Workers v. Mitchell,   330 U. S. 75 ;  American Communications Assn. v. Douds, supra. In a number of situations in which secrecy or the concealment of associations has been regarded as a threat to public safety and to the effective, free functioning of our national institutions Congress has met the threat by requiring registration or disclosure. [ Footnote 39 ]  The Federal Corrupt Practices Act, enacted in 1925, 43 Stat. 1070, 2 U.S.C. §§ 241-245, requires all political committees (organizations accepting contributions or making expenditures   to influence the election of candidates for designated national offices in two or more States, or branches of national committees) to have a chairman and a treasurer, and makes it the duty of the treasurer to keep detailed financial accounts and to file with the Clerk of the House of Representatives periodic statements containing,  inter alia,  the names and addresses of all persons contributing more than $100 to the committee during any year.   Burroughs v. United States,   290 U. S. 534 , sustained that statute against the claim that Congress lacked constitutional power to regulate such political organizations; the Court found ample authority in congressional power ""to preserve the departments and institutions of the general government from impairment or destruction, whether threatened by force or by corruption."" Id.  at   290 U. S. 545 .  The Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, 60 Stat. 839, 2 U.S.C. §§ 261-270, applies to any person who solicits or receives money or anything of value to be used principally, or if the person's principal purpose is, to influence the passage or defeat of legislation by Congress.  It requires any person receiving any contributions or expending any money for the purposes of influencing the passage or defeat of legislation to file with the Clerk of the House quarterly statements which set out the name and address of each person who has made a contribution of $500 or more not mentioned in the preceding report.  It also requires that any person who engages himself for pay for the purpose of attempting to influence the passage or defeat of legislation, before doing anything in furtherance of that objective, register with the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate, and state in writing,  inter alia,  his name and address and the name and address of the person by whom he is employed, and in whose interest he works.  These paid lobbyists must file quarterly reports of all money received and expended in carrying on their work, to whom paid, for what purposes,   the names of publications in which they have caused any articles to be published, and the proposed legislation they are employed to support or oppose; this information is to be printed in the Congressional Record.  In  United States v. Harriss,   347 U. S. 612 , we held that the First Amendment did not prohibit the prosecution of criminal informations charging violation of the registration and reporting provisions of the Act.  We said: ""Present-day legislative complexities are such that individual members of Congress cannot be expected to explore the myriad pressures to which they are regularly subjected.  Yet full realization of the American ideal of government by elected representatives depends to no small extent on their ability to properly evaluate such pressures.  Otherwise, the voice of the people may all too easily be drowned out by the voice of special interest groups seeking favored treatment while masquerading as proponents of the public weal.  This is the evil which the Lobbying Act was designed to help prevent."" ""Toward that end, Congress has not sought to prohibit these pressures.  It has merely provided for a modicum of information from those who, for hire, attempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend funds for that purpose.  It wants only to know who is being hired, who is putting up the money, and how much. . . ."" Id.  at   347 U. S. 625 .  The Foreign Agents Registration Act, first enacted in 1938, 52 Stat. 631, and since several times amended, provides, as now set forth in 22 U.S.C. §§ 611-621, that agents of foreign principals must register with the Attorney General and file periodic registration statements (which are to be held by the Attorney General open to public inspection) containing, among other information, the registrant's name, a comprehensive statement of the   nature of the registrant's business, a complete list of the registrant's employees and a statement of the nature of the work of each (unless this requirement is waived by the Attorney General), the name and address of the registrant's foreign principals, with further information as to the principals' character, ownership and control, the names and addresses of all persons other than a registrant's foreign principal who contribute to the registrant in connection with specified activities of the registrant, and detailed financial accounts.  Such agents must also file with the Attorney General and the Librarian of Congress, and must label as emanating from a registered agent of a foreign principal, and mark with the name of the agent and the principal, any political propaganda transmitted in the United States mails or through any instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce.  In addition, Title 18 U.S.C. § 2386, derived from the so-called Voorhis Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1201, requires the registration with the Attorney General of organizations subject to foreign control which engage in political or civilian military activity (as those terms are defined in the section), organizations which engage in both political and civilian military activity (as defined), and organizations whose purpose is the overthrow of government by the use or threat of force or violence or military measures.  Organizations required to register must report,  inter alia,  the names and addresses of their officers, branch officers and contributors, a detailed description of their activities, and a detailed statement of assets, and must file copies of publications which they issue or distribute; registration statements must be kept up to date and are to be open for public examination.  Committee reports pertinent to the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 state that the necessity for the legislation derived in part from the difficulty of enforcing the Foreign Agents Registration and Voorhis Acts against Communist organizations ""due in part to   the skill and deceit which the Communists have used in concealing their foreign ties."" [ Footnote 40 ] Certainly, as the  Burroughs  and  Harris  cases abundantly recognize, secrecy of associations and organizations, even among groups concerned exclusively with political processes, may under some circumstances constitute a danger which legislatures do not lack constitutional power to curb.  In  New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman,   278 U. S. 63 , this Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was not offended by a state statute requiring filing with the Secretary of State of the constitution and by laws, rules and regulations, membership oath, roster of members and list of officers of every association of twenty or more members having as a condition of membership an oath.  The statute made it unlawful to become or remain a member of such an association with knowledge that it had failed to comply with the filing requirement.  Exceptions for labor unions and benevolent orders indicated that the measure was directed primarily at the Ku Klux Klan.  Compelling disclosure of membership lists and other information by organizations of the character of the Klan, the Court found, was reasonable both as a means for providing the government of the State with knowledge of the activities of those organizations within its borders and because ""requiring this information to be supplied for the public files will operate as an effective or substantial deterrent from the violations of public and private right to which the association might be tempted if such a disclosure were not required."" Id.  at 72.  It was the nature of the organization regulated, and hence the danger involved in its covert operation, which justified the statute and caused us to distinguish the  Bryant  case in  NAACP v. Alabama,     supra,  357 U.S. at   357 U. S. 465 . [ Footnote 41 ]  In  NAACP  and  Bates v. Little Rock, supra,  as we have said, there was no showing of any danger inherent in concealment, no showing that the State, in seeking disclosure, was attempting to cope with any perceived danger.  Nor was this kind of danger -- arising when secrecy itself is made an active instrument of public harm -- put forth to justify the statute which was held invalid in  Shelton v. Tucker, supra. Congress, when it enacted the Subversive Activities Control Act, did attempt to cope with precisely such a danger.  In light of its legislative findings, based on voluminous evidence collected during years of investigation, we cannot say that that danger is chimerical, or that the registration requirement of § 7 is an ill-adjusted means of dealing with it.  In saying this, we are not insensitive to the fact that the public opprobrium and obloquy which may attach to an individual listed with the Attorney General as a member of a Communist action organization is no less considerable than that with which members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People were threatened in  NAACP  and  Bates.   But while an angry public opinion, and the evils which it may spawn, are relevant considerations in adjudging, in light of the totality of relevant considerations, the validity of legislation that, in effecting disclosure, may thereby entail some restraints on speech and association, the existence of an ugly public temper does not, as such and without more, incapacitate government to require publicity demanded by rational interests high in the scale of national concern.  Where the mask of anonymity which an organization's members wear serves the double purpose   of protecting them from popular prejudice and of enabling them to cover over a foreign-directed conspiracy infiltrate into other groups, and enlist the support of persons who would not, if the truth were revealed, lend their support,  see  § 2(1), (6), (7), it would be a distortion of the First Amendment to hold that it prohibits Congress from removing the mask. These considerations lead us to sustain the registration provisions of § 7 as not repugnant to the First Amendment insofar as they require Communist action organizations to file a registration statement containing the names and addresses of its present officers and members.  The requirement that persons who were officers or members at any time during the year preceding registration must be listed,  see  § 7(d)(2), (4), is a reasonable means of assuring that the obligation to list present members and officers will not be evaded.  For reasons which do not require elaboration, the requirement that a registering organization list the aliases of officers and members,  see  § 7(d)(5), must also be sustained.  Nor do we find that § 7(d)(3), requiring a financial accounting, or § 7(d)(6), [ Footnote 42 ] requiring a listing of all printing presses in the possession or control of the organization or its members violates First Amendment rights.  Disclosure both of the financial transactions of a Communist action organization and of the identity of the organs of publication which it controls might not unreasonably have been regarded by Congress as necessary to the objective which the Act seeks to achieve:  to bring foreign-dominated organizations out into the open, where the public can evaluate their activities informedly against the revealed background of their character, nature, and connections.  Of course, printing presses may not be regulated like guns.  That generalization gets us nowhere.  On the concrete, specific issue before us, we hold that the   obligation to give information identifying presses, without more and as applied to foreign-dominated organizations, does not fetter constitutionally protected free expression.  No other kind of regulation is involved here.  As to the penalties for failure to register,  see  § 15(a), which the Party attacks as exorbitant and oppressive, these are not now before us.  They have not yet been imposed on the Party, and may never be.   United States v. Harriss,   347 U. S. 612 ;  United States v. Wurzbach,   280 U. S. 396 . It is argued that, if Congress may constitutionally enact legislation requiring the Communist Party to register, to list its members, to file financial statements, and to identify its printing presses, Congress may impose similar requirements upon any group which pursues unpopular political objectives or which expresses an unpopular political ideology.  Nothing which we decide here remotely carries such an implication.  The Subversive Activities Control Act applies only to foreign-dominated organizations which work primarily to advance the objectives of a world movement controlled by the government of a foreign country.   See  §§ 3(3), 2(4).  It applies only to organizations directed, dominated, or controlled by a particular foreign country, the leader of a movement which, Congress has found, is, ""in its origins, its development, and its present practice, . . . a worldwide revolutionary movement whose purpose it is, by treachery, deceit, infiltration into other groups . . . espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to establish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship in the countries throughout the world through the medium of a worldwide Communist organization."" § 2(1).  This is the full purported reach of the statute, [ Footnote 43 ] and its fullest effect.  There is no   attempt here to impose stifling obligations upon the proponents of a particular political creed as such, or even to check the importation of particular political ideas from abroad for propagation here.  The Act compels the registration of organized groups which have been made the instruments of a long-continued, systematic, disciplined activity directed by a foreign power and purposing to overthrow existing government in this country.  Organizations are subject to it only when shown, after administrative hearing subject to judicial review, to be dominated by the foreign power or its organs and to operate primarily to advance its purposes.  That a portion of the evidence upon which such a showing is made may consist in the expression of political views by the organization does not alter the character of the Act or of the incidents to which it attaches.  Such expressions are relevant only as probative of foreign control and of the purposes to which the organization's actions are directed.  The Board, in the present proceeding, so understood the Act.  The registration requirement of § 7, on its face and as here applied, does not violate the First Amendment. C.  Self-Incrimination, of the Party's Officers.   Section 7(a) and (c) requires that organizations determined to be Communist action organizations by the Subversive Activities Control Board register within thirty days after the Board's registration order becomes final.  Registration is to be accompanied by a registration statement, prepared in such manner and form as the Attorney General, by regulations, prescribes. § 7(d).  The form which, pursuant to this authority, the Attorney General has prescribed requires that registration statements ""shall be signed by the partners, officers, and directors, including the members of the governing body of the organization.""  28 CFR § 1 1.200; Dept. Justice Form ISA-1.  If the organization fails to register or to file a registration statement, it is the duty of the executive officer, the secretary,   the president or chairman, the vice-president or vice-chairman, the treasurer, and the members of the governing board, council, or body, to register the organization by filing a registration statement for it within ten days after the expiration of the thirty-day registration period allowed the organization.   See  28 CFR § 11.205, issued pursuant to § 7(h) of the Act.  The Party contends that these requirements cannot be imposed and exacted consistently with the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Officers of the Party, it is argued, are compelled, in the very act of filing a signed registration statement, to admit that they are Party officers -- an admission which we have held incriminating.   Blau v. United States,   340 U. S. 159 ;  cf. Quinn v. United States,   349 U. S. 155 .  What is required is said to be not merely the production of documents kept in an official capacity for the Party,  see McPhaul v. United States,   364 U. S. 372 ;  United States v. White,   322 U. S. 694 ;  Wilson v. United States,   221 U. S. 361 , but individual action by the officers which, by establishing a connection between the officers and the documents, in effect convicts the officers out of their own mouths.   Cf. Curcio v. United States,   354 U. S. 118 . Manifestly, insofar as this contention is directed against the provisions of § 7(h) and 28 CFR § 11.205, requiring that designated officers file registration statements in default of registration by an organization, it is prematurely raised in the present proceeding.  The duties imposed by those provisions will not arise until and unless the Party fails to register.  At this time, their application is wholly contingent and conjectural.   Cf. Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory,   325 U. S. 450 . [ Footnote 44 ] We find that the self-incrimination challenge to § 7(a) and (d), as implemented by the Attorney General's regulations   and forms, is also premature at this time.  The privilege against self-incrimination is one which normally must be claimed by the individual who seeks to avail himself of its protection.   Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration,   273 U. S. 103 ;  United States v. Murdock,   284 U. S. 141 ;  Rogers v. United States,   340 U. S. 367 ;  see also Smith v. United States,   337 U. S. 137 ,   337 U. S. 147 -148;  United States v. Monia,   317 U. S. 424 ,   317 U. S. 427 .  We cannot know now that the Party's officers will ever claim the privilege.  There is no indication that, in the past, its high-ranking officials have sought to conceal their identity, and no reason to believe that, in the future, they will decline to file a registration statement whose whole effect, in this regard, is further to evidence a fact which, traditionally, has been one of public notice.  Within thirty days after the Board's registration order becomes final, the Party's officers may file signed registration statements in the form required by Form ISA-1.  Or they may file statements claiming the privilege in lieu of furnishing the required information.  If a claim of privilege is made, it may or may not be honored by the Attorney General.  We cannot, on the basis of supposition that privilege will be claimed and not honored, proceed now to adjudicate the constitutionality under the Fifth Amendment of the registration provisions.  Whatever proceeding may be taken after and if the privilege is claimed will provide an adequate forum for litigation of that issue. The Party contends, however, that, under the Subversive Activities Control Act, there will be no opportunity for its officers to claim the Fifth Amendment privilege without, at the same time, giving up all the protection which the Fifth Amendment secures them.  Persons who come forward to make the claim, it is said, will as much reveal themselves to the Attorney General as officers of the Party as if they had, in fact, filed a registration statement.  But it is always true that one who is required to   assert the privilege against self-incrimination may thereby arouse the suspicions of prosecuting authorities.  Nevertheless, it is not and has never been the law that the privilege disallows the asking of potentially incriminatory questions or authorizes the person of whom they are asked to evade them without expressly asserting that his answers may tend to incriminate him.   State v. Kemp,  126 Conn. 60, 9 A.2d 63;  O'Connell v. United States,  40 F.2d 201 (C.A.2d Cir.);  In re Knickerbocker Steamboat Co.,  139 F. 713 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.);  In re Groban,  99 Ohio App. 512, 135 N.E.2d 477,  aff'd,  164 Ohio St. 26, 128 N.E.2d 106,  aff'd,   352 U. S. 330 ;  Allhusen v. Labouchere,  L.R. 3 Q.B. D. 654;  Fisher v. Owen,  L.R. 8 Ch.D. 645.   And see United States v. Hiss,  185 F.2d 822 (C.A.2d Cir.);  Commonwealth v. Granito,  326 Mass. 494,  95 N.E.2d 539 .  In  United States v. Sullivan,   274 U. S. 259 , this Court sustained a conviction for failure to file an income tax return, despite the defendant's objection that answers called for on the return would have incriminated him.  Mr. Justice Holmes, for a unanimous Court, wrote that ""If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was privileged from making he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. . . .  [I]f the defendant desired to test that or any other point he should have tested it in the return so that it could be passed upon.  He could not draw a conjurer's circle around the whole matter by his own declaration that to write any word upon the government blank would bring him into danger of the law."" Id.  at   274 U. S. 263 -264.  This would, of course, be the normal rule.  Perhaps  Sullivan  is distinguishable, however, from the situation of registration under the Subversive Activities Control Act.  Tax returns must be filed generally, and answers to tax return questions may involve any of a wide variety of activities, whereas the obligation to file a registration   statement compels a few particular individuals to come forward, to identify themselves, and to suggest, at least, their connection with a relatively limited potential sphere of criminal conduct.  Then, too, in  Sullivan,  Mr. Justice Holmes assumed that some, at least, of the answers to the questions on the tax return would not have been incriminating, whereas, in the case of the registration statement, any claim of the privilege would involve the withholding of all information; thus, there is, presumably, a greater governmental interest in having the privilege claimed specifically on the form in the tax return circumstances.  To suggest these possible distinctions is to recognize that the applicability of the  Sullivan  principle here may raise novel and difficult questions as to the reach of the Fifth Amendment -- questions which should not be discussed in advance of the necessity of deciding them.   See Peters v. Hobby,   349 U. S. 331 ,   349 U. S. 338 .  The stage at which that decision will become necessary, if at all, is the stage at which  Sullivan  itself was decided:  when enforcement proceedings for failure to register are instituted against the Party or against its officers.   See People v. McCormick,   102 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 954 , 228 P.2d 349. In arguing that the issue is not now premature, the Party cites  Boyd v. United States,   116 U. S. 616 , for the proposition that, where a statute compelling the production of potentially incriminating information allows the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege only under circumstances which effectively nullify the Amendment's protection, the statute may be held ""unconstitutional and void,"" not merely unenforceable in cases in which a proper claim of privilege is made.  Assuming  arguendo  that this proposition is correct, the most that can be drawn from it of pertinence to the present case is that, in a prosecution of the Party for failure to register, or in a prosecution of its officers for failure to register the Party, the Court would have to determine whether the Subversive Activities Control   Act is a statute which, like the statute in  Boyd,  unconstitutionally circumscribes the effectual exercise of the privilege.  Obviously, such a determination would never have to be made if an enforcement proceeding were never brought -- either because Party officials registered pursuant to § 7(a) and (d) without complaint or because they did choose to assert the privilege in some form in which it could be recognized.  The  Boyd  case involved a statute providing that, in proceedings other than criminal arising under the revenue laws, the Government could secure an order of the court requiring the production by an opposing claimant or defendant of any documents under his control which, the Government asserted, might tend to prove any of the Government's allegations.  If production were not made, the allegations were to be taken as confessed.  On the Government's motion, the District Court had entered such an order, requiring the claimants in a forfeiture proceeding to produce a specified invoice.  Although the claimants objected that the order was improper and the statute unconstitutional in coercing self-incriminatory disclosures and permitting unreasonable searches and seizures, they did, under protest, produce the invoice, which was, again over their constitutional objection, admitted into evidence.  This Court held that, on such a record, a judgment for the United States could not stand, and that the statute was invalid as repugnant to the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  In  Boyd,  production had been ordered, objected to, and, the Court held, unconstitutionally compelled.  There is nothing in the case which justifies advisory adjudication of self-incrimination questions prior to the time when a demand for information has been, at the least, made and resisted. D.  Legislative Predetermination of Adjudicative Fact.   It is next asserted that the Act offends the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by predetermining legislatively facts upon which the application of the registration   provisions to the Communist Party depends.  Two arguments are made in this regard.  The first is that, although § 3(3), defining a ""Communist action organization,"" purports to require findings that an organization is controlled by ""the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in section 2 . . ."" and operates primarily to advance the objectives ""of such world Communist movement as referred to in section 2 . . . ,"" the existence of a world Communist movement, its direction by the government of a foreign country, and the nature of its objectives are ""found"" by Congress in § 2, and may not be litigated in proceedings before the Board.  Thus, an organization is precluded from showing operative facts which would take it out of § 3(3):   viz.,  that there is no world Communist movement, or that, if there is, it is not controlled by a foreign government, or that it does not have the objectives attributed to it by § 2.  The second argument is that the Board was in effect foreclosed from finding that the Party was not a Communist action organization by the declarations, in § 2(9), (12), and (15), that there are in the United States individuals who knowingly and willfully participate in the world Communist movement, that there is a Communist network in the United States, and that the ""Communist movement in the United States is an organization. . . .""  Given these ""facts,"" it is asserted, nothing is left to the Board but to supply the name of the organization -- a name which, the Party contends, is obvious.  Further, it is pointed out, Congress in 1954, prior to the Board's final determination in this proceeding, enacted the Communist Control Act, 68 Stat. 775, 50 U.S.C. § 841  et seq.,  which declares in its second section: ""The Congress hereby finds and declares that the Communist Party of the United States, although purportedly a political party, is, in fact, an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government   of the United States. . . .  [T]he policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders of the world Communist movement. . . .  [I]ts role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United States. . . ."" The Board could not, therefore, the Party argues, find that the Communist Party was not a Communist action organization without contradicting Congress. First:   we have held  supra  that the congressional findings that there exists a world Communist movement, that it is directed by the Communist dictatorship of a foreign country, and that it has certain designated objectives,  inter alia,  the establishment of a Communist totalitarian dictatorship throughout the world through the medium of a worldwide Communist organization, § 2(1), (4), are not open to reexamination by the Board.  We find that nothing in this violates due process.  Under § 3(3) of the Act, an organization may not be found to be a Communist action organization unless it is shown to be, first, ""substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in section 2. . . ."" The only operative function of § 2 in this respect is to designate what Congress meant by ""world Communist movement,"" ""the foreign government,"" etc. The characteristics of the movement and the source of its control are not to be established by the Attorney General in proceedings before the Board, nor may they be disproved. But this is because they are merely defining terms whose truth, as such, is irrelevant to the issues in such proceedings. They are referents which identify ""the foreign government"" to which § 3(3) adverts. The Board, construing the statute, concluded that that foreign government was the Soviet Union. We affirm that construction.    The statute, then, defines a Communist action organization in terms of substantial direction, domination, or control by the Soviet Union.  The Government offered evidence to show that the Soviet Union substantially directed, dominated, or controlled the Communist Party.  The Party had an opportunity to rebut this showing, and it attempted to do so.  The Board found that the Government's showing was persuasive; it issued a 240-page report so concluding, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  None of the operative facts were ""predetermined,"" except in the sense in which any statute, as construed, designates the nature of the facts pertinent to issues which may be litigated under it.  If, in future years, in a future world situation, the Soviet Union is no longer the foreign country to which § 2(1) and (4), fairly read in their context, refer -- so that substantial domination by the Soviet Union would not bring an organization within the terms of § 3(3) -- that, too, will be a matter of statutory construction which no ""findings"" in the statute foreclose.  The Board or a reviewing court will be able to say that the ""world Communist movement,"" as Congress meant the term in 1950 (and whether or not there really existed, in 1950, a movement having all the characteristics described in § 2), no longer exists, or that Country X or Y, not the Soviet Union, now directs it.  A similar process of adjudication is required under § 3(3)(a)(ii), the ""objectives"" component of the definition of a Communist action organization.  It provides that, in order to be found a Communist action organization, an organization must be shown to operate ""primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement as referred to in section 2. . . .""  What those objectives are is made clear by the terms of § 2 itself.  They are there described in detail.  Whether they are, in fact, the objectives of some ""world Communist movement"" which, in fact, exists may not be litigated, because the question is irrelevant.  Whether the   particular organization against whom the Attorney General files a petition for a registration order operates primarily to advance those objectives is the pertinent issue under the statute, and this issue may be litigated.  That is all that due process requires. The decisions cited by the Party,  Tot v. United States,   319 U. S. 463 ;  McFarland v. American Sugar Ref. Co.,   241 U. S. 79 ;  Manley v. Georgia,   279 U. S. 1 ;  Western & Atlantic R. Co. v. Henderson,   279 U. S. 639 ,  and see Bailey v. Alabama,   219 U. S. 219 , have no application here.  These cases involved statutes which, purporting to attach legal consequences to one set of facts, created a rebuttable presumption of the existence of that set of facts which arose upon proof of other facts having, this Court found, no rational relation to the facts upon which the statutory consequences turned.  The Subversive Activities Control Act, however, does not define a Communist action organization as one which operates primarily to advance whatever objectives are actually held by the world Communist movement, leaving these objectives as facts to be proved.  It finds that the particular objectives set out in § 2 are those of the world Communist movement, and requires the registration of certain foreign-dominated organizations which operate primarily to advance those objectives.  One, and only one, set of facts is in issue under § 3(3)(a)(ii):  whether a particular organization does or does not operate primarily to advance those objectives; and, as to this, the legislation ""predetermines"" nothing. Second:   we do not find that the congressional assertions in § 2(9), (12) and (15), that there exist in the United States individuals dedicated to communism, a ""Communist network,"" a ""Communist movement,"" and a Communist ""organization,"" deprive the Party of the fair hearing which due process of law requires.  Fairly read, these findings neither compel nor suggest the outcome in   any particular litigation before the Board.  They do not create the impression that there is a single Communist action organization in the United States, still less that the Communist Party is ""it.""  Nor can we hold that the findings of § 2 of the Communist Control Act of 1954 unconstitutionally prejudice the Party.  It is not suggested that these were enacted with a purpose to influence the then-pending proceedings in the present case.  Rather, they are a portion of legislation deemed necessary by Congress pursuant to its continuing duty to protect the national welfare.  Nowhere in the extensive modified reports of the Board nor in the opinions of the Court of Appeals are the 1954 legislative findings considered.  While we must, of course, assume that the Board was aware of them, we cannot say that their very annunciation by Congress -- in the absence of any showing that the Board took them into account -- foreclosed or impaired a fair administrative determination. The other constitutional questions raised by the Party have been carefully considered, but do not call for detailed discussion.  And we must decline, of course, to enter into discussion of the wisdom of this legislation.  The Constitution does not prohibit the requirement that the Communist Party register with the Attorney General as a Communist action organization pursuant to § 7. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed. [ Footnote 1 ] By the Communist Control Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 775, the Subversive Activities Control Board is given jurisdiction to determine in proper proceedings, whether any organization is a Communist-infiltrated organization, defined as (A) an organization substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by an individual or individuals who are, or who within three years have been actively engaged in, giving aid or support to a Communist action organization, a Communist foreign government, or the world Communist movement, (B) which organization is serving or within three years has served as a means for giving aid or support to any such organization, government or movement, or for the impairment of the military strength of the United States or its industrial capacity to furnish logistical or other material support required by its armed forces.  Evidentiary matters relevant to this determination are prescribed for the consideration of the Board.  Communist-infiltrated organizations are not required to register with the Attorney General, but are required to label their publications mailed or transmitted through instrumentalities of interstate or foreign commerce, and their communications broadcasts, and are deprived of federal income tax exemption, of certain benefits under the National Labor Relations Act as amended, etc. Under § 13A(h), added to the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 by the Communist Control Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 775, 779, the provisions depriving labor organizations of National Labor Relations Act labor union benefits apply to labor organizations determined by the Board to be Communist action or Communist front, as well as Communist-infiltrated, organizations.  50 U.S.C. § 792a(h). [ Footnote 2 ] Under § 5(b), the Secretary of Defense is authorized and directed to designate and proclaim a list of facilities with respect to the operation of which he finds that the security of the United States requires the application of the controls prescribed by the Act. [ Footnote 3 ] The proviso respecting alien members of Communist fronts is: "". . . unless such aliens establish that they did not have knowledge or reason to believe at the time they became members of or affiliated with such an organization (and did not thereafter and prior to the date upon which such organization was so registered or so required to be registered have such knowledge or reason to believe that such organization was a Communist organization.)"" The provisions of § 212(a)(29)(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 163, 186, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(29)(c) also exclude aliens who the consular officer or the Attorney General knows or has reasonable ground to believe probably would, after entry, join, affiliate with, or participate in the activities of an organization registered or required to be registered. [ Footnote 4 ] Section 25 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 provided:  ""If a person who shall have been naturalized after January 1, 1951,"" etc. [ Footnote 5 ] During the course of proceedings before the Board, the Party had again instituted suit in the District Court to enjoin continuation of the hearings because of alleged bias of the hearing panel and because of the Senate's failure before adjournment to confirm the nomination of one member of the Board, who consequently withdrew from the panel.  This second injunction suit was dismissed on motion of the Board on February 15, 1952. [ Footnote 6 ] S.Doc. No. 41, 83d Cong., 1st Sess. [ Footnote 7 ] Section 14(a) provides: "". . .  If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Board and to be adduced upon the proceeding in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper.  The Board may modify its findings as to the facts, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings. . . ."" [ Footnote 8 ] A totally different situation was presented in  Ballard v. United States,   329 U. S. 187 , in which it was held that a litigant who had been a party respondent in a case previously here on certiorari had not lost his right to complain of error in the selection of a jury by failing to argue the error as an independent ground for sustaining the first decision of the Court of Appeals, holding in his favor on other grounds. Reference is also made to cases in which this Court has exercised its power to control the course of litigation immediately before it -- a power which finds an appropriate exercise in the avoidance of premature constitutional adjudication.  But the rule which petitioner urges, which would permit saving for a possible later stage in the proceedings errors available but not raised in this Court on review of administrative action, far from enhancing the Court's ability to give effect to the policy of deferring unnecessary constitutional decision, would impede that policy.  For it would allow the agencies and lower courts, after our remand, to consider potentially dispositive contentions which, had they been brought to our attention, might have derailed issues on which decision turned. The reason for demanding that all available issues be raised in the orderly course of administrative review proceedings is made particularly evident by the circumstances of this case.  This was a litigation already five years old when it first came here.  Unusually extensive hearings and argument had been had before the Board, and exhaustive briefing and argument before the Court of Appeals.  The petition for certiorari, a document of ninety-three pages plus appendices, presented ten major questions and innumerable subsidiary points.  Yet the matter of the Gitlow memoranda, which it is now argued looms so large in the context of this extraordinarily lengthy and complex proceeding, was not raised, and not raised by highly experienced lawyers who vigorously contended every step of the litigation.  We remanded on other grounds and now -- after five more years have passed, after the Board and the Court of Appeals have each twice more reconsidered this steadily growing record -- we are asked to reverse on a ground which the Party had every opportunity to bring here, but which it abandoned.  To ignore the abandonment would be a most artificial, decision-shrinking abuse of the wise rule of putting off decisions of constitutional scope.  Avoidance of such decisions, however compelling a policy within the limitations of ordered judicial regularity, ought not to be countenanced by grafting an  ad hoc  exception onto a generally applicable rule of appellate procedure and permitting particular litigants to avail themselves of otherwise uncognizable points.  No decision of this Court can be found which, in similar circumstances, authorizes disregard of all that has transpired over ten years of litigation so as to allow petitioner to make waste the half of it by resuscitating a long-stale claim. [ Footnote 9 ] ""Q:  Did you give [the Starobin letter incident] to . . . the FBI?"" ""A:  I am satisfied I gave it to the FBI.  I couldn't say definitely, but the FBI question me about everything I write and say, and also about many other things.  They question me, and I answer their questions."" ""Q: Were your answers reduced in writing?"" ""A:  As a matter of fact, I do know now, since you mention it, that I did give this to the FBI."" ""Q:  In writing?"" ""A:  No, not in writing."" ""Q:  Was it taken down by a stenographer?"" ""A:  No, not by a stenographer.  They never do that, except in rare cases."" ""Q:  Was a report written up and then shown to you afterwards?"" ""A:  No. That never happens."" ""Q: So all you did was simply have an oral conversation about this incident?"" ""A:  Yes, that is all."" "" *    *    *    *""  ""Q:  Was it recorded?"" ""A:  I judge so.  It was taken down."" ""Q:  It was taken down?"" ""A:  Yes. I mean, it wasn't by a stenographer, but by an FBI agent."" ""Q:  It was taken down by an agent?"" ""A:  Right."" ""Q:  Was it taken down in shorthand or longhand, or what?"" ""A:  Longhand."" ""Q:  When?"" ""A:  That I don't know.  The reason I recall it, counselor, if I may say so, is because, in connection with my book, everything that was in my book was gone over by the FBI, either before or after its publication. . . ."" "" *    *    *    *""  ""When I say 'gone over,' I mean the information was given to them."" [ Footnote 10 ] The Party did move, at the original Board hearing, for the production of certain reports by particular government witnesses which, it may be, would be comprehended among those sought by its 1959 motion for ""All statements . . . which were made by witnesses who testified for the Attorney General at the administrative hearing and which relate to the subject matters of their testimony."" As in the case of the Gitlow memoranda, the question of the Board's denials of these motions was not raised in the petition for certiorari here in 1955, and has thus been waived.  We note that one such motion was adverted to in a footnote in the Party's brief in this Court at that time, in connection with its argument that the Board erred in relying on the testimony of Scarletto; this and a similar footnote reference to denial of the Party's motion for production of statements of Budenz concerning the Starobin letter were the only mentions in the Party's 224-page brief of motions for production denied by the Board.  These were plainly insufficient to raise the issue here.  Supreme Court Rules 23, subd. 1(c), 40, subd. 1(d)(2). Nor can we agree that the Party was excused from the necessity of making appropriate motions before the Board respecting documents which it wanted produced because similar motions with respect to other documents had previously been denied.  Especially in administrative proceedings of this length and complexity, it is important that a party bring his particular requests explicitly to the attention of the agency and the reviewing courts. [ Footnote 11 ] A Committee Report pertinent to that Act, H.R.Rep. No. 2582, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 1, described the organizations at which it was directed as those ""substantially controlled or directed by a foreign power. . . ."" [ Footnote 12 ] Among these were the League of Nations; the Russo-Finnish War, 1939; the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact, 1939; attitude toward World War II before and after the German attack on the Soviet Union; dissolution of the Communist International, 1943; West Germany; the Italian election of 1948; North Atlantic Pact; control of atomic energy; election of Yugoslavia to the United Nations Security Council, 1949; Cardinal Mindszenty case, 1949; United Nations action in Korea; Communist China's intervention in Korea, 1950; seating of Communist China in the United Nations; Peace Treaty with Japan, 1951; peace in Korea. [ Footnote 13 ] The Party points out that, with respect to a major portion of the paired sets of exhibits put in through Dr. Mosely, the documents demonstrating the Communist Party's position bear earlier dates than those demonstrating the Soviet Union's position.  These exhibits were offered only as illustrative of the views which Dr. Mosely testified -- his expert opinion being based on a far wider selection of readings -- were those taken approximately contemporaneously by the Soviet and the Party in each instance.  The Government expressly disclaimed any attempt to establish chronological sequence between the announced positions of the two. [ Footnote 14 ] The committee reports and other authoritative legislative history pertinent to § 13(e)(2) are unilluminating in this connection.  It is significant that, on the occasion of a proposed House amendment which would have deleted the similar nondeviation consideration now found in § 13(f)(4) of the Act (pertaining to Communist front organizations), Mr. Nixon, who had been a leading proponent of the legislation in its several forms, argued that, ""if this particular standard is stricken out, it would be virtually impossible in many cases to get sufficient evidence before the Subversive Activities Control Board to justify a finding that an organization was a Communist front."" 96 Cong.Rec. 13764.  The implication is that Mr. Nixon, and presumably other proponents of the enactment, regarded the § 13(e) and (f) evidentiary considerations as expanding the scope of evidentiary matters of which the Board might take account in determining whether organizations met the definitions of § 3(3) and (4).  The proposed amendment was defeated after debate in the course of which all Congressmen seemed tacitly to assume that nondeviation involved a question of identity of policies, not of causal connection between policies.   Id.  at 13765-13768.   And see id.  at 14531-14533, 15194. [ Footnote 15 ] E.g.,  ""The article denounces the Japanese invasion of Manchuria as a clear and unprovoked act of aggression against China, does it not? . . .  Was [that] . . . not the opinion of every right-thinking person at that time?""  ""Is it not the universal opinion of every informed observer that the Greek monarchy is a reactionary, fascist and corrupt regime?""  ""Is it not true that virtually every Commentator on an analysis of the Italian elections in 1948 has expressed the opinion that there was widespread American intervention and interference in these elections? . . .  Was there not widespread interference on the part of the United States in that election?""  ""Was not this United States intervention in Formosa a violation of the Cairo Agreement on Formosa?""  ""Did not this policy [sending American troops beyond the 38th parallel in Korea] prove to be disastrous both militarily and politically? . . .  And was it not paid for in thousands of United States lives?"" [ Footnote 16 ] E.g.,  concerning Attorney General's Exhibit No. 284, a thirteen-page editorial: ""Q:  Petitioner's Exhibit 284 is an article . . . entitled, 'Wall Street's War Against the Korean People,' . . . is that not correct?"" ""A:  Yes, it is the subtitle of an editorial article."" ""Q:  Now, I call your attention to page 11.  Does not the author there say that broad democratic reforms were introduced in North Korea including universal sufferage [ sic ], the secret ballot, and equal status for women, and that the land was distributed to the peasants and that industry was nationalized and that the 8-hour day and social insurance were introduced, and child labor abolished and a system of public education introduced? . . .  Are these not correct statements of fact?"" [ Footnote 17 ] This question was put in a number of forms.  The most typical is the following: ""In your opinion, could an informed American observer, basing his views on what is the best interest of the American people, reasonably and sincerely conclude, one, that Mr. Malik's proposal was a great service to the cause of peace and in the best interests of the American people as well as all of the people of the world; two, that the representatives of the American government attempted to frustrate Mr. Malik's proposal but were forced into truce negotiations by the overwhelming desire of the people, and three, that American representatives, by provocative conduct and various pretexts, attempted to cause the breakdown of armistice negotiations in Korea?"" [ Footnote 18 ] E.g.,  ""Professor, is it not a fact that many non-communist commentators and observers have expressed the view that the American proposals for international control of atomic energy were designed to make it impossible for the Soviet Union to accept them, and that the American plan had no real chance of adoption?""  ""Would it not be accurate to state, Professor, that there was a very large and broad measure of agreement among the people and many of the leaders of both the Soviet Union and the United States on the need for the prompt establishment of a second front in Europe?"" [ Footnote 19 ] E.g.,  ""Is it not a fact, Professor, that the Federation of American Atomic Scientists urged that the United States abandon its proposal for the international ownership of atomic raw materials in the bulletin published by that organization in March, 1950?"" [ Footnote 20 ] One name appears in connection with six issues, writers in the New York Herald Tribune in connection with seven, President Franklin Roosevelt and George Bernard Shaw three each, etc.  Instances in which the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune are referred to merely as sources for the printed texts of speeches or statements by statesmen, officials, etc., are not included in this count. [ Footnote 21 ] It expressly declined to find a purpose to conceal foreign control. [ Footnote 22 ] For example, before an individual may be subjected to the penalties of §§ 8 and 15(a)(2), the Party must have failed to register, or failed to list him as a member, and he must subsequently have failed, within the allotted time, to register himself. [ Footnote 23 ] It was evident that the prohibitions of § 4(a) were so comprehensive that, as pointed out in the brief for the holding companies, ""it [was] . . . quite impossible for holding companies to continue in business, unregistered, in the face of these prohibitions.""  Nor could the companies cease to be holding companies, since § 4(a) made unlawful, under penalty up to 200,000, the distribution or public offering of utility securities by unregistered holding companies through the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or the sale of securities by such companies with reason to believe that those securities would be distributed or made the subject of public offering through the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce.  No doubt for this reason, the Court regarded § 4(a) as a ""penalty"" for failure to register, rather than as an independent regulatory scheme for unregistered holding companies.    See  303 U.S. at   303 U. S. 439 ,   303 U. S. 442 ,   303 U. S. 443 .  A decree requiring the holding companies to comply with §§ 4(a) and 5 was, in effect, a decree compelling it to register. [ Footnote 24 ] Section 3 of the Act authorized the Commission to exempt from any provision or provisions of the Act certain described classes of holding companies.  It was evident from the nature of Electric Bond and Share, as developed in that litigation, that it did not come within any of these categories, and the Court did not mention § 3 in its opinion. [ Footnote 25 ] The decree was without prejudice to any rights which the companies might have at law or in equity after registration, and left the companies free to challenge the validity of any provisions of the Act other than §§ 4(a) and 5.  In the present proceeding, of course, the Board's order does not operate to foreclose the Communist Party, or any other person adversely affected by provisions of the Subversive Activities Control Act, from subsequently challenging in appropriate proceedings other of the Act's provisions than those requiring the registration of Communist action organizations.

No. 1358, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 9: ""The committee gave serious consideration to the many well intentioned proposals which were before it which attempted to meet the problems by outlawing the Communist Party.  Proponents of this approach differed as to what they desired.  Some wanted to bar the Communist Party from the ballot in the elections.  Others would have made membership in the Communist Party illegal  per se. "" ""The committee believes that there are several compelling arguments against the outlawing approach.  There are grave constitutional questions involved in attempting to interfere with the rights of the States to declare what parties and individuals may qualify for appearance on the ballot.  To make membership in a specifically designated existing organization illegal  per se  would run the risk of being held unconstitutional on the grounds that such an action was legislative fiat."" ""Among other policy considerations which militate against this type of approach are the following:  "" ""(1) Illegalization of the party might drive the Communist movement further underground, whereas exposure of its activities is the primary need."" ""(2) Illegalization has not proved effective in Canada and other countries which have tried it."" ""(3) If the present Communist Party severs the puppet strings by which it is manipulated from abroad, if it gives up its undercover methods, there is no reason for denying it the privilege of openly advocating its beliefs in the way in which true political parties advocate theirs.  In politics, as well as sports, there are certain rules of the game which must be obeyed.  Daggers are out of order on the American playing field.  Undercover methods and foreign direction cannot be tolerated on the political field."" ""This legislation does not constitute, therefore, a fiat.  The Communist Party of the United States is not made guilty of any offense by reason of the enactment of the provisions of this act.  If, however, the Communist Party of the United States or any other party now in existence or to be formed. operates in such a way that it comes within the definitions and performs activities which are proscribed under the act, then the legislation will apply to it. . . .  If such a party changes its characteristics, then the objectives sought by the committee will have been accomplished."" [ Footnote 34 ] We need not consider now the decisions in which this Court has struck down regulations requiring not merely registration, but the securing of a license, issued either at the arbitrary discretion of licensing officials or by the application of licensing standards so broad or uncertain as to permit arbitrary action by officials, as prerequisite to the right to speak.   E.g., Staub v. Baxley,   355 U. S. 313 ;  Superior Films, Inc., v. Department of Education,   346 U. S. 587 ;  Gellin v. Texas,   343 U. S. 960 ;  Joseph Burstyn, Inc., v. Wilson,   343 U.

S. 147 ;  Hague v. C.I.O.,   307 U. S. 496 ;  Lovell v. Griffin,   303 U. S. 444 .  The present statute has no such licensing provision. [ Footnote 35 ] After the speech, Thomas had also solicited one individual, by name, to join the union.  The Court declined to decide whether such a solicitation, apart from the speech, might constitutionally have been made the basis of punishment for contempt.  323 U.S. at   323 U. S. 541 .  The state court's order adjudging Thomas in contempt imposed a single sentence for both ""solicitations,"" and the Court therefore regarded the statute, in this application, as restraining and punishing Thomas ""for uttering, in the course of his address, the general as well as the specific invitation.""

 FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner was convicted of violating the so-called membership clause of the Smith Act, which makes a felony the acquisition or holding of membership in any organization which advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence, knowing the purposes thereof.  The indictment charged that from January, 1946, to the date of its filing in 1954, the Communist Party of the United States was such an organization, and that, throughout that period, petitioner was a member thereof with knowledge of the Party's illegal purpose and a specific intent to accomplish overthrow of the Government ""as speedily as circumstances would permit.""  The jury was instructed that it could not convict unless it found that, within the 3-year limitation period, (1) the Party advocated the violent overthrow of the Government, in the sense of present ""advocacy of action"" to accomplish that end as soon as circumstances were propitious, and (2) petitioner was an ""active"" member of the Party, and not merely ""a nominal, passive, inactive or purely technical"" member, with knowledge of the Party's illegal advocacy and a specific intent to bring about violent overthrow ""as speedily as circumstances would permit."" Held:   A judgment of the Court of Appeals sustaining the conviction is affirmed.  Pp.   367 U. S. 205 -259. 1. Section 4(f) of the Internal Security Act of 1950, which provides, in part, that neither ""the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute  per se  a violation"" of that or any other criminal statute, did not repeal  pro tanto  the membership clause of the Smith Act by excluding from the reach of that clause membership in any Communist organization.

(a) The statute was correctly interpreted by the two lower courts.  Pp.   367 U. S. 221 -224. (b) As construed and applied, the membership clause of the Smith Act does not violate the Fifth Amendment by impermissibly   imputing guilt to an individual merely on the basis of his associations and sympathies, rather than because of some concrete personal involvement in criminal conduct.  Pp.   367 U. S. 224 -228. (c) As construed and applied, the membership clause of the Smith Act does not infringe freedom of political expression and association in violation of the First Amendment.  Pp.   367 U. S. 228 -230. 3. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.  Pp.   367 U. S. 230 -255. 4. None of the trial errors alleged by petitioner raises points meriting reversal.  Pp.   367 U. S. 255 -259. (a) The admission of evidence about the Party's program for inciting the Negro population in the South to revolt and the admission of a pamphlet called ""I Saw the Truth in Korea,"" which contained a very gruesome description of alleged American atrocities in Korea, were not prejudicial errors warranting reversal of the conviction.  Pp.   367 U. S. 255 -257. (b) The so-called Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, is not unconstitutional, and its application to petitioner in this case did not invalidate his conviction.  Pp.   367 U. S. 257 -258. (c) Petitioner has made no showing to sustain his contention that congressional findings as to the character of the Communist Party contained in the Communist Control Act of 1954 and the Internal Security Act of 1950 deprived him of a fair trial on that issue.  Pp.   367 U. S. 258 -259. (d) By his failure to comply with Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, petitioner waived any right he might have had to question the method of choosing grand jurors, and no impropriety in the method of choosing grand jurors has been shown.  P.   367 U. S. 259 . 260 F.2d 21, affirmed. "

 FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner was convicted of violating the so-called membership clause of the Smith Act, which makes a felony the acquisition or holding of membership in any organization which advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence, knowing the purpose thereof. Held:   the judgment is reversed, because the evidence was insufficient to prove that the Communist Party presently advocated forcible overthrow of the Government not as an abstract doctrine, but by the use of language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to action, immediately or in the future.  Pp.   369 U.S. 291 -300. (a) In order to support a conviction under the membership clause of the Smith Act, there must be some substantial direct or circumstantial evidence of a call to violence now or in the future which is both sufficiently strong and sufficiently pervasive to lend color to the otherwise ambiguous theoretical material regarding Communist Party teaching and to justify the inference that such a call to violence may fairly be imputed to the Party as a whole, and not merely to some narrow segment of it.  P.   367 U. S. 298 . (b) It is  present  advocacy, not an intent to advocate in the future or a conspiracy to advocate in the future, which is an element of the crime under the membership clause of the Smith Act.  P.   367 U. S. 298 . (c) A defendant must be judged upon the evidence in his own trial, and not upon the evidence in some other trial or upon what may be supposed to be the tenets of the Communist Party.  P.   367 U. S. 299 . 262 F.2d 501 reversed. "

Claiming that this requirement violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, he sued in a state court to compel issuance of his commission, but relief was denied.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the state constitutional provision is self-executing, without need for implementing legislation, and requires declaration of a belief in God as a qualification for office.

 Syllabus   Proceeding under certain Missouri statutes, as supplemented by a rule of the State Supreme Court, a city police officer appeared in a state trial court and filed a sworn complaint that each of the appellants, a wholesale distributor of magazines, newspapers and books and the operators of five retail newsstands, kept ""obscene"" publications for sale.  In an  ex parte  proceeding, without granting appellants a hearing or even seeing any of the publications in question, and without specifying any particular publications, the trial judge issued search warrants authorizing police officers to search appellants' premises and seize all ""obscene"" material.  Different police officers searched appellants' premises and, after hasty examination, seized all copies of all publications which, in their judgment, were obscene.  Nearly two weeks later, appellants were given a hearing, at which they moved to quash the search warrants, for return of the seized publications, and for suppression of their use in evidence, on the ground that their seizure violated the protection of free speech and press guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  These motions were denied, and, over two months after the seizure, the trial court found that 100 of the seized publications were obscene, and it ordered their destruction; but it also found that 180 other seized publications were not obscene, and it ordered them returned to their owners.  The State Supreme Court sustained the validity of these procedures, and an appeal was taken to this Court. Held: 1. This Court had jurisdiction of the appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1257(2).  P.   367 U. S. 721 . 2. The search and seizure procedures applied in this case lacked the safeguards to nonobscene material which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires to prevent erosion of the constitutional guaranties of freedom of speech and press, and the judgment is reversed.  Pp.   367 U. S. 729 -738. (a) Under the Fourteenth Amendment, a State is not free to adopt whatever procedures it pleases for dealing with obscenity   without regard to the possible consequences for constitutionally protected speech.  Pp.   367 U. S. 729 -731. (b) As applied in this case, Missouri's procedures confided to law enforcement officials broad discretion to seize allegedly obscene publications without adequate safeguards to assure nonobscene material the constitutional protection to which it is entitled.

 Syllabus   Acting in accordance with an Act of the State Legislature, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin promulgated rules and bylaws creating an integrated State Bar and requiring all lawyers practicing in the State to be members thereof and to pay annual dues of $15.  Appellant paid his dues under protest and sued for a refund, claiming that the State Bar engaged in political activities which he opposed, and that, by coercing him to support it, such rules and bylaws violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

 FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner was convicted in a Federal District Court of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 by swearing falsely that he was not a member of, or affiliated with, the Communist Party, in an affidavit filed with the National Labor Relations Board to enable a union of which he was an officer to comply with § 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Taft-Hartley Act.  At the trial, petitioner moved under 18 U.S.C. § 3500 for production, for use in cross-examination, of all statements given by two government witnesses relating to their testimony.  All narrative statements of both witnesses which related to their direct testimony were produced and made available to petitioner, but notes made by an FBI agent covering oral reports of one witness regarding his expenses and receipts signed by both witnesses for money paid to them for expenses were not produced, and they were not in the record before this Court.  In this Court, the Solicitor General represented that the notes covering oral reports of the witness regarding his expenses had been destroyed before the trial, that most of the receipts for expense money signed by the witnesses did not relate to anything mentioned in their direct testimony, and that, although some of the receipts contained information relating to the direct testimony of one of the witnesses, all such information had been made available to petitioner in the narrative statements of that witness. Held: 1. The judgment is vacated, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for a hearing and findings of fact on the issues raised by the Solicitor General's representations.  If the District Court finds that his representations are true in all material respects, it shall enter a new final judgment based upon the record as supplemented by its findings, thereby preserving to petitioner the right to appeal to the Court of Appeals.  If the District Court finds that the Solicitor General's representations are untrue in any material respect, it shall grant petitioner a new trial.  Pp.   368 U. S. 236 -244.  (a) If the agent's notes of the oral reports of expenses were made only for the purpose of transferring the data thereon to receipts to be signed by the witness, and if, after having served that purpose, they were destroyed in good faith and in accord with normal practice, their destruction did not constitute an impermissible destruction of evidence nor deprive petitioner of any right.  Pp.   368 U. S. 241 -242. (b) Petitioner would not be entitled to a new trial because of the nonproduction of those notes, if they were so destroyed and not in existence at the time of the trial.  P.   368 U. S. 242 . (c) Notwithstanding the fact that the receipts given by the witnesses for expense money were ""statements,"" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3500, and were demanded under that section, petitioner would not be entitled to a new trial because of their nonproduction if they did not relate to the direct testimony of those witnesses.  Pp.   368 U. S. 242 -243. (d) If some of the receipts did relate to the direct testimony of one witness, but the information contained in them had already been given to petitioner in the narrative statements of that witness, the District Court could properly find that the error in failing to produce those receipts was harmless.  Pp.   368 U. S. 243 -244. 2. The District Court's instructions to the jury (quoted in the opinion, p. 246,   n  5, and p. 254,   n  13) properly defined ""membership in,"" and ""affiliation with,"" the Communist Party.  Pp.   368 U. S. 242 -258. (a) Membership in such a secretly operating organization is, to all but the organization and its member or members, necessarily subjective, and, although it must be proved by evidence of objective facts and circumstances having a rational tendency to show, and from which the jury may rationally and logically infer, the ultimate subjective fact of membership, it is, in the very nature of such a case, necessary that the court's instructions define membership in such an organization in subjective terms or not at all.  P.   368 U. S. 249 . (b) The following definition of ""membership"" contained in the instructions was not erroneous: ""Membership in the Communist Party, the same as membership in any other organization, constitutes the state of being one of those persons who belong to or comprise the Communist Party.  It connotes a status of mutuality between the individual and the organization.  That is to say, there must be present the desire on the part of the individual to belong   to the Communist Party and a recognition by that Party that it considers him as a member."" Pp.   368 U. S. 249 -251. (c) The instructions did not fail adequately to state the objective circumstances that might be considered by the jury in determining membership, and the criteria submitted were not too indefinite to give the jury the necessary guidance.  Pp.   368 U. S. 251 -253. (d) Independently of, and wholly apart from, § 5 of the Communist Control Act of 1954, it was proper to tell the jury, as this instruction did, that, in determining whether the defendant was or was not a member of the Communist Party on the date charged in the indictment, they might consider 12 of the 14 criteria specified by Congress in § 5 of that Act.  Pp.   368 U. S. 252 -253. (e) The instructions did not allow a finding of membership on a date other than that charged in the indictment.  P.   368 U. S. 253 . (f) The instructions did not violate the First Amendment or deny due process by permitting the jury to base its finding of membership upon statements and acts that are protected by that Amendment.  Pp.   368 U. S. 253 -254. (g) The Court's instruction defining ""affiliation"" was correct.  Pp.   368 U. S. 254 -258. (h) The instruction was not erroneous for failure to advise the jury that one may not be ""affiliated with"" the Communist Party, within the meaning of § 9(h), by any direct relationship with the Party, but only by being a member of another organization that is affiliated with the Party.  Pp.   368 U. S. 256 -257. (i) The ultimate fact of affiliation, though subjective, may be proved by evidence of objective facts and circumstances having a rational tendency to show, and from which the jury may rationally and logically find, affiliation.  P.   368 U. S. 257 . (j) Though one paragraph of the instructions was erroneous and conflicted with another paragraph, it could not prejudice petitioner, because it exacted a higher standard of proof of affiliation than the law required.  Pp.   368 U. S. 257 -258. 275 F.2d 561, judgment vacated and case remanded for further proceedings. "

 Syllabus   A Florida statute requires every employee of the State and its subdivisions to swear in writing that,  inter alia,  he has never lent his ""aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist Party.""  It requires immediate discharge of any employee failing to subscribe to such an oath.  Appellant, a teacher in a public school of the State, refused to file such an oath and sued in a state court for a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement.  He alleged, in effect, that he had not done any of the things mentioned in the statute, as he understood it, but that its meaning was so vague as to deprive him of liberty or property without due process of law.  The State Supreme Court held the statute constitutional, and denied relief. Held: 1. Notwithstanding his allegation that he had not done any of the things mentioned in the required oath, appellant was not without standing to attack the statute on the ground that it was so vague as to deprive him of liberty or property without due process of law.  Pp.   368 U. S. 280 -285. 2. The meaning of the required oath is so vague and uncertain that the State cannot, consistently with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, force an employee either to take such an oath, at the risk of subsequent prosecution for perjury or face immediate dismissal from public service.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The petitioners in these six cases were convicted of violating 2 U.S.C. § 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned to testify before a committee of Congress to refuse to answer ""any question pertinent to the question under inquiry.""  In each case, the indictment returned by the grand jury stated that the questions to which answers were refused ""were pertinent to the question then under inquiry"" by the subcommittee; but it failed to identify the subject under subcommittee inquiry when the witness was interrogated.  In each case, a motion was filed to quash the indictment before trial for failure to state the subject under inquiry; but in each case, the motion was denied, and the issue thus raised was preserved and properly presented in this Court. Held:   the grand jury indictment required by 2 U.S.C. §194 as a prerequisite to a prosecution for a violation of § 192 must state the question which was under inquiry at the time of the defendant's alleged default or refusal to answer, as found by the grand jury, and the judgment affirming the conviction of each of the petitioners is reversed.  Pp.   369 U. S. 751 -772. (a) The Congress which originally enacted, in 1857, the law which was a predecessor of 2 U.S.C. §192 was expressly aware that pertinency to the subject under inquiry was the basic preliminary question which the federal courts would have to decide in determining whether a violation of the statute had been alleged or proved.  Pp.   369 U. S. 756 -758.  (b) Many decisions of this Court arising under 2 U.S.C. § 192 have recognized the crucial importance of determining the issue of pertinency, and the obvious first step in determining whether the questions asked were pertinent to the subject under inquiry is to ascertain what that subject was.  Pp.   369 U. S. 758 -760. (c) While convictions are no longer reversed because of minor and technical deficiencies which did not prejudice the accused, the substantial safeguards to those charged with serious crimes cannot be eradicated under the guise of technical departures from the rules.  Pp.   369 U. S. 760 -763. (d) Omission from the indictments here involved of statements of the subject under inquiry deprived the defendants of one of the significant protections which the guaranty of a grand jury indictment was intended to confer --  i.e.,  they failed adequately to apprise the defendants of what they must be prepared to meet.  Pp.   369 U. S. 763 -768. (e) These indictments were also insufficient to serve the corollary purpose of enabling the courts to decide whether the facts alleged were sufficient in law to support convictions.  Pp.   369 U.

(f) The deficiencies in these indictments could not have been cured by bills of particulars, because under 2 U.S.C. § 194, only a grand jury may determine whether a person should be held to answer in a criminal trial for refusing to give testimony pertinent to a question under congressional committee inquiry, and the grand jury itself must necessarily determine what the question under inquiry was.

 Syllabus   In the midst of a local political campaign, a County Judge, in the presence of representatives of news media assembled at the Judge's request, issued a charge to a grand jury giving it special instructions to investigate rumors and accusations of alleged bloc voting by Negroes and the rumored use of money by political candidates to obtain their votes.  The next day, while the grand jury was in session, petitioner, an elected Sheriff who was a candidate for reelection, issued from his office in the same building a press statement criticizing the Judge's action and urging citizens to take notice when their judges threatened political intimidation and persecution of voters under the guise of law enforcement.  Petitioner was cited in the County Court for contempt, on the ground that his statement was calculated to be contemptuous of the Court and to obstruct the grand jury in its investigation and that it constituted a ""clear, present and imminent danger"" to the administration of justice.  Petitioner issued a further statement repeating substantially his earlier charges and asserting that his defense would be that he had spoken the truth.  The contempt citation was then amended by the addition of another count based on this latter statement and a charge that it constituted a clear and present danger to the grand jury investigation and to the disposition of the contempt citation against him.  Without making any findings or giving any reasons for its conclusion that his conduct actually obstructed the grand jury or contempt proceedings, the trial court adjudged petitioner guilty of contempt and sentenced him to fine and imprisonment. Held:   The record does not support a finding that petitioner's statements presented a clear and present danger to the administration of justice; and his conviction violated his right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   After an administrative hearing, the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department issued a ruling barring a shipment of petitioners' magazines from the mails under 18 U.S.C. § 1461, on the grounds that (1) they were themselves ""obscene,"" and (2) they gave information as to where ""obscene"" matter could be obtained.  The magazines consisted largely of photographs of nude, or nearly nude, male models, and gave the name of each model and each photographer and the latter's address.  They also contained a number of advertisements by independent photographers offering for sale photographs of nude men.  The Judicial Officer found that the magazines (1) were composed primarily, if not exclusively, for homosexuals, and had no literary, scientific or other merit; (2) would appeal to the ""prurient interest"" of such sexual deviates, but would not have any interest for sexually normal individuals; (3) are read almost entirely by homosexuals, and possibly a few adolescent males; and (4) would not ordinarily be bought by normal male adults.  In a suit by petitioners, the District Court sustained the administrative ruling and denied injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   the judgment is reversed.  Pp.   370 U.

 Syllabus   1. Petitioner sued in a Federal District Court to enjoin enforcement of a Virginia statute on the ground that, as applied to it, the statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court abstained from passing on the validity of the statute pending an authoritative interpretation of it by the state courts, but it retained jurisdiction.  Petitioner then applied to a state court for a binding adjudication of all of its claims and a permanent injunction and declaratory relief, and it made no reservation to the disposition of the entire case by the state courts.  A state trial court held the statute to be both constitutional and applicable to petitioner, and this decision was affirmed by the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.  Petitioner then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, and this Court granted certiorari. Held:   The District Court's reservation of jurisdiction was purely formal; it did not impair the jurisdiction of this Court to review an otherwise final state court judgment; the judgment below was ""final,"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1257, and the case is properly before this Court.  Pp.   371 U. S. 427 -428. 2. Chapter 33 of the Virginia Acts of Assembly, Extra Sess. 1956, amended former statutes defining and punishing malpractice by attorneys so as to broaden the definition of solicitation of legal business to include acceptance of employment or compensation from any person or organization not a party to a judicial proceeding and having no pecuniary right or liability in it.  It also made it an offense for any such person or organization to solicit business for any attorney.  Petitioner, a corporation whose major purpose was the elimination of racial discrimination, sued in a state court to enjoin enforcement of this Chapter and for a declaratory judgment   that, as applied to petitioner, its affiliates, officers, members, attorneys retained or paid by it, and litigants to whom it might give assistance in cases involving racial discrimination, the Chapter violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court found that petitioner, through its State Conference, had formed a legal staff to direct actions pertaining to racial discrimination; urged the institution of suits to challenge racial discrimination; offered the services of attorneys selected and paid by it and its affiliates; and, with its affiliates, controlled the conduct of such litigation. Held:   The activities of petitioner, its affiliates and legal staff shown on this record are modes of expression and association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments which Virginia may not prohibit, under its power to regulate the legal profession, as improper solicitation of legal business violative of Chapter 33 and the Canons of Professional Ethics.  Pp.   371 U. S. 417 -445. (a) Although petitioner is a corporation, it may assert its right and that of its members and lawyers to associate for the purpose of assisting persons who seek legal redress for infringement of their constitutionally guaranteed rights.  P.   371 U. S. 428 . (b) Abstract discussion is not the only species of communication which the Constitution protects; the First Amendment also protects vigorous advocacy, certainly of lawful ends, against governmental intrusion.  P.   371 U. S. 429 . (c) In the context of petitioner's objectives, litigation is not a means of resolving private differences; it is a form of political expression, and a means for achieving the lawful objectives of equality of treatment by all governments, federal, state and local, for the members of the Negro community.  Pp.   371 U. S. 429 -430. (d) In order to find constitutional protection for the kind of cooperative, organizational activity disclosed by this record, it is not necessary to subsume such activity under a narrow, literal conception of freedom of speech, petition or assembly, for there is no longer any doubt that the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect certain forms of orderly group activity.  Pp.   371 U. S. 430 -431. (e) Under Chapter 33, as authoritatively construed by the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, a person who advises another that his legal rights have been infringed and refers him to a particular attorney or group of attorneys for assistance has committed a crime, as has the attorney who knowingly renders assistance under such circumstances; there thus inheres in the statute the gravest danger of smothering all discussion looking to the eventual institution of   litigation on behalf of the rights of Negroes; and, as so construed, Chapter 33 violates the Fourteenth Amendment by unduly inhibiting protected freedoms of expression and association.  Pp.   371 U. S. 431 -438. (f) It is no answer to the constitutional claims asserted by petitioner to say, as did the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, that the purpose of this statute was merely to insure high professional standards, and not to curtail freedom of expression, for a State may not, under the guise of prohibiting professional misconduct, ignore constitutional rights.  Pp.   371 U. S. 438 -439. (g) However valid may be Virginia's interest in regulating the traditionally illegal practices of barratry, maintenance and champerty, that interest does not justify the prohibition of petitioner's activities disclosed by this record.  Pp.   371 U. S. 439 -443. (h) Resort to the courts to seek vindication of constitutional rights is a different matter from the oppressive, malicious, or avaricious use of the legal process for purely private gain.  Pp.   371 U. S. 443 -444. (i) Although petitioner has amply shown that its activities fall within the protection of the First Amendment, the State has failed to advance any substantial regulatory interest, in the form of substantive evils flowing from petitioner's activities, which can justify the broad prohibitions which. it has imposed.  P.   371 U. S. 444 . 202 Va. 142, 116 S.E.2d 55, reversed."

Sullivan No. 118 Argued December 3, 1962 Decided February 18,1963 372 U.S. 58 APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT OF RHODE ISLAND
 Syllabus   The Rhode Island Legislature created a Commission ""to educate the public concerning any book . . . or other thing containing obscene, indecent or impure language, or manifestly tending to the corruption of the youth as defined [in other sections] and to investigate and recommend the prosecution of all violations of said sections."" The Commission's practice was to notify a distributor that certain books or magazines distributed by him had been reviewed by the Commission and had been declared by a majority of its members to be objectionable for sale, distribution or display to youths under 18 years of age.  Such notices requested the distributor's ""cooperation,"" and advised him that copies of the lists of ""objectionable"" publications were circulated to local police departments, and that it was the Commission's duty to recommend prosecution of purveyors of obscenity.  Four out-of-state publishers of books widely distributed in the State sued in a Rhode Island court for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that the law and the practices thereunder were unconstitutional.  The court found that the effect of the Commission's notices was to intimidate distributors and retailers and that they had resulted in the suppression of the sale of the books listed.  In this Court, the State Attorney General conceded that the notices listed several publications that were not obscene within this Court's definition of the term. Held:   The system of informal censorship disclosed by this record violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   372 U. S. 59 -72. (a) The Fourteenth Amendment requires that regulation by the States of obscenity conform to procedures that will ensure against the curtailment of constitutionally protected expression, which is often separated from obscenity only by a dim and uncertain line.  Pp.   372 U. S. 65 -66. (b) Although the Rhode Island Commission is limited to informal sanctions, the record amply demonstrates that it deliberately set about to achieve the suppression of publications deemed ""objectionable,"" and succeeded in its aim.  Pp.   372 U. S. 66 -67. (c) The acts and practices of the members and Executive Secretary of the Commission were performed under color of state law,   and so constituted acts of the State within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.  P.   372 U. S. 68 . (d) The Commission's practice provides no safeguards whatever against the suppression of nonobscene and constitutionally protected matter, and it is a form of regulation that creates hazards to protected freedoms markedly greater than those that attend reliance upon criminal sanctions, which may be applied only after a determination of obscenity has been made in a criminal trial hedged about with the procedural safeguards of the criminal process.  Pp.   372 U. S. 68 -70 (e) What Rhode Island has done, in fact, has been to subject the distribution of publications to a system of prior administrative restraints without any provision for notice and hearing before publications are listed as ""objectionable"" and without any provision for judicial review of the Commission's determination that such publications are ""objectionable.""  Pp.   372 U. S. 70 -72. Reversed and cause remanded."

 Syllabus   In a Florida State Court, petitioner, who was president of the Miami Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was adjudged in contempt and sentenced to fine and imprisonment for refusing to divulge contents of the membership records of that Branch to a committee created by the Florida Legislature, which was investigating the infiltration of Communists into various organizations.  There was no suggestion that the Association or its Miami Branch was a subversive organization, or that either was Communist dominated or influenced.  The purpose of the questions asked petitioner was to ascertain whether 14 persons previously identified as Communists or members of Communist front or affiliated organizations were members of the Miami Branch of the Association.  The principal evidence relied upon to show any relationship between the Association and subversive or Communist activities was indirect, ambiguous, and mostly hearsay testimony by two witnesses that, in years past, those 14 persons had attended occasional meetings of the Miami Branch of the Association ""and/or"" were members of that Branch, which had about 1,000 members. Held:   on the record in this case, petitioner's conviction of contempt for refusal to divulge information contained in the membership lists of the Association violated rights of association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   372 U. S. 540 -558. 1. When, as in this case, the claim is made that a legislative investigation intrudes upon First and Fourteenth Amendment associational rights of individuals, the State must show convincingly a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.

S. 72 , distinguished.  Pp.   372 U. S. 547 -550.  3. An adequate foundation for inquiry must be laid before a legislative investigation proceeds in such a manner as will substantially intrude upon and severely curtail or inhibit constitutionally protected associational rights, and the record in this case is not sufficient to show a substantial connection between the Miami Branch of the Association and Communist activities, or to demonstrate a compelling and subordinating state interest necessary to sustain the State's right to inquire into the membership lists of the Association.  Pp.   372 U. S. 550 -557. 4.

 Syllabus   Appellant, a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, was discharged by her South Carolina employer because she would not work on Saturday, the Sabbath Day of her faith.  She was unable to obtain other employment because she would not work on Saturday, and she filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits under the South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act, which provides that a claimant is ineligible for benefits if he has failed, without good cause, to accept available suitable work when offered him.  The State Commission denied appellant's application on the ground that she would not accept suitable work when offered, and its action was sustained by the State Supreme Court. Held:   As so applied, the South Carolina statute abridged appellant's right to the free exercise of her religion, in violation of the First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   374 U. S. 399 -410. (a) Disqualification of appellant for unemployment compensation benefits, solely because of her refusal to accept employment in which she would have to work on Saturday contrary to her religious belief, imposes an unconstitutional burden on the free exercise of her religion.  Pp.   374 U. S. 403 -406. (b) There is no compelling state interest enforced in the eligibility provisions of the South Carolina statute which justifies the substantial infringement of appellant's right to religious freedom under the First Amendment.  Pp.   374 U. S. 406 -409. (c) This decision does not foster the ""establishment"" of the Seventh-Day Adventist religion in South Carolina contrary to the First Amendment.  Pp.   374 U.

 Syllabus   Respondent, an elected official in Montgomery, Alabama, brought suit in a state court alleging that he had been libeled by an advertisement in corporate petitioner's newspaper, the text of which appeared over the names of the four individual petitioners and many others.  The advertisement included statements, some of which were false, about police action allegedly directed against students who participated in a civil rights demonstration and against a leader of the civil rights movement; respondent claimed the statements referred to him because his duties included supervision of the police department.  The trial judge instructed the jury that such statements were ""libelous  per se, "" legal injury being implied without proof of actual damages, and that, for the purpose of compensatory damages, malice was presumed, so that such damages could be awarded against petitioners if the statements were found to have been published by them and to have related to respondent.  As to punitive damages, the judge instructed that mere negligence was not evidence of actual malice, and would not justify an award of punitive damages; he refused to instruct that actual intent to harm or recklessness had to be found before punitive damages could be awarded, or that a verdict for respondent should differentiate between compensatory and punitive damages.  The jury found for respondent, and the State Supreme Court affirmed. Held:   A State cannot, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, award damages to a public official for defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves ""actual malice"" -- that the statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.  Pp.   376 U. S. 265 -292. (a) Application by state courts of a rule of law, whether statutory or not, to award a judgment in a civil action, is ""state action"" under the Fourteenth Amendment.  P.   376 U. S. 265 . (b) Expression does not lose constitutional protection to which it would otherwise be entitled because it appears in the form of a paid advertisement.  Pp.   376 U. S. 265 -266.  (c) Factual error, content defamatory of official reputation, or both, are insufficient to warrant an award of damages for false statements unless ""actual malice"" -- knowledge that statements are false or in reckless disregard of the truth -- is alleged and proved.  Pp.   376 U. S. 279 -283. (d) State court judgment entered upon a general verdict which does not differentiate between punitive damages, as to which, under state law, actual malice must be proved, and general damages, as to which it is ""presumed,"" precludes any determination as to the basis of the verdict, and requires reversal, where presumption of malice is inconsistent with federal constitutional requirements.  P.   376 U. S. 284 . (e) The evidence was constitutionally insufficient to support the judgment for respondent, since it failed to support a finding that the statements were made with actual malice or that they related to respondent.

 Syllabus   Alleging noncompliance with Alabama's corporate registration and business qualification laws, the State in 1956 brought ouster proceedings against the petitioner, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a New York membership corporation with an office in Alabama and doing business there, and it was barred under an  ex parte  restraining order from operating in the State.  Before any hearing on the merits, a contempt judgment, which the State Supreme Court on procedural grounds refused to review, was rendered against the NAACP for failure to produce its membership lists and other records under court order.  Without reaching the validity of the underlying restraining order, this Court reversed, and, following reinstatement by the State Supreme Court of the contempt judgment, reversed again.  In 1960, the NAACP, still prohibited from operating in Alabama, sued in a federal court alleging failure by the Alabama courts to afford it a hearing on the merits.  The case reached this Court a third time, and, in 1961, was remanded with instructions that the Federal District Court be directed to try the case on the merits unless the State did so by a certain time.  The State Circuit Court then heard the case; found that the NAACP had violated the State's constitution and laws; and permanently enjoined it from doing business in the State.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, solely on the basis of a procedural rule, which it applied to the NAACP's brief, that where unrelated assignments of error are argued together and one is without merit, the others will not be considered. Held: 1. There was substantial compliance with the procedural rule, and failure to consider petitioner's asserted constitutional rights was wholly unwarranted.  Pp.   377 U. S. 293 -302. 2. In view of what has gone before, this Court is deciding the case on its merits, rather than remanding it to the State Supreme Court for that purpose.  P.   377 U. S. 302 .  3. Alabama's corporate registration requirements are to ensure amenability of foreign corporations to suit in state courts, and do not provide for a corporation's permanent ouster for failure to register or because it engaged in other activities, which, in any event, furnished no proper basis for excluding the petitioner from Alabama.  Pp.   377 U. S. 302 -310. 4. This case does not involve the privilege of a corporation to do ""business"" in a State; it involves the freedom of individuals to associate for the collective advocacy of ideas.  P.   377 U. S. 309 . 5. While this Court has power to formulate a decree for entry in the state courts, as held in  Martin v. Hunter's Lessee ,  1 Wheat. 304, the case is remanded to the State Supreme Court for prompt entry of a decree vacating the permanent injunction order against petitioner and permitting it to operate in the State, failing which the NAACP may apply to this Court for further appropriate relief.  P.   377 U. S. 310 . 274 Ala. 544,  150 So. 2d 677 , reversed and remanded."

 FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
 Syllabus   This class action was brought by members of the faculty, staff, and students of the University of Washington for a judgment declaring unconstitutional 1931 and 1955 state statutes requiring the taking of oaths, one for teachers and the other for all state employees, including teachers, a a condition of employment.  The 1931 oath requires teachers to swear, by precept and example, to promote respect for the flag and the institutions of the United States and the State of Washington, reverence for law and order and undivided allegiance to the Government of the United States.  The 1955 oath for state employees, which incorporates provisions of the state Subversive Activities Act, requires the affiant to swear that he is not a ""subversive person"":  that he does not commit, or advise, teach, abet or advocate another to commit or aid in the commission of any act intended to overthrow or alter, or assist in the overthrow or alteration, of the constitutional form of government by revolution, force or violence.  ""Subversive organization"" and ""foreign subversive organization"" are defined in similar terms, and the Communist Party is declared a subversive organization.  A three-judge District Court held that the 1955 statute and oath were not unduly vague and did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and it abstained from ruling on the 1931 oath until it was considered by the state courts. Held: 1. The provisions of the 1955 statute and the 1931 Act violate due process, since they, as well as the oaths based thereon, are unduly vague, uncertain and broad.   Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction,   368 U. S. 278 , followed.  Pp.   377 U. S. 361 -372. 2. A State cannot require an employee to take an unduly vague oath containing a promise of future conduct at the risk of prosecution for perjury or loss of employment, particularly where the exercise of First Amendment freedoms may thereby be deterred.  Pp.   377 U. S. 373 -374. 3. Federal courts do not automatically abstain when faced with a doubtful issue of state law, since abstention involves a discretionary exercise of equity power.  Pp.   377 U. S. 375 -379.  (a) There are no special circumstances warranting application of the doctrine here.  P.   377 U. S. 375 . (b) Construction of the 1931 oath cannot eliminate the vagueness from its terms, and would probably raise other constitutional issues.  P.   377 U. S. 378 . (c) Abstention leads to piecemeal adjudication and protracted delays, a costly result where First Amendment freedoms may be inhibited.  Pp.   377 U. S. 378 -379. 215 F. Supp. 439 , reversed."

 Syllabus   A state statute defined obscenity, proscribed distribution of obscene materials, and authorized their seizure before, and their destruction after, an adversary determination of their obscenity.  Though the statute required the filing of a verified information by the county attorney or attorney general stating only that there ""is [an] . . . obscene book . . . located within his county,"" the information filed by the attorney general went further and identified by title 59 allegedly obscene novels which were stated to have been published under a certain caption; copies of seven novels published under that caption were filed with the information; and an  ex parte  inquiry was held by the district judge during which he ""scrutinized"" the seven books, concluding that they appeared obscene, and afforded grounds to believe that any paper-backed novels published under the same caption were obscene.  His warrant authorized seizure at the place of business of appellants' ""News Service"" of the novels identified by title in the Information.  Thirty-one of the titles were found on appellants' premises when the warrant was executed, and all 1,715 copies of them were seized.  At a hearing ten days after seizure, the court denied appellants' claim that, by failing to afford a pre-seizure hearing on the question whether the books were obscene, the statutory procedure operated as an unconstitutional prior restraint.  Following a final hearing held about seven weeks after seizure, the court held the 31 novels obscene and ruled that the seized copies should be destroyed on further order.  The State Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. Held:   the judgment of the State Supreme Court is reversed.  Pp.   378 U. S. 206 -215. 191 Kan. 13,  379 P.2d 254 , reversed."

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   Appellants, native-born citizens and residents of the United States, are ranking officials of the Communist Party of the United States.  After hearings under State Department regulations, appellants' passports were revoked under § 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, which provides that, when a Communist organization is registered, or under final order to register, it shall be unlawful for any member with knowledge or notice thereof to apply for or use a passport.  Appellants filed suit asking that § 6 be declared unconstitutional as a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and that the Secretary of State be ordered to issue passports to them.  A three-judge District Court denied relief. Held: 1. Section 6 is unconstitutional on its face, for it too broadly and indiscriminately transgresses the liberty guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   378 U. S. 505 -514. (a) The right to travel at home and abroad is an important aspect of liberty of which a citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law.   Kent v. Dulles,   357 U. S. 116 , followed.  P.   378 U. S. 505 . (b) Under existing laws, denial of a passport effectively prohibits travel anywhere in the world outside the Western Hemisphere.  P.   378 U. S. 507 . (c) Though the underlying purpose of § 6 is the protection of national security, the attainment of that end cannot be realized by unduly infringing upon constitutional freedoms.  Pp.   378 U. S. 508 -509. (d) Section 6 applies to every member of a ""Communist action"" or ""Communist front"" organization whether or not he believes or knows that he is associated with such an organization or that the organization seeks to further the aims of world Communism.  Pp.   378 U. S. 509 -510. (e) Also irrelevant under § 6 is the member's degree of activity and his commitment to the organization's purposes.  P.   378 U. S. 510 . (f) Section 6 creates an irrebuttable presumption that all members of Communist organizations will engage in activities endangering our security if given passports.  P.   378 U. S. 511 .  (g) The proscription of § 6 applies regardless of the traveler's purpose or destination.  Pp.   378 U. S. 511 -512. (h) Congress could have chosen less drastic means of achieving the national security objective without such sweeping abridgment of liberty.  Pp.   378 U. S. 512 -514. 2. Section 6 cannot be held constitutional as applied to these appellants, for such a ""construction"" would require substantial rewriting of the statute and would inject an element of vagueness into its scope.  Since freedom of travel is closely akin to freedom of speech and association, appellants should not be required to demonstrate that Congress could not have written a statute constitutionally prohibiting their travel.  Pp.   378 U. S. 515 -517. 219 F. Supp. 709 , reversed and remanded."

 Syllabus   Appellant, a District Attorney in Louisiana, during a dispute with certain state court judges of his parish, accused them at a press conference of laziness and inefficiency and of hampering his efforts to enforce the vice laws.  A state court convicted him of violating the Louisiana Criminal Defamation Statute, which, in the context of criticism of official conduct, includes punishment for true statements made with ""actual malice"" in the sense of ill-will, as well as false statements if made with ill-will or without reasonable belief that they were true.  The state supreme court affirmed the conviction, holding that the statute did not unconstitutionally abridge appellant's rights of free expression. Held: 1. The Constitution limits state power to impose sanctions for criticism of the official conduct of public officials, in criminal cases as in civil cases, to false statements concerning official conduct made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not.   New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , followed.  Pp.   379 U. S. 67 -75. 2. Appellant's accusations concerned the judges' official conduct and, did not become private defamation because they might also have reflected on the judges' private character.  Pp.   379 U.

 Syllabus   Appellant was the leader of a civil rights demonstration in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, of 2,000 Negro students protesting segregation and the arrest and imprisonment the previous day of other Negro students who had participated in a protest against racial segregation.  The group assembled a few blocks from the courthouse, where appellant identified himself to officers as the group's leader and explained the purpose of the demonstration.  Following his refusal to disband the group, appellant led it in an orderly march toward the courthouse.  In the vicinity of the courthouse, officers stopped appellant who, after explaining the purpose and program of the demonstration, was told by the Police Chief that he could hold the meeting so long as he confined it to the west side of the street.  Appellant directed the group to the west sidewalk, across the street from the courthouse and 101 feet from its steps.  There, the group, standing five feet deep and occupying almost the entire block but not obstructing the street, displayed signs and sang songs which evoked response from the students in the courthouse jail.  Appellant addressed the group. The Sheriff, construing as inflammatory appellant's concluding exhortation to the students to ""sit in"" at uptown lunch counters, ordered dispersal of the group which, not being directly forthcoming, was effected by tear gas.  Appellant was arrested the next day and was convicted of peace disturbance, obstructing public passages, and courthouse picketing.  The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the convictions, two of which (peace disturbance and obstructing public passages) are involved in this case; the third (courthouse picketing) being involved in No. 49,  post  at   379 U. S. 559 . Held: 1. In arresting and convicting appellant under the circumstances disclosed by this record, Louisiana deprived him of his rights of free speech and free assembly in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.   Edwards v. South Carolina,   372 U. S. 229 ;  Fields v. South Carolina,   375 U. S. 44 , followed.  Pp.   379 U. S. 544 -551. 2. The breach of the peace statute is unconstitutionally vague in its overly broad scope, for Louisiana has defined ""breach of the peace"" as ""to agitate, to arouse from a state of repose, to molest, to interrupt, to hinder, to disquiet""; yet one of the very functions of free speech is to invite dispute.   Terminiello v. Chicago ,     337 U. S. 1 ;  Stromberg v. California,   283 U. S. 359 , followed.  Pp.   379 U. S. 551 -552. 3. The practice in Baton Rouge of allowing local officials unfettered discretion in regulating the use of streets for peaceful parades and meetings notwithstanding the prohibitions contained in the statute against obstructing public passages abridged appellant's freedom of speech and assembly in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   379 U. S. 553 -558. (a) The Louisiana Supreme Court construed the obstructing public passages statute as applying to public assemblies which do not have the specific purpose of obstructing traffic.  P.   379 U. S. 553 .

(d) Communication of ideas by picketing and marching on streets is not afforded the same kind of protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments as is pure speech.  P.   379 U. S. 555 . (e) Although the statute, on its face, precludes all street assemblies and parades, the Baton Rouge authorities have not so enforced it, but, in their uncontrolled discretion, have permitted parades and street meetings.  Pp.   379 U. S. 555 -557. (f) The lodging of such broad discretion in public officials sanctions suppression of free expression and facilitates denial of equal protection.  Pp.   379 U.

 Syllabus 
 Appellant was convicted of violating a Louisiana statute prohibiting picketing ""near"" a courthouse with the intent to obstruct justice, the charge being based on the facts set forth in No. 24,  ante  at   383 U. S. 536 , and the conviction was upheld by the Louisiana Supreme Court. Held: 1. The statute is narrowly drawn, furthers the State's legitimate interest of protecting its judicial system from pressures which picketing near a courthouse might create, is a valid regulation of conduct, as distinguished from pure speech, and does not infringe rights of free speech and assembly.  Pp.   383 U. S. 562 -564. 2. Even assuming the applicability of a ""clear and present danger"" test, there is no constitutional objection to applying the statute to conduct of the sort engaged in by the demonstrators.  Pp.   383 U. S. 565 -566. 3. The evidence of intent to obstruct justice or influence any judicial official required by the statute was constitutionally sufficient.  Pp.   383 U. S. 566 -567. 4. Appellant was, in effect, advised by the city's highest police officials that a demonstration at the place where it was held was not ""near"" the courthouse, and to permit him to be convicted for exercising the privilege they told him was available would be to allow a type of entrapment violative of the Due Process Clause.   Raley v. Ohio,   360 U. S. 423 , followed.  Pp.   383 U. S. 569 -571. 5. The dispersal order did not limit the time or place of the demonstration and remove the protection accorded appellant by the original grant of permission, but was based on the officials' erroneous conclusion that appellant's remarks constituted a breach of the peace.

 Syllabus   Appellant was convicted of exhibiting a motion picture without submitting it to the Maryland State Board of Censors for prior approval, despite his contention that the motion picture censorship statute unconstitutionally impaired freedom of expression.  The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. Where motion pictures are concerned, a requirement of prior submission to a censorship board is not necessarily unconstitutional.   Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago,   365 U. S. 43 .  Pp.   380 U. S. 53 -54. 2. One can challenge a licensing statute which endangers freedom of expression whether or not his conduct could be prohibited by a properly drawn statute and whether or not he applied for a license.  P.   380 U. S. 56 . 3. There is a heavy presumption against the constitutional validity of prior restraints of expression.   Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,   372 U. S. 58 ,   370 U. S. 70 .  P.   380 U. S. 57 . 4. A noncriminal process requiring prior submission of a film to a censor avoids constitutional invalidity only with procedural safeguards designed to eliminate the dangers of censorship.  Pp.   380 U. S. 58 -60. (a) The censor must have the burden of proving that the film is expression unprotected by the Constitution.  P.   380 U. S. 58 . (b) Any restraint prior to judicial review must be limited to preservation of the  status quo  and for the shortest period compatible with sound judicial procedure.  Pp.   380 U. S. 58 -59. (c) A prompt final judicial determination of obscenity must be assured.  P.   380 U. S. 59 . 5. The absence in the Maryland procedure of adequate safeguards against undue inhibition of protected expression renders the statutory requirement of prior submission to censorship an invalid previous restraint.

 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA
 Syllabus   Appellants, a civil rights organization and its executive director, brought suit in Federal District Court, in which other individuals later joined, for injunctive and declaratory relief to restrain appellees from prosecuting or threatening to prosecute them under Louisiana's Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law and Communist Propaganda Control Law, which they alleged violated their rights of free expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Appellants contended that the statutes were excessively broad and susceptible of application in violation of those rights, and were being used by appellees in bad faith, not to secure valid convictions, but to deter appellants' civil rights efforts.  Appellants alleged and offered to prove the arrest of the individual appellants under the statutes, the raiding of their offices and illegal seizure of their records, with continued threats of prosecution after invalidation by a state court of the arrests and seizure of evidence preceding this action.  A three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, also holding that abstention was appropriate pending a possible narrowing.construction by the state courts which would avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication.  Thereafter, appellants alleged, the individual appellants were indicted under the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law.  They also claimed that there was no prospect of final state adjudications either under those indictments or under threatened additional prosecutions. Held: 1. The mere possibility of erroneous initial application of constitutional standards by a state court will not ordinarily constitute irreparable injury warranting federal interference with a good faith prosecution and the adjudication during its course of constitutional defenses.  Pp.   380 U. S. 484 -485.  2. But equitable relief will be granted to prevent a substantial loss or impairment of freedoms of expression resulting from prosecution under an excessively broad statute regulating expression.  Pp.   380 U. S. 485 -489. (a) Defense of a criminal prosecution will not generally assure ample vindication of First Amendment rights.   Baggett v. Bullitt,   377 U. S. 360 , followed.  Pp.   380 U. S. 485 -486. (b) A chilling effect upon First Amendment rights might result from such prosecution regardless of its prospects of success or failure, as is indicated by appellants' representations of the actions taken under the statutes.  Pp.   380 U. S. 487 -489. 3. The abstention doctrine is inappropriate where a statute is justifiably attacked on its face, or as applied for the purpose of discouraging protected activities.  Pp.   380 U. S. 489 -491. (a) The state court's ultimate interpretation of a statute would be irrelevant to meet the claim that it was being applied to discourage civil rights activities.  P.   380 U. S. 490 . (b) Abstention is inappropriate where a statute regulating speech is properly attacked on its face as being unconstitutionally vague.  Pp.   380 U. S. 490 -491. (c) Appellants are entitled to an injunction where, as here, no readily apparent construction is available to bring the statute within constitutional confines in a single prosecution, and it is not alleged that their conduct would fall within any conceivable narrowing construction.  P.   380 U. S. 491 . (d) The State must assume the burden of securing a permissible narrow construction of the statute in a noncriminal proceeding before it may seek modification of the injunction to permit future prosecutions thereunder.  P.   380 U. S. 491 . 4. The statutory definition of ""a subversive organization"" in § 359(5) of the Louisiana Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law, incorporated in the offense created by § 364(4), under which two of the individual appellants were indicted, results in an overly broad regulation of speech, invalid for the same reasons as held in  Baggett v. Bullitt, supra,  which involved a substantially similar definition.  Pp.   380 U. S. 493 -494. 5. Section 364(7), creating an offense for failure to register as a member of a ""Communist Front Organization,"" under which each of the individual defendants was indicted, is, on its face, invalid because of its constitutionally impermissible presumption of such status if the organization had been cited as a Communist front   by designated federal instrumentalities, there being no requirement in the statute of compliance in the process of such citation with procedural safeguards as demanded by  Anti-Facist Committee v. McGrath,   341 U. S. 123 .  Pp.   380 U. S. 494 -496. 6. The District Court shall enjoin prosecution of the pending indictments against the individual appellants, order immediate return of documents seized, and prohibit further enforcement of the sections of the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law here found void on their face.  Without abstention, it shall decide what relief appellants may be entitled to on the basis of their attacks on other sections of that statute, their attacks on the Communist Propaganda Control Law, and the remaining issues raised in the complaint.  Pp.   380 U. S. 497 -498. 27 F. Supp. 556 , reversed and remanded."

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Since the order of the Subversive Activities Control Board, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, requiring that petitioner register as a ""Communist front"" organization was based upon evidence at a hearing which ended in 1955 which related largely to the activities of one individual who died prior to the Board's order, the judgment is vacated and the cause remanded to determine petitioner's current status. 117 U.S.App.D.C. 393, 331 F.2d 53, vacated and remanded. PER CURIAM. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board requiring that the petitioner register as a ""Communist front"" organization under § 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, as amended, 64 Stat. 993, 50 U.S. C. § 786 (1958 ed.).  117 U.S.App.D.C. 393, 331 F.2d 53.  We granted certiorari.  377 U.S. 915.  Under the statute, a determination that an organization is a Communist front must rest on findings that it ""(A) is substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by a Communist action organization, and (B) is primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to a Communist action organization . . ."" § 3(4), 64 Stat. 989, 50 U.S.C. § 782(4) (1958 ed.).  In  Communist Party of United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board,   367 U. S. 1 , this Court sustained the Board's determination that the Communist Party is a ""Communist action organization"" within the meaning of § 3(3) of the Act; in doing so, the Court upheld the registration requirement against First Amendment attack, and found an objection based on the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination not ripe for decision. In the present case, the Board's findings that petitioner is a ""Communist front"" were based primarily upon evidence taken at a hearing which was concluded in 1955.  The findings which support the conclusion that the petitioner is controlled by and primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to the Communist Party rest in substantial measure upon evidence of the activities of Abner Green, found to be a Party member expressly assigned in 1941 to be petitioner's executive secretary.  Green died in 1959.  The Board's order was filed on June 27, 1960, but the record discloses no findings or evidence concerning petitioner's activities after Green's death. [ Footnote 1 ]  In the circumstances, we think that the record   should be brought up to date to take account of supervening events.  Since a registration order operates prospectively, it is apparent that reasonably current aid and control must be established to justify a registration order.  Our  Communist Party  decision on the Communist action provisions did not necessarily foreclose petitioner's constitutional questions bearing on the Communist front provisions. [ Footnote 2 ]  Since petitioner's current status is not clear on this record, decision of the serious constitutional questions raised by the order is neither necessary nor appropriate.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the cause remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered."

 Syllabus   After this country had broken diplomatic relations with Cuba and the Department of State had eliminated Cuba from the area for which passports were not required, appellant applied to have his passport validated for travel to Cuba ""to satisfy [his] curiosity . . . and to make [him] a better informed citizen.""  His request was denied, and he filed suit in federal district court seeking a judgment declaring that he was entitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States to travel to Cuba and to have his passport validated for that purpose, that the Secretary of State's travel restrictions were invalid, and that the Passport Act of 1926 and § 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 were unconstitutional.  In addition, he prayed that the Secretary and the Attorney General he enjoined from interfering with such travel.  A three-judge court granted the Secretary's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action against the Attorney General. Held: 1. Since the complaint launched a substantial constitutional attack upon two federal statutes and prayed that their operation be enjoined, the three-judge court was properly convened.  Pp.   381 U. S. 5 -7. 2. The Passport Act of 1926 grants authority to the Executive to refuse validation of passports for Cuban travel.  Pp.   381 U. S. 7 -13. (a) The consistent interpretation by the Department of State of its authority to impose area restrictions, both before and after   the 1926 enactment, must be given weight by the courts in construing the statute.  Pp.   381 U. S. 8 -11. (b) In 1952, Congress enacted legislation relating to passports, but, despite the many executive impositions of area restrictions, it left untouched the broad rulemaking authority granted in the Passport Act of 1926.  P.   381 U. S. 12 . (c) This case, where the Secretary's refusal is based on foreign policy considerations affecting all citizens, is distinguished from  Kent v. Dulles,   357 U. S. 116 , where the passport denial was based on the applicant's political beliefs or associations.  Pp. 12-13. 3.

 FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 Syllabus   These cases challenge the constitutionality of § 305(a) of the Postal Service and Federal Employees Salary Act of 1962, which requires the Postmaster General to detain and deliver only upon the addressee's request unsealed foreign mailings of ""communist political propaganda.""  Under procedure effective March 15, 1965, the Post Office sends to the addressee a card which can be checked to have the mailing delivered.  The card states that, if it is not returned within 20 days, it will be assumed that the addressee does not want that publication or any similar one in the future.  When the addressee in these cases received the Post Office notices, they sued to enjoin enforcement of the statute. Held:   the Act, as construed and applied, is unconstitutional, since it imposes on the addressee an affirmative obligation which amounts to an unconstitutional limitation of his rights under the First Amendment.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Despite the order of the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB), sustained in  Communist Party of the United States v. SACB,   367 U. S. 1 , the Party failed to register under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, and no list of members was filed.  The Attorney General, in accordance with § 13(a) and §§ 8(a) and (c) of the Act, asked the SACB to order petitioners, as Party members, to register and submit a registration statement.  The SACB did order petitioners to register and submit the registration statement, and the Court of Appeals affirmed these orders, finding the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination issue not ripe for adjudication. Held: 1. Petitioners' claims of the privilege against self-incrimination are ripe for adjudication.  Pp.   382 U. S. 73 -77. (a) As distinguished from the  Communist Party  case, the contingencies upon which the members' duty to register arises have matured, the petitioners have claimed the privilege, and the Attorney General has rejected such claims.  Pp.   382 U. S. 74 -75. (b) Petitioners are faced with the choice of registering without a decision on the merits of their claims or subjecting themselves to serious punishment.  Pp.   382 U. S. 75 -76. (c) Respondent's attempt to distinguish between claims of privilege relating to the SACB's power to compel registration and submission of a registration statement, concerning which it concedes that the Court of Appeals' holding of prematurity was erroneous, and claims of privilege against ""any particular inquiry"" on the registration form or registration statement, is without merit.  The statute and regulations issued thereunder require petitioners to register and submit the forms fully executed in accordance with present regulations.  Pp.   382 U. S. 76 -77. 2. The requirement of filing the registration form (IS-52a) is incriminatory within the meaning of the Self-Incrimination Clause because the admission of Party membership, required by the form, might be used as an investigatory lead to or evidence in a criminal prosecution.  Pp.   382 U. S. 77 -78.  3. The requirement of completing and filing the registration statement (IS-52), considered apart from the registration form, would also be incriminatory because the information might be used as evidence in, or supply leads to, a criminal prosecution.   United States v. Sullivan,   274 U. S. 259 , distinguished.  Pp.   382 U. S. 78 -79. 4. The Act's immunity provision, § 4(f), does not save the orders to register from petitioners' Fifth Amendment challenge.  Pp.   382 U. S. 79 -81. (a) The immunity provision does not preclude the use of information called for by the registration statement (IS-52) either as evidence or an investigatory lead.  P.   382 U. S. 80 . (b) The immunity provision does not preclude the use of an admission of Party membership on the registration form (IS-52a) as an investigatory lead, a use barred by the self-incrimination privilege.  P.   382 U. S. 80 . (c) Respondent's argument that, since an order to register follows an SACB finding of Party membership, the admission of Party membership by registering is of no investigatory value, and thus not ""incriminatory,"" would make the right to invoke the privilege depend upon an assessment of information in the Government's possession.  This would negate the complete protection from all perils that an immunity statute must provide according to  Counselman v. Hitchcock,   142 U. S. 547 .

Baer No. 38 Argued October 20, 1965 Decided February 21, 1966 383 U.S. 75 CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
 Syllabus   Respondent, the former supervisor of a county recreation area who was employed by and responsible to the three county Commissioners, brought this civil libel action in a New Hampshire state court against petitioner whose newspaper column allegedly criticized the fiscal management of the area under respondent's regime and asked the questions, ""What happened to all the money last year? and every other year?""  Respondent offered extrinsic proofs that the column imputed mismanagement and speculation during respondent's tenure on the theories (1) that the jury could award respondent damages if it found that the column cast suspicion indiscriminately on the former small management group, whether or not it attributed the misconduct specifically to respondent, and (2) that the column was read as specifically referring to respondent as the person responsible for the area's financial affairs.  The jury was instructed that ""an implication of crime to one or some of a small group that casts suspicion on all is actionable,"" and that defamatory comment was justified if made without malice and represented fair comment on matters of public interest, ""malice"" being defined to include ""ill will, evil motive, intention to injure . . . ,"" and the jury was permitted to find that negligent misstatement of fact would defeat petitioner's privilege of free expression.  The jury awarded respondent damages, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, finding no bar in  New York Times Co v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , which had been decided after the trial. Held: 1. An otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations cannot be used to establish defamation of those administering such operations absent evidence that the implication of wrongdoing was read as specifically directed at the plaintiff, whether he is considered a public official or a member of a group responsible for governmental operations, and whether or not others were also implicated.  The trial judge's instruction was erroneous to the extent that it authorized the jury to award respondent damages without regard to evidence that the asserted implication of the   column was made with specific reference to him.   New York Times, supra,  followed.  Pp.   383 U. S. 79 -83. 2. A government employee, having or appearing to the public to have substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs, is a ""public official,"" and, as such, under  New York Times, supra,  and  Garrison v. Louisiana,   379 U. S. 64 , cannot recover damages for defamatory comment about his official conduct unless he proves actual malice,  i.e.,  that such comment is made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it is true or false.  Pp.   383 U. S. 84 -86. (a) Whether a person is a ""public official"" as that term is used in  New York Times  is not determined under state law standards.  P.   383 U. S. 84 . (b) The term ""public official"" should be interpreted in the light of the compelling interest in debate on public issues and about those persons who are in a position to resolve those issues, though it is not necessary here, any more than it was in  New York Times,  to delineate the precise scope of the term.  P.   383 U. S. 85 . (c) The protections which the law of defamation affords must be limited by the constitutional protections for public discussion.  P.   383 U. S. 86 . 3. Since  New York Times  had not been decided at the time of the trial of this case, respondent should be allowed to adduce proof that his claim falls outside the rule of that decision, or that petitioner's comment was made with malice as defined therein, and, on retrial, it will be for the trial judge in the first instance to determine if the proofs show that respondent was a ""public official.""

 FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner Ginzburg and three corporations which he controlled were convicted of violating the federal obscenity statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1461, by mailing three publications:  an expensive hardcover magazine dealing with sex, a sexual newsletter, and a short book purporting to be a sexual autobiography.  The prosecution charged that these publications were obscene in the context of their production, sale, and attendant publicity.  Besides testimony as to the merit of the material, abundant evidence was introduced that each of the publications was originated or sold as stock in trade of the business of pandering,  i.e.,  the purveying of publications openly advertised to appeal to the customers' erotic interest.  Mailing privileges were sought from places with salaciously suggestive names; circulars for the magazine and newsletter stressed unrestricted expression of sex, and advertising of the book which purported to be of medical and psychiatric interest, but whose distribution was not confined to a professional audience, dwelt on the book's sexual imagery.  In finding petitioners guilty, the trial judge applied the obscenity standards first enunciated in  Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 , and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   Evidence that the petitioners deliberately represented the accused publications as erotically arousing and commercially exploited them as erotica solely for the sake of prurient appeal amply supported the trial court's determination that the material was obscene under the standards of the  Roth  case,  supra.   The mere fact of profit from the sale of the publication is not considered; but, in a close case, a showing of exploitation of interests in titillation by pornography with respect to material lending itself to such exploitation through pervasive treatment or description of sexual matters supports a determination that the material is obscene.  Pp.   383 U. S. 470 -476. 338 F.2d 12, affirmed. "

 Syllabus   Petitioner was indicted and convicted for violating the Kentucky common law crime of criminal libel.  The indictment charged ""the offense of criminal libel"" committed ""by publishing a false and malicious publication which tends to degrade or injure"" three named persons.  The trial court charged that ""criminal libel is defined as any writing calculated to create disturbances of the peace, corrupt the public morals, or lead to any act which, when done, is indictable."" The court also charged that malice and falsity were essential elements of the offense.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals, in affirming the conviction, ruled that breach of the peace is not a constitutional basis for imposing criminal liability, and held that common law criminal libel is ""the publication of a defamatory statement about another which is false, with malice."" Held: 1. Where an accused is convicted under a broad construction of a law which would make it unconstitutional, the conviction cannot be sustained on appeal by a limiting construction which eliminates the unconstitutional features of the law.   Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham,   382 U. S. 87 .  P.   384 U. S. 198 . 2. Because the offense was defined at trial as the publication of a writing calculated to disturb the peace, petitioner was judged by an unconstitutionally vague standard which required calculations as the the reaction of the audience to which the publication was addressed. 3.

 Syllabus   Appellant, a Birmingham, Alabama, newspaper editor, was arrested on a complaint of violating § 285 of the Alabama Corrupt Practices Act by writing and publishing on election day an editorial urging adoption in that election of the mayor-council form of government.  Section 285 proscribes electioneering or soliciting votes on election day for or against any proposition or candidate involved in the election.  The trial court sustained demurrers on the grounds that the statute violated state and federal free speech guarantees.  The Alabama Supreme Court, holding the statutory election-day restriction reasonable or ""within the field of reasonableness,"" reversed and remanded the case for trial. Held: 1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.  Notwithstanding the remand of the case, the Alabama Supreme Court's judgment was ""final"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1257, because appellant's conviction in any subsequent trial is inevitable in view of that court's ruling that the Alabama statute is constitutional and appellant's concession that he wrote and published the editorial.  Pp.   384 U. S. 217 -218. 2. A state statute making it a crime for a newspaper editor to publish an editorial on election day urging people to vote in a particular way flagrantly violates the First Amendment, applied to the States by the Fourteenth, a major purpose of which was to protect free discussion of governmental affairs.

 OF FLORIDA, FIRST DISTRICT
 Syllabus   Petitioners, 32 students, were members of a group of about 200 who on a nonpublic jail driveway, which they blocked, and on adjacent county jail premises had, by singing, clapping, and dancing, demonstrated against their schoolmates' arrest and perhaps against segregation in the jail and elsewhere.  The sheriff, the jail's custodian, advised them that they were trespassing on county property and would have to leave or be arrested.  The 107 demonstrators refusing to depart were thereafter arrested and convicted under a Florida trespass statute for ""trespass with a malicious and mischievous intent.""  Petitioners contend that their convictions, affirmed by the Florida Circuit Court and the District Court of Appeal, deprived them of their ""rights of free speech, assembly, petition, due process of law and equal protection of the laws"" under the Fourteenth Amendment. Held: 1. The Florida trespass statute, here applied to a demonstration on the premises of a jail, which is built for security purposes and is not open to the public, is aimed at conduct of a limited kind, and is not unconstitutionally vague, as were the common law breach of the peace statutes invalidated in  Edwards v.

 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA
 Syllabus   Several months after the election in June 1965 to the Georgia House of Representatives of appellant Bond, a Negro, a civil rights organization of which he was a staff member issued an anti-war statement against the Government's Vietnam policy and the operation of the Selective Service laws.  Bond endorsed the statement in a news interview stating, among other things, that, as ""a second class citizen,"" he was not required to support the war, as a pacifist, he was opposed to all war, and he saw nothing inconsistent with his statement and his taking the oath of office.  House members, in petitions, challenged Bond's right to be seated, charging that his statements aided our enemies, violated the Selective Service laws, discredited the House, and were inconsistent with the legislator's mandatory oath to support the Constitution.  Following the House clerk's refusal to seat him, Bond, manifesting willingness to take the oath, challenged the petitions as depriving him of his First Amendment rights and being racially motivated.  At a House committee hearing, Bond amplified his views and denied having urged draft card burning or other law violations.  Following the hearing, the committee concluded that Bond should not be seated, and the House thereafter refused to seat him.  Bond brought this action in District Court for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment.  The District Court, holding that it had jurisdiction to decide the constitutional issue, concluded that Bond had been accorded procedural due process through the hearing.  It also held that the House had a rational basis for concluding that Bond's remarks exceeded criticism of national policy and that he could not in good faith take an oath to support the State and Federal Constitutions, and thus could not meet a qualification for membership which the House had the power to impose.  While Bond's appeal to this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1253 from that decision was pending, he was again elected as a Representative, in a special election.  He was rejected by the House Rules Committee   when he declined to recant, and later was elected again, in the regular 1966 primary and general elections. Held: 1. This Court has jurisdiction to determine whether a disqualification for the office of state legislator under color of a proper constitutional standard violates First Amendment rights.  P.   385 U. S. 131 . 2. In disqualifying Bond because of his statements, the State violated the First Amendment made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  Pp.   385 U. S. 131 -137. (a) A majority of state legislators is not authorized to test the sincerity with which another duly elected legislator meets the requirement for holding office of swearing to support the Federal and State Constitutions.  P.   385 U. S. 132 . (b) The State may not apply to a legislator a First Amendment standard stricter than that applicable to a private citizen.  Pp.   385 U. S. 132 -133. (c) Bond's statements do not show an incitement to violate the Selective Service statute's prohibition of counseling against registration for military service.  Pp.   385 U. S. 133 -134. (d) Though a State may impose all oath requirement on legislators, it cannot limit their capacity to express views on local or national policy.

 Syllabus   Appellee, Hill, and his family, in 1952, were held hostage in their home by some escaped convicts, and were ultimately released unharmed without any violence having occurred.  They later moved away, and appellee discouraged further publicity efforts about the incident, which had caused extensive involuntary notoriety.  A novel about a hostage incident, but depicting considerable violence, later appeared, and was subsequently made into a play, these portrayals having been shaped by several incidents.  Appellant's magazine, Life, published an account of the play, relating it to the Hill incident, describing the play as a reenactment, and using as illustrations photographs of scenes staged in the former Hill home.  Alleging that the Life article gave the knowingly false impression that the play depicted the Hill incident, appellee sued for damages under a New York statute providing a cause of action to a person whose name or picture is used by another without consent for purposes of trade or advertising.  Appellant maintained that the article concerned a subject of general interest, and was published in good faith.  The trial court instructed the jury that liability under the statute depended upon a finding that the Life article was published not to disseminate news, but as a fictionalized version of the Hill incident and for the purpose of advertising the play or increasing the magazine's circulation.  The court also instructed the jury that punitive damages were justified if the jury found that the appellant falsely connected Hill with the play knowingly or through failure to make a reasonable investigation, and that personal malice need not be found if there was reckless or wanton disregard of Hill's rights.  The jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages.  Though liability was sustained on appeal, the Appellate Division ordered a new trial as to damages, at which only compensatory damages were awarded, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  The New York courts have limited the reach of the statute as applied to reports of newsworthy persons or events, and have made it clear since reargument here that truth is a complete defense.  ( Spahn v. Julian Messner, Inc.,  18   N.Y.2d 324, 221 N.E.2d 543 (1966)).  However, the New York courts allow recovery under the statute when such reports are ""fictitious."" Held: 1. Constitutional protections for free expression preclude applying New York's statute to redress false reports of newsworthy matters absent proof that the publisher knew of their falsity or acted in reckless disregard of the truth.   Cf. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 .  Pp.   385 U. S. 380 -391. (a) Erroneous statements about a matter of public interest, like the opening of a new play linked to an actual incident, which was the subject of the Life article, are inevitable, and, if innocent or merely negligent, must be protected if ""freedoms of expression are to have the  breathing space' that they 'need to survive. . . .'""   Id.  at   376 U. S. 271 -272.  Pp.   385 U. S. 388 -389.
 (b) But constitutional guarantees of free expression can tolerate sanctions against calculated falsehood without impairment of their essential function.  P.   385 U. S. 389 . 2. Since the evidence in this case would support a jury finding either (1) that appellant's inaccurate portrayal of the Hill incident was innocent or merely negligent or (2) that it was recklessly untrue or knowingly false, the trial court's failure properly to instruct the jury that a verdict of liability could be predicated only on a finding of knowing or reckless falsity in the publication of the Life article constituted reversible error.  Pp.   385 U. S. 391 -397. 3. A declaration would be unwarranted that the New York statute is unconstitutional on its face even if construed by the New York courts to impose liability without proof of knowing or reckless falsity, because the New York courts have been assiduous to construe the statute to avoid invasion of freedom of speech and of the press.  P.   385 U. S. 397 . 15 N.Y.2d 986, 207 N.E.2d 604, reversed and remanded. "

Board of Regents No. 105 Argued November 17, 1966 Decided January 23, 1967 385 U.S. 589 APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
 FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 Syllabus   Appellants, faculty members of the State University of New York and a non-faculty employee, brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that New York's teacher loyalty laws and regulations are unconstitutional.  Their continued employment had been terminated or was threatened when each appellant faculty member refused to comply with a requirement of the University trustees that he certify that he was not a Communist and that, if he had ever been one, he had so advised the university president, and the non-faculty employee refused to state under oath whether he had advocated or been a member of a group which advocated forceful overthrow of the government.  Under § 3021 of New York's Education Law, ""treasonable or seditious"" utterances or acts are grounds for dismissal from the public school system, as well as under § 105, subd. 3, of the Civil Service Law.  Other provisions of § 105 of the Civil Service Law disqualify from the civil service or employment in the educational system any person advocating or involved with the distribution of written material which advocates the forceful overthrow of the government.  Section 3021 does not define ""treasonable or seditious.""  Section 105, subd. 3, provides that ""treasonable word or act"" shall mean ""treason"" as defined in the Penal Law, and ""seditious word or act"" shall mean ""criminal anarchy"" as therein defined.  Section 3022 (the Feinberg Law) of the Education Law requires the State Board of Regents to issue regulations for the disqualification or removal on loyalty grounds of faculty or other personnel in the state educational system, to make a list of ""subversive"" organizations, and to provide that membership therein constitutes  prima facie  evidence of disqualification for employment.  The Board listed the National and State Communist Parties as ""subversive organizations"" under the law, but, shortly before the trial of this case, the university trustees' certificate requirement was rescinded and it was announced that no person would be ineligible for employment ""solely"" because he refused to sign the   certificate, and that §§ 3021 and 3022 of the Education Law and § 105 of the Civil Service Law constituted part of the employment contract.  A three-judge District Court sustained the constitutionality of these provisions against appellants' challenges of vagueness and overbreadth and dismissed the complaint. Held: 1.  Adler v. Board of Education,   342 U. S. 485 , in which this Court upheld some aspects of the New York teacher loyalty plan before its extension to state institutions of higher learning, is not controlling, the vagueness issue presented here involving § 3021 and § 105 not having been decided in  Adler,  and the validity of the subversive organization membership provision of § 3022 having been upheld for reasons subsequently rejected by this Court.  Pp.   385 U. S. 593 -595. 2. The rescission of the certificate requirement does not moot this case, as the substance of the statutory and regulatory complex challenged by appellants remains.  P.   385 U. S. 596 . 3. Section 3021 of the Education Law and § 105, subds. 1(a), 1(b), and 3, of the Civil Service Law, as implemented by the machinery created pursuant to § 3022 of the Education Law, are unconstitutionally vague, since no teacher can know from § 3021 of the Education Law and § 105, subd. 3, of the Civil Service Law what constitutes the boundary between ""seditious"" and nonseditious utterances and acts, and the other provisions may well prohibit the employment of one who advocates doctrine abstractly, without any attempt to incite others to action, and may be construed to cover mere expression of belief.  Pp.   385 U. S. 597 -604. (a) These provisions, which have not been interpreted by the New York courts, can have a stifling effect on the ""free play of the spirit which all teachers ought especially to cultivate and practice"" ( Wieman v. Updegraff,   344 U. S. 183 ,   344 U. S. 195  (concurring opinion)).  Pp.   385 U. S. 601 -602. (b) Academic freedom is a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.  P.   385 U. S. 603 . (c) The prolixity and profusion of statutes, regulations, and administrative machinery, and manifold cross-references to interrelated enactments and rules aggravate the problem of vagueness of wording.  P.   385 U.S. 604 . 4. The provisions of the Civil Service Law (§ 105, subd. 1(c)) and the Education Law (§ 3022, subd. 2) which make Communist Party membership, as such,  prima facie  evidence of disqualification   for employment in the public school system are ""overbroad,"" and therefore unconstitutional.  Pp.   385 U. S. 605 -610. (a) Constitutional doctrine after this Court's upholding of § 3022, subd. 2, in  Adler  has rejected its major premise that public employment may be conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights which could not be abridged by direct government action.  P.   385 U. S. 605 . (b) Mere knowing membership, without a specific intent to further the unlawful aims of an organization, is not a constitutionally adequate basis for imposing sanctions.  Pp.   385 U. S. 606 -610. 255 F. Supp. 981, reversed and remanded."

 FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   In No. 37, respondent brought a diversity libel action in federal court seeking compensatory and punitive damages for an article which was published in petitioner's magazine accusing respondent of conspiring to ""fix"" a football game between the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia, where he was privately employed as the athletic director.  The article was based upon an affidavit concerning a telephone conversation between respondent and the Alabama coach which the affiant, Burnett, had accidentally overheard.  Respondent challenged the truth of the article and claimed a serious departure by the magazine from good investigative standards of the accuracy of its charges amounting to reckless and wanton conduct.  He submitted evidence at the trial showing,  inter alia,  that petitioner's magazine, which had instituted a policy of ""sophisticated muckraking,"" knew that Burnett was on criminal probation but had published the story without any independent support for his affidavit; that it did not, before publication, view his notes (the information in which, if not valueless, would be readily available to any coach); that the magazine did not interview a person with Burnett when the phone call was overheard, view the game films, or check for any adjustments in Alabama's plans after the information was divulged, and that the magazine assigned the story to a writer not a football expert and made no effort to have such an expert check the story.  The jury was instructed on the issue of truth as a defense and was also instructed that it could award punitive damages and could assess the reliability and the nature of the sources of the magazine's information and its care in checking the assertions, considerations relevant tn determining whether the magazine had proceeded with ""wanton and reckless indifference.""  The jury returned a verdict of general and punitive damages which was reduced by remittitur.  The trial court rejected the defense's new trial motion based on  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254  (which was decided after the filing of the complaint in and trial of this case), holding that decision   inapplicable to one like petitioner not a public official.  It also held the evidence amply supported the conclusion that the magazine had acted in reckless disregard of whether the article was false or not.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the merits.  It did not reach the constitutional claim based on  New York Times,  holding that petitioner had waived the right to make that challenge, since some of its lawyers had been involved in the latter case, yet the defense was based solely on the issue of truth.  In No. 150, petitioner, a news association, published a dispatch about a massive riot on the University of Mississippi campus attending federal efforts to enforce a court decree ordering a Negro's enrollment.  The dispatch stated that respondent, a politically prominent figure whose statements on federal intervention had been widely publicized, had taken command of the violent crowd and led a charge against federal marshals trying to enforce the court's decree, had encouraged violence and given technical advice to the rioters.  Respondent brought a libel action in the Texas state courts for compensatory and punitive damages.  Petitioner's defense was based on truth and constitutional rights.  The evidence showed that the dispatch had been made on the scene and almost immediately reported to the petitioner by a competent correspondent.  There was no significant showing of improper preparation of the dispatch, or any prejudice by petitioner or its correspondent.  The jury was instructed that compensatory damages could be awarded if the dispatch was not substantially true and that punitive damages could be added if the article was actuated by ill will or entire want of care.  The jury returned a verdict for both compensatory and punitive damages.  The trial court refused to enter an award for the latter.  The court held  New York Times  inapplicable, but that, if applicable, it would require a verdict for the petitioner, since there was no evidence of malice.  Both sides appealed.

 Syllabus   On April 10, 1963, a temporary injunction was issued by an Alabama circuit court judge, pursuant to a bill of complaint filed by Birmingham officials, enjoining petitioners from participating in or encouraging mass street parades without a permit as required by city ordinance.  The bill and accompanying affidavits stated that demonstrations, parades, and picketing had been engaged in by petitioners for the preceding seven days, and were expected to continue.  Some of the petitioners, who had been served with copies of the writ the next morning, held a press conference and announced their intention to disobey the injunction.  No permit to parade was then or thereafter requested, but parades were held on April 12, Good Friday, and April 14, Easter Sunday.  At a contempt hearing, petitioners sought to attack the constitutionality of the injunction on the ground that it was vague, overbroad, and restrained free speech.  They also sought to attack the parade ordinance on a similar ground and on the basis that it had been administered in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner.  The circuit judge refused to consider these contentions, stating that there had been no motion to dissolve the injunction or any effort to comply with it by applying for a parade permit.  The court held that the only issues were whether it had jurisdiction to issue the injunction and whether petitioners had knowingly violated it.  Petitioners were found guilty, and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed. Held:   Petitioners could not bypass orderly judicial review of the temporary injunction before disobeying it.   Howat v. Kansas,   258 U. S. 181 .  Pp.   388 U. S. 314 -320. (a) The state court that issued the injunction had, as a court of equity, jurisdiction over petitioners and over the subject matter of the controversy.  P.   388 U. S. 315 . (b) The injunction was consistent with the strong interest of the city government in regulating the use of its streets and other public places.  Pp.   388 U. S. 315 -316. (c) While the generality of language in the parade ordinance would raise substantial constitutional issues, petitioners did not apply to the courts for an authoritative construction which might   have given the licensing authority granted in the ordinance a narrow and precise scope.  As in  Cox v. New Hampshire,   312 U. S. 569 , and  Poulos v. New Hampshire,   345 U. S. 395 , it cannot be assumed that the ordinance is void on its face.  Pp.   388 U. S. 316 -317. (d) The breadth and vagueness of the injunction itself would be subject to constitutional question, but the way to raise that question was to apply to the state courts to have the injunction modified or dissolved.  P.   388 U. S. 317 . (e) Even if the parade ordinance on which the injunction was based had been previously administered in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, it does not follow that the ordinance is void on its face.  Petitioners did not apply for a parade permit after issuance of the injunction, the claimed arbitrary refusal of which would have been considered by the state court upon a motion to dissolve the injunction.  Pp.   388 U. S. 317 -318. (f) The rule of law which the Alabama courts relied on was firmly established by precedents which put petitioners on notice that they could not bypass orderly judicial review of the injunction before disobeying it.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND
 Syllabus   Appellant, who had been offered a University of Maryland teaching position, brought this suit for declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of a state ""loyalty oath,"" which he refused to take.  The oath, drafted by the Attorney General and approved by the Board of Regents, contains a certification that an applicant for public employment is not ""engaged in one way or another in the attempt to overthrow the Government . . . by force or violence.""  Section 11 of the Ober Act authorizes state agencies to fix procedures to ascertain that a prospective employee is not a ""subversive person,"" a term which, as defined in §§ 1 and 13, reaches one who is a member of a subversive organization which would alter, overthrow, or destroy the Government by revolution, force, or violence.  A three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint. Held: 1. Since the authority to prescribe oaths is provided by § 11 of the Ober Act, which is tied to §§ 1 and 13, the oath here must be considered not in isolation, but with reference to §§ 1 and 13.  Pp.   389 U. S. 56 -57. 2. Sections 1 and 13 violate due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, since they are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad by not distinctly delineating between permissible and impermissible conduct in the sensitive and important area of academic freedom.   Pp.   389 U. S. 57 -62. (a) In  Gerende v. Election Board,   341 U. S. 56 , which involved application of an oath to candidates in Maryland for public office, this Court did not reach the question now presented.  P.   389 U. S. 58 . (b) In the light of the gloss placed upon the Act by the Maryland courts, it is uncertain whether only those members of a ""subversive"" group are barred who seek to overthrow or destroy the Government by force or violence.  Thus, a prospective employee could not know, save as he risked a perjury prosecution,   whether as a member of a group aiming through violence to overthrow the Government he would ""in one way or another"" be engaged in an attempt at violent overthrow even though he was ignorant of the group's real aims.  Pp.   389 U. S. 57 -62. 258 F. Supp. 589, reversed."

 Syllabus   The Illinois Bar Association and others brought this action to enjoin petitioner Union from the unauthorized practice of law.  The Union employs a licensed lawyer, solely compensated by an annual salary, to represent members and their dependents in connection with their claims under the Illinois Workmen's Compensation Act.  The trial court found that the Union's employment of the attorney constituted unauthorized practice of law, and enjoined the Union from ""[e]mploying attorneys on salary or retainer basis to represent its members with respect to Workmen's Compensation [or other statutory] claims."" The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contentions that the decree violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Held:   The trial court's decree preventing petitioner from hiring attorneys on a salary basis to assist its members in asserting their legal rights violates the freedom of speech, assembly, and petition provisions of the First Amendment as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   389 U. S. 221 -225. (a) No restraints by legislation or otherwise upon First Amendment rights can be sustained merely because they were imposed for the purpose of dealing with some evil within the State's competence.

 Syllabus   Appellant applied to the Commandant of the Coast Guard for validation of his merchant mariner's document evidencing his ability to act as a second assistant engineer.  Such validation is required by regulations promulgated pursuant to the Magnuson Act, which authorizes the President, if he finds that ""the security of the United States is endangered by . . . subversive activity,"" to issue regulations ""to safeguard . . . from sabotage or other subversive acts"" all ""vessels"" in the territories or waters under United States jurisdiction.  In response to a questionnaire, appellant stated that he had been a member of some organizations on the Attorney General's list of subversive organizations, but he refused to answer certain questions on a supplemental form relating generally to the nature and extent of his membership in any of the groups and to his political philosophy.  When the Commandant refused to process the application further, appellant brought this action seeking a declaration that the Act and the Commandant's actions thereunder were unconstitutional and praying that the Commandant be directed to approve the application.  A three-judge court dismissed the complaint. Held: 1. Since appellant challenged the Act's constitutionality on grounds of vagueness and abridgment of First Amendment rights and also questioned whether the power to install a screening program was properly delegated, the case was one to be heard by a three-judge court and this Court has jurisdiction of the appeal.  P.   390 U. S. 22 . 2. The Act gives the President no express authority to set up a screening program for personnel on American merchant vessels.  P.   390 U. S. 22 . 3. The procedure involved here, which is not concerned with appellant's conduct, but which arguably does impinge on his First Amendment freedoms, cannot be justified by the language of the Act, as the Act is to be read narrowly to avoid questions   concerning ""associational freedom"" and other rights within the protection of the First Amendment.

 FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI
 Syllabus   Appellants, to protest racial voting discrimination and encourage Negro registration, picketed the Forrest County, Mississippi, voting registration office in the county courthouse each weekday from January 23 to May 18, 1964, walking in a ""march route"" set off by the sheriff with barricades to facilitate access to the courthouse.  On April 8, the legislature enacted the Mississippi Anti-Picketing Law, which, as amended, prohibits ""picketing . . . in such a manner as to obstruct or unreasonably interfere with free ingress or egress to and from any county . . . courthouses. . . .""  On April 9, the sheriff read the new law to the pickets, ordered them to disperse, and removed the barricades.  When the pickets the next morning resumed marching along the now unmarked route, they were arrested for violating the Anti-Picketing statute.  Other arrests were made that, afternoon, on April 11, and on May 18.  On April 13, appellants brought this action seeking a judgment declaring that the Anti-Picketing Law is an invalid regulation of expression because of overbreadth and vagueness and an injunction against its enforcement in the prosecutions against them or otherwise, contending that the prosecutions were solely to discourage their freedom of expression.  Following initial dismissal of the complaint and this Court's remand (381 U.S. 741) for reconsideration in the light of the intervening decision in  Dombrowski v. Pfister,   380 U. S. 479 , an evidentiary hearing was held and the three-judge District Court again dismissed the complaint, holding that the statute was not void on its face and that appellants had failed to show sufficient irreparable injury to warrant injunctive relief. Held: 1. The Mississippi Anti-Picketing Law is a valid regulatory statute; it is clear and precise and is not overly broad, since it does not prohibit picketing unless it obstructs or unreasonably interferes with ingress and egress to or from the courthouse.  Pp.   390 U. S. 615 -417.  2. This Court's independent examination of the record does not disclose that the officials acted in bad faith to harass appellants' exercise of the right to free expression; that the statute was adopted to halt appellants' picketing; or that the State had no expectation of securing valid convictions.  This is therefore not a case where a federal equity court, ""by withdrawing the determination of guilt from state courts could rightly afford [appellants] any protection which they could not secure by prompt trial and appeal pursued to this Court."" Douglas v. City of Jeannette,   319 U. S. 157 ,   319 U. S. 164 .   Dombrowski, supra,  distinguished.  Pp.   390 U. S. 617 -622. 262 F. Supp. 873 , affirmed."

 OF NEW YORK, SECOND JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT
 Syllabus   Appellant, who operates a stationery store and luncheonette, was convicted of selling ""girlie"" magazines to a 16-year-old boy in violation of § 484-h of the New York Penal Law.  The statute makes it unlawful ""knowingly to sell . . . to a minor"" under 17 ""(a) any picture . . . which depicts nudity . . . and which is harmful to minors,"" and ""(b) any . . . magazine . . . which contains [such pictures] and which, taken as a whole, is harmful to minors.""  Appellant's conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court.  He was denied leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals. Held: 1. The magazines here involved are not obscene for adults, and appellant is not barred from selling them to persons 17 years of age or older.  Pp.   390 U. S. 634 -635. 2. Obscenity is not within the area of protected speech or press,  Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 ,   354 U. S. 485 , and there is no issue here of the obscenity of the material involved, as appellant does not argue that the magazines are not ""harmful to minors.""  P.   390 U. S. 635 . 3. It is not constitutionally impermissible for New York, under this statute, to accord minors under 17 years of age a more restricted right than that assured to adults to judge and determine for themselves what sex material they may read and see.  Pp.   390 U. S. 637 -643. (a) The State has power to adjust the definition of obscenity as applied to minors, for even where there is an invasion of protected freedoms, ""the power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults.""   Prince v. Massachusetts,   321 U. S. 158 ,   321 U. S. 170 .  Pp.   390 U.S. 638 -639. (b) Constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents' claim to authority in the rearing of their children is basic in our society, and the legislature could properly conclude that those primarily responsible for children's wellbeing are entitled to the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility.  P.   390 U. S. 639 .  (c) The State has an independent interest in protecting the welfare of children and safeguarding them from abuses.  Pp.   390 U. S. 640 -641. (d) This Court cannot say that the statute, in defining obscenity on the basis of its appeal to minors under 17, has no rational relation to the objective of safeguarding such minors from harm.  Pp.   390 U. S. 641 -643. 4. Subsections (f) and (g) of § 484-h are not void for vagueness. Pp. 643-645. (a) The New York Court of Appeals, in  Bookcase, Inc. v. Broderick,  18 N.Y.2d 71, 76, 218 N.E.2d 668, 671, construed the definition of obscenity ""harmful to minors"" in subsection (f) ""as virtually identical to"" this Court's most recent statement of the elements of obscenity in  Memoirs v. Massachusetts,   383 U. S. 413 ,   383 U. S. 418 , and accordingly the definition gives adequate notice of what is prohibited, and does not offend due process requirements.  P.   390 U. S. 643 . (b) Since the New York Legislature's attention was drawn to  People v. Finkelstein,  9 N.Y.2d 342, 174 N.E.2d 470, which defined the nature of  scienter  for New York's general obscenity statute, when it considered § 484-h, it may be inferred that the reference in provision (i) of subsection (g) to knowledge of the ""character and content"" of the material incorporates the gloss given the term ""character"" in  People v. Finkelstein.   P.   390 U. S. 644 . (c) Provision (ii) of subsection (g) states expressly that a defendant must be acquitted on the ground of ""honest mistake"" if he proves that he made ""a reasonable  bona fide  attempt to ascertain the true age of such minor.""  P.   390 U. S. 645 . Affirmed. "

In classifying a picture as ""not suitable for young persons,"" the Board must follow standards set forth in the ordinance and find that, in its judgment, the film describes or portrays (1) brutality, criminal violence, or depravity in such a manner as likely to incite young persons to crime or delinquency or (2) ""sexual promiscuity or extra-marital or abnormal sexual relations in such a manner as . . . likely to incite or encourage delinquency or sexual promiscuity on the part of young persons or to appeal to their prurient interest.""  A film shall be considered likely to produce such results if, in the Board's judgment, ""there is a substantial probability that it will create the impression on young persons that such conduct is profitable, desirable, acceptable, respectable, praiseworthy or commonly accepted."" If the exhibitor does not accept the Board's ""not suitable"" classification, the Board must file suit to enjoin the showing of the picture, and the Board's determination is subject to  de novo  review.  The ordinance is enforceable by a misdemeanor penalty, injunction, and license revocation.  Acting pursuant to the ordinance the Board, without giving reasons for its determination, classified as ""not suitable for young persons"" the film ""Viva Maria,"" for which appellants are respectively the exhibitor and distributor.  Following the exhibitor's notice of nonacceptance of the Board's classification, appellee petitioned for an injunction alleging in terms of the ordinance that the classification was warranted because of the film's portrayal of sexual promiscuity.  Two Board members testified at the hearing that several scenes portraying male-female relationships contravened ""acceptable and approved behavior.""  The trial judge, concluding that there were ""two or three features in the picture that look   to me would be unsuitable to young people,"" issued an injunction.  The appellate court, without limiting the standards of the ordinance, affirmed. Held:   The ordinance is violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments as being unconstitutionally vague, since it lacks ""narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards for the officials to follow,""  Niemotko v. Maryland,   340 U. S. 268 ,   340 U. S. 271  (1951).  Pp.   390 U. S. 682 -691. (a) Motion pictures are protected by the First Amendment, and cannot be regulated except by precise and definite standards.  Pp.   390 U. S. 682 -683. (b) The vice of vagueness is particularly pronounced where expression is subjected to licensing.  P.   390 U. S. 683 . (c) Vague censorship standards are not cured merely by  de novo  judicial review, and, unless narrowed by interpretation, only encourage erratic administration.  P.   390 U. S. 685 . (d) The term ""sexual promiscuity"" is not defined in the ordinance, and was not interpreted in the state courts.  The failure to limit that term or related terms used in the ordinance and the breadth of the standard ""profitable, desirable, acceptable, respectable, praiseworthy or commonly accepted"" give the censor a roving commission.  Pp.   390 U. S. 687 -688. (e) The evil of vagueness is not cured because the regulation of expression is one of classification, rather than direct suppression or was adopted for the salutary purpose of protecting children.  Pp.   390 U. S. 688 -689. 402 S.W.2d 770, reversed and remanded. "

 Syllabus   Petitioner made a televised political speech in the course of which he read questions which he had put to a union member, Albin, and Albin's answers; the answers falsely charged respondent, a public official, with criminal conduct.  Respondent sued petitioner for defamation, and was awarded damages by the trial judge.  The trial judge, having considered  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254  (1964), decided after the trial, denied a motion for a new trial.  An intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment, having found that petitioner had not acted with actual malice within the meaning of the  New York Times  rule,  i.e.,  with knowledge that petitioner's statements were false or with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not.  The State Supreme Court reversed, finding that there had been sufficient evidence that petitioner had acted in ""reckless disregard"" in that petitioner had no personal knowledge of respondent's activities; relied solely on Albin's affidavit though there was no evidence as to Albin's veracity; failed to verify the information with others who might know the facts; did not consider whether the statements were defamatory, and mistakenly believed that he had no responsibility for the broadcast because he was merely quoting Albin. Held:   In order that it can be found that a defendant, within the meaning of  New York Times,  acted in ""reckless disregard"" of whether a defamatory statement which he made about a public official is false or not, there must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant had serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.  Pp.   390 U. S. 730 -733. (a) In a defamation action by a public official, reckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published the statement or would have investigated before publishing.  P.   390 U. S. 731 . (b) The people's stake in the conduct of public officials is so great that neither the defense of truth nor the standard of ordinary care would adequately implement First Amendment policies.  Pp.   390 U. S. 731 -732. (c) A defendant's testimony that he acted in good faith is not conclusive as to that issue, since the factfinder, in the light of all   the surrounding circumstances. must determine whether the publication was indeed made in good faith.  P.   390 U. S. 732 . (d) The evidence in this case is not sufficient to permit the conclusion that petitioner acted in reckless disregard of whether the statements about respondent were false or not.  Pp.   390 U.

 Syllabus   Respondent Weis Markets owns and operates a supermarket in a large shopping center complex owned by respondent Logan Valley Plaza.  In front of Weis' building is a covered porch and a parcel pickup zone.  Members of petitioner union picketed Weis' store, confining the picketing almost entirely to the parcel pickup zone and the portion of the parking area adjacent thereto.  The picketing was peaceful, with some sporadic and infrequent congestion of the parcel pickup area.  A Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas enjoined ""picketing and trespassing upon . . . the [Weis] storeroom, porch and parcel pick-up area . . . [and] the [Logan] parking area,"" thus preventing picketing inside the shopping center.  That court held the injunction justified in order to protect respondents' property rights and because the picketing was unlawfully aimed at coercing Weis to compel its employees to join a union.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the issuance of the injunction on the sole ground that petitioners' conduct constituted a trespass on respondents' property. Held: 1. Peaceful picketing carried on in a location open generally to the public is, absent other factors involving the purpose or the manner of the picketing, protected by the First Amendment.  Pp.   391 U. S. 313 -315. 2. Although there may be regulation of the manner in which handbilling, or picketing, is carried out, that does not mean that either can be barred under all circumstances on publicly owned property simply by recourse to traditional concepts of property law concerning the incidents of ownership of real property.  Pp.   391 U. S. 315 -316. 3. Since the shopping center serves as the community business block ""and is freely accessible and open to the people in the area and those passing through,""  Marsh v. Alabama,   326 U. S. 501 ,   326 U. S. 508 , the State may not delegate the power, through the use of trespass laws, wholly to exclude those members of the public wishing to exercise their First Amendment rights on the premises in a manner   and for a purpose generally consonant with the use to which the property is actually put.  Pp.   391 U. S. 316 -325. 425 Pa. 382, 227 A.2d 874, reversed and remanded."

 FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   O'Brien burned his Selective Service registration certificate before a sizable crowd in order to influence others to adopt his anti-war beliefs.  He was indicted, tried, and convicted for violating 50 U.S.C.App. § 462(b), a part of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, subdivision (3) of which applies to any person ""who forges, alters,  knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates,  or in any manner changes any such certificate . . . ,"" the words italicized herein having been added by amendment in 1965.  The District Court rejected O'Brien's argument that the amendment was unconstitutional because it was enacted to abridge free speech and served no legitimate legislative purpose.  The Court of Appeals held the 1965 Amendment unconstitutional under the First Amendment as singling out for special treatment persons engaged in protests, on the ground that conduct under the 1965 Amendment was already punishable, since a Selective Service System regulation required registrants to keep their registration certificates in their ""personal possession at all times,"" 32 CFR § 1617.1, and willful violation of regulations promulgated under the Act was made criminal by 50 U.S.C.App. § 462(b)(6).  The court, however, upheld O'Brien's conviction under § 462(b)(6), which, in its view, made violation of the nonpossession regulation a lesser included offense of the crime defined by the 1965 Amendment. Held: 1. The 1965 Amendment to 50 U.S.C.App. § 462(b)(3) is constitutional as applied in this case.  Pp.   391 U. S. 375 ,   391 U. S. 376 -382. (a) The 1965 Amendment plainly does not abridge free speech on its face.  P.   391 U. S. 375 . (b) When ""speech"" and ""nonspeech"" elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms.  P.   391 U. S. 376 . (c) A governmental regulation is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the Government and furthers   an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedom is no greater than is essential to that interest.  The 1965 Amendment meets all these requirements.  P.   391 U. S. 377 . (d) The 1965 Amendment came within Congress'.""broad and sweeping"" power to raise and support armies and make all laws necessary to that end.  P.   391 U. S. 377 . (e) The registration certificate serves purposes in addition to initial notification,  e.g.,  it proves that the described individual has registered for the draft; facilitates communication between registrants and local boards, and provides a reminder that the registrant must notify his local board of changes in address or status.  The regulatory scheme involving the certificates includes clearly valid prohibitions against alteration, forgery, or similar deceptive misuse.  Pp.   391 U. S. 378 -380. (f) The preexistence of the nonpossession regulation does not negate Congress' clear interest in providing alternative statutory avenues of prosecution to assure its interest in preventing destruction of the Selective Service certificates.  P.   391 U. S. 380 . (g) The governmental interests protected by the 1965 Amendment and the nonpossession regulation, though overlapping, are not identical.  Pp.   391 U. S. 380 -381. (h) The 1965 Amendment is a narrow and precisely drawn provision which specifically protects the Government's substantial interest in an efficient and easily administered system for raising armies.  Pp.   391 U. S. 381 -382. (i) O'Brien was convicted only for the willful frustration of that governmental interest.  The noncommunicative impact of his conduct for which he was convicted makes his case readily distinguishable from  Stromberg v. California,   283 U. S. 359  (1931).  P.   391 U. S. 382 . 2. The 1965 Amendment is constitutional as enacted.  Pp.   391 U. S. 382 -385. (a) Congress' purpose in enacting the law affords no basis for declaring an otherwise constitutional statute invalid.   McCray v. United States,   195 U. S. 27  (1904).  Pp.   391 U. S. 383 -384. (b)  Grosjean v. American Press Co.,   297 U. S. 233  (1936) and  Gomillion v. Lightfoot,   364 U. S. 339  (1960), distinguished.  Pp.   391 U. S. 384 -385. 376 F.2d 538, vacated; judgment and sentence of District Court reinstated. "

 Syllabus   Appellee, Board of Education, dismissed appellant, a teacher, for writing and publishing in a newspaper a letter criticizing the Board's allocation of school funds between educational and athletic programs and the Board's and superintendent's methods of informing, or preventing the informing of, the school district's taxpayers of the real reasons why additional tax revenues were being sought for the schools.  At a hearing, the Board charged that numerous statements in the letter were false, and that the publication of the statements unjustifiably impugned the Board and school administration.  The Board found all the statements false as charged, and concluded that publication of the letter was ""detrimental to the efficient operation and administration of the schools of the district"" and that ""the interests of the school require[d] [appellant's dismissal]"" under the applicable statute.  There was no evidence at the hearing as to the effect of appellant's statements on the community or school administration.  The Illinois courts, reviewing the proceedings solely to determine whether the Board's findings were supported by substantial evidence and whether the Board could reasonably conclude that the publication was ""detrimental to the best interests of the schools,"" upheld the dismissal, rejecting appellant's claim that the letter was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, on the ground that, as a teacher, he had to refrain from making statements about the schools' operation ""which, in the absence of such position, he would have an undoubted right to engage in."" Held: 1. ""[T]he theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected."" Keyishian v. Board of Regents,   385 U. S. 589 ,   385 U. S. 605 -606 (1967).  The teacher's interest as a citizen in making public comment must be balanced against the State's interest in promoting the efficiency of its employees' public services.  P.   391 U. S. 568 . 2. Those statements of appellant's which were substantially correct regarded matters of public concern and presented no questions   of faculty discipline or harmony; hence those statements afforded no proper basis for the Board's action in dismissing appellant.  Pp.   391 U. S. 569 -570. 3. Appellant's statements which were false likewise concerned issues then currently the subject of public attention and were neither shown nor could be presumed to have interfered with appellant's performance of his teaching duties or the schools' general operation.  They were thus entitled to the same protection as if they had been made by a member of the general public, and, absent proof that those false statements were knowingly or recklessly made, did not justify the Board in dismissing appellant from public employment.

 Syllabus   Appellant Epperson, an Arkansas public school teacher, brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of Arkansas' ""anti-evolution"" statute.  That statute makes it unlawful for a teacher in any state supported school or university to teach or to use a textbook that teaches ""that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals.""  The State Chancery Court held the statute an abridgment of free speech violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The State Supreme Court, expressing no opinion as to whether the statute prohibits ""explanation"" of the theory or only teaching that the theory is true, reversed the Chancery Court.  In a two-sentence opinion, it sustained the statute as within the State's power to specify the public school curriculum. Held:   The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces the First Amendment's prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion.  Pp.   393 U. S. 102 -109. (a) The Court does not decide whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague, since, whether it is construed to prohibit explaining the Darwinian theory or teaching that it is true, the law conflicts with the Establishment Clause.  Pp.   393 U. S. 102 -103. (b) The sole reason for the Arkansas law is that a particular religious group considers the evolution theory to conflict with the account of the origin of man set forth in the Book of Genesis.  Pp.   393 U. S. 103 ,   393 U. S. 107 -109. (c) The First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.  Pp.   393 U. S. 103 -107. (d) A State's right to prescribe the public school curriculum does not include the right to prohibit teaching a scientific theory or doctrine for reasons that run counter to the principles of the First Amendment.

It was announced that the rally would be resumed the next night, August 7.

The order restrained petitioners for 10 days from holding rallies ""which will tend to disturb and endanger the citizens of the County,"" and the August 7 rally was not held.  After trial 10 days later, the Circuit Court issued another injunction, extending the effect of the earlier order for 10 months.  The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed the 10-day order, but reversed the 10-month order, holding that ""the period of time was unreasonable."" Held: 1. The case is not moot.  The Maryland Court of Appeals' approval of the 10-day order continues to play a role in the response of local officials to petitioners' efforts to continue their activities in the county.  Pp.   393 U. S. 178 -179. 2. The 10-day restraining order must be set aside because, where the principles guaranteed by the First Amendment and applicable to the States by the Fourteenth are involved, there is no place for such  ex parte  order, issued without formal or informal notice to petitioners, where no showing is made that it is impossible to serve or notify the opposing parties and to give them an opportunity to participate in an adversary proceeding.

Gabriel No. 572 Decided December 16, 1968 393 U.S. 256 APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   Appellee's draft Board rejected his claim to classification as a conscientious objector and classified him I-A.  His administrative appeals were unsuccessful and, after he was ordered to report for induction, he filed suit in the District Court to enjoin his induction and to have the rejection of his conscientious objector claim declared improper.  The District Court entered a preliminary injunction preventing induction until a determination of the claim on the merits.  That court held that § 10(b)(3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, which provides that there shall be no pre-induction judicial review ""of the classification or processing of any registrant,"" if applied to bar pre-induction review of appellee's classification, was unconstitutional. Held:   The draft Board had exercised its statutory discretion, evaluating the evidence in appellee's individual case, and had rejected his claim.  Congress may constitutionally require that a registrant's challenges to such decisions be deferred until after induction, when the remedy of habeas corpus would be available, or until defense of a criminal prosecution, should he refuse to submit to induction.   See Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd., ante,  p.   393 U. S. 233 . 287 F. Supp. 369 , reversed and remanded. PER CURIAM. Appellee's draft Board rejected his claim to classification as a conscientious objector and classified him I-A.  His appeals within the Selective Service System were unsuccessful.  After he was ordered to report for induction, he brought an action in the United States District   Court for the Northern District of California seeking to have his induction enjoined and to have the rejection of his claim to conscientious objector classification declared improper on the grounds that it had no basis in fact, that the Board had misapplied the statutory definition of conscientious objector, and that the members of the Board were improperly motivated by hostility and bias against those who claim to be conscientious objectors.  The District Court entered a preliminary injunction preventing appellee's induction until after a determination of his claim on the merits. In entering the preliminary injunction, the District Court held that it had jurisdiction to hear appellee's claim despite § 10(b)(3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C.App. § 460(b)(3) (1964 ed., Supp. III), which provides: ""No judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of any registrant by local boards, appeal boards, or the President, except as a defense to a criminal prosecution instituted under section 12 of this title, after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction, or for civilian work in the case of a registrant determined to be opposed to participation in war in any form:   Provided,  That such review shall go to the question of the jurisdiction herein reserved to local boards, appeal boards, and the President only when there is no basis in fact for the classification assigned to such registrant."" Acknowledging that this statute if applicable would prevent pre-induction review of appellee's classification, the District Court held that, so applied, § 10(b)(3) was unconstitutional because to provide for judicial consideration of the lawfulness of the Board's action only as a defense to a criminal prosecution would require that appellee pursue a ""tortuous judicial adventure"" so beset by ""hazards""   and ""penalties"" as to result ""in no review at all.""  The Government has appealed under 28 U.S.C. § 1252 which allows direct appeal to this Court of ""a interlocutory or final judgment, decree or order of any court of the United States . . . holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action . . . to which the United States . . . or any officer . . . thereof . . . is a party."" This Court has today, after full consideration, decided  Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd., ante,  p.   393 U. S. 233 .  Because the result here is dictated by the principles enunciated in that case, it is appropriate to decide this case summarily, reversing the District Court. In  Oestereich,  the delinquency procedure by which the registrant was reclassified was without statutory basis and in conflict with petitioner's rights explicitly established by the statute and not dependent upon an act of judgment by the Board.  Oestereich, as a divinity student, was by statute unconditionally entitled to exemption.  Here, by contrast, there is no doubt of the Board's statutory authority to take action which appellee challenges, and that action inescapably involves a determination of fact and an exercise of judgment.  By statute, classification as a conscientious objector is expressly conditioned on the registrant's claim being ""sustained by the local board.""  50 U.S.C.App.  456(j) (1964 ed., Supp. III). Here, the Board has exercised its statutory discretion to pass on a particular request for classification, ""evaluating evidence and . . . determining whether a claimed exemption is deserved.""   Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd., supra,  at   393 U. S. 238 .  A Local Board must make such a decision in respect of each of the many classification claims presented to it.  To allow pre-induction judicial review of such determinations would be to permit precisely the kind of ""litigious interruptions of procedures to provide necessary military manpower"" (113 Cong.Rec. 15426 (report by Senator Russell on Conference Committee action))   which Congress sought to prevent when it enacted § 10(b)(3). We find no constitutional objection to Congress' thus requiring that assertion of a conscientious objector's claims such as those advanced by appellee be deferred until after induction, if that is the course he chooses, whereupon habeas corpus would be an available remedy, or until defense of the criminal prosecution which would follow should he press his objections to his classification to the point of refusing to submit to induction.   Estep v. United States,   327 U. S. 114  (1946);  Falbo v. United States,   320 U. S. 549  (1944). The motion of appellee for leave to proceed  in forma pauperis  is granted.  The decision of the District Court is reversed, and the case remanded for issuance of an order dissolving the preliminary injunction and dismissing the action"

 Syllabus Petitioner, a Negro minister who helped lead 52 Negroes in an orderly civil rights march in Birmingham, Ala. in 1963, was arrested and convicted for violating § 1159 of the city's General Code, an ordinance which proscribes participating in any parade or procession on city streets or public ways without first obtaining a permit from the City Commission.  Section 1159 permits the Commission to refuse a parade permit if its members believe ""the public welfare, peace, safety, health, decency, good order, morals or convenience require that it be refused.""  Petitioner had previously been given to understand by a member of the Commission that under no circumstances would petitioner and his group be allowed to demonstrate in Birmingham.  The Alabama Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the grounds,  inter alia,  that § 1159, as written, unconstitutionally imposed an ""invidious prior restraint"" without ascertainable standards for the granting of permits, and that the ordinance had been discriminatorily enforced.  However, the Alabama Supreme Court in 1967 narrowly construed § 1159 as an objective, even-handed traffic regulation which did not allow the Commission unlimited discretion in granting or withholding permits, and upheld petitioner's conviction. Held: 1. A law subjecting the right of free expression in publicly owned places to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definite standards is unconstitutional, and a person faced with such a law may ignore it and exercise his First Amendment rights.  Pp.   394 U. S. 150 -151. 2. Picketing and parading may constitute methods of expression entitled to First Amendment protection, and use of the streets for that purpose, though subject to regulation, may not be wholly denied.  P.   394 U. S. 152 . 3. Since the terms of § 1159 gave the Commission unbridled authority to issue or withhold parade permits without reference to legitimate regulation of public streets and sidewalks, the ordinance would be, absent a limiting construction, unconstitutional on its face.  Pp.   394 U. S. 150 -151,   394 U. S. 153 .  4. The narrow construction that the State Supreme Court placed upon § 1159 in 1967 does not necessarily validate petitioner's 1963 conviction; the test is whether the ordinance was actually administered ""so as not to deny or unwarrantedly abridge the right of assembly and the opportunities for the communication of thought and the discussion of public questions immemorially associated with resort to public places.""  Cox v. New Hampshire,   312 U. S. 569 ,   312 U. S. 574 .  Pp.   394 U. S. 153 -155. 5. Since, in this case, § 1159 was administered in accordance with its impermissibly broad language, so as to ""deny or unwarrantedly abridge"" the First Amendment right of the petitioner and his organization, the petitioner's conviction may not stand.

 Syllabus   Under authority of a warrant to search appellant's home for evidence of his alleged bookmaking activities, officers found some films in his bedroom.  The films were projected and deemed to be obscene.  Appellant was arrested for their possession.  He was thereafter indicted, tried, and convicted for ""knowingly hav[ing] possession of . . . obscene matter"" in violation of a Georgia law.  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed, holding it ""not essential to an indictment charging one with possession of obscene matter that it be alleged that such possession was 'with intent to sell, expose or circulate the same.'"" Appellant contends that the Georgia obscenity statute is unconstitutional insofar as it punishes mere private possession of obscene matter.  Georgia, relying on  Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 , argues the statute's validity on the ground that ""obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.""   Id.  at   354 U. S. 485 . Held:   The First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth prohibits making mere private possession of obscene material a crime.  Pp.   394 U. S. 560 -568. (a) Neither  Roth, supra,  nor subsequent decisions of the Court were made in the context of a statute punishing mere private possession of obscene material, but involved governmental power to prohibit or regulate certain public actions respecting obscene matter.  Pp.   394 U. S. 560 -564.

 Syllabus   Appellant, having heard a news broadcast of the shooting of James Meredith, a civil rights leader, took an American flag which he owned to a street corner near his home in New York and ignited the flag.  He was arrested and thereafter charged by information with malicious mischief for violating § 1425, subd. 16, par. d, of the New York Penal Law, which makes it a crime publicly to mutilate or ""publicly [to] defy . . . or cast contempt upon [any American flag] either by words or act.""  The information charged appellant with burning the American flag and publicly speaking defiant or contemptuous words about the flag.  Appellant unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the information on the ground that the statute violated his constitutional right to free expression by punishing him for activity which he contended was a constitutionally protected ""demonstration"" or ""protest.""  Appellant was tried before a judge without a jury and convicted.  The arresting officer testified that, at the time of arrest, appellant was standing on a corner speaking to a small and not unruly group, which did not block the street or sidewalk; on the opposite corner was the burning flag; appellant told the group:  ""We don't need no damn flag,"" and said to the officer, ""If they let that happen to Meredith, we don't need an American flag.""  Appellant also challenged the constitutionality of the ""words"" part of the statute in the Appellate Term and in the New York Court of Appeals, both of which affirmed his conviction, the latter court upholding the constitutionality of the statute without alluding to the ""words"" part. Held: 1. Appellant has met the burden of showing that the federal question of constitutionality of the ""words"" part of the statute was adequately raised in the state courts, by appellant's motion to dismiss in the trial court and his briefs in the appellate courts.  Pp.   394 U. S. 581 -585. 2. The application of § 1425, subd. 16, par. d, to appellant was violative of rights of free expression assured against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment, because it permitted him to be punished merely for speaking defiant or contemptuous words about the American flag.  Pp.   394 U. S. 581 ,   394 U. S. 585 -594.  (a) Appellant's conviction must be set aside if it could have been based solely upon his words, or upon both his words and his act, and if a conviction on such a basis would be unconstitutional.   Stromberg v. California,   283 U. S. 359  (131);  Thomas v. Collins,   323 U. S. 516  (1945).  Pp.   394 U. S. 585 -588. (b) The record here is insufficient to eliminate the possibility that appellant's words were the sole basis of his conviction or that he was convicted for both his words and his deed.  Pp.   394 U. S. 588 -590. (c) Appellant's conviction under § 1425, subd. 16, par. d, for speaking she did could not be constitutionally justified on the basis that the words he uttered (1) constituted incitement to others to commit unlawful acts; (2) were so inflammatory as to provoke violent retaliation by others; (3) were (apart from the content of the ideas they conveyed) likely to shock passers-by; or (4), in the light of   Board of Educ. v. Barnette,   319 U. S. 624  (1943), constituted failure by the appellant to manifest the respect which every citizen must show the flag.  Pp.   394 U.

Decided April 21, 1969 394 U.S. 705 ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES
 COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner's remark during political debate at small public gathering that, if inducted into Army (which he vowed would never occur) and made to carry a rifle ""the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.,"" held to be crude political hyperbole which, in light of its context and conditional nature, did not constitute a knowing and willful threat against the President within the coverage of 18 U.S.C. § 871(a). Certiorari granted; 131 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 402 F.2d 676, reversed and remanded. PER CURIAM. After a jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, petitioner was convicted of violating a 1917 statute which prohibits any person from ""knowingly and willfully . . . [making] any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States. . . .""  *  The incident   which led to petitioner's arrest occurred on August 27, 1966, during a public rally on the Washington Monument grounds.  The crowd present broke up into small discussion groups and petitioner joined a gathering scheduled to discuss police brutality.  Most of those in the group were quite young, either in their teens or early twenties.  Petitioner, who himself was 18 years old, entered into the discussion after one member of the group suggested that the young people present should get more education before expressing their views.  According to an investigator for the Army Counter Intelligence Corps who was present, petitioner responded: ""They always holler at us to get an education.  And now I have already received my draft classification as 1-A and I have got to report for my physical this Monday coming.  I am not going.  If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J."" ""They are not going to make me kill my black brothers.""  On the basis of this statement, the jury found that petitioner had committed a felony by knowingly and willfully threatening the President.  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed by a two-to-one vote.  131 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 402 F.2d 676 (1968).  We reverse. At the close of the Government's case, petitioner's trial counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal.  He contended that there was ""absolutely no evidence on the basis of which the jury would be entitled to find that [petitioner] made a threat against the life of the President. "" He stressed the fact that petitioner's statement was made during a political debate, that it was expressly made conditional upon an event -- induction into the Armed Forces -- which petitioner vowed would never occur, and that both petitioner and the crowd laughed after the statement was made.  He concluded, ""Now actually what happened here in all this was a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President.  What he was saying, he says, I don't want to shoot black people because I don't consider them my enemy, and if they put a rifle in my hand it is the people that put the rifle in my hand, as symbolized by the President, who are my real enemy."" We hold that the trial judge erred in denying this motion. Certainly the statute under which petitioner was convicted is constitutional on its face.  The Nation undoubtedly has a valid, even an overwhelming, interest in protecting the safety of its Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without interference from threats of physical violence.   See  H.R.Rep. No. 652, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. (1916).  Nevertheless, a statute such as this one, which makes criminal a form of pure speech, must be interpreted with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind.  What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech. The judges in the Court of Appeals differed over whether or not the ""willfullness"" requirement of the statute implied that a defendant must have intended to carry out his ""threat.""  Some early cases found the willfulness requirement met if the speaker voluntarily uttered the charged words with ""an  apparent  determination to carry them into execution.""   Ragansky v. United States,  253 F. 643, 645 (C.A. 7th Cir.1918) (emphasis supplied);  cf. Piece v. United States,  365 F.2d 292 (C.A.   10th Cir.1966).  The majority below seemed to agree.  Perhaps this interpretation is correct, although we have grave doubts about it.    See  the dissenting opinion below, 131 U.S.App.D.C. at 135-142, 402 F.2d  at 686-693 (Wright, J.).  But whatever the ""willfullness"" requirement implies, the statute initially requires the Government to prove a true ""threat.""  We do not believe that the kind of political hyperbole indulged in by petitioner fits within that statutory term.  For we must interpret the language Congress chose ""against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."" New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 ,   376 U. S. 270  (1964).  The language of the political arena, like the language used in labor disputes,  see Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers of America,   383 U. S. 53 ,   383 U. S. 58  (1966), is often vituperative, abusive, and inexact.  We agree with petitioner that his only offense here was ""a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President.""  Taken in context, and regarding the expressly conditional nature of the statement and the reaction of the listeners, we do not see how it could be interpreted otherwise. The motion for leave to proceed  in forma pauperis  and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.  The case is remanded with instructions that it be returned to the District Court for entry of a judgment of acquittal. It is so ordered."

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has for many years imposed on broadcasters a ""fairness doctrine,"" requiring that public issues be presented by broadcasters and that each side of those issues be given fair coverage.  In No. 2, the FCC declared that petitioner Red Lion Broadcasting Co. had failed to meet its obligation under the fairness doctrine when it carried a program which constituted a personal attack on one Cook, and ordered it to send a transcript of the broadcast to Cook and provide reply time, whether or not Cook would pay for it.  The Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's position.  After the commencement of the  Red Lion  litigation, the FCC began a rulemaking proceeding to make the personal attack aspect of the fairness doctrine more precise and more readily enforceable, and to specify its rules relating to political editorials.  The rules, as adopted and amended, were held unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals in  RTNDA  (No. 717) as abridging the freedoms of speech and press. Held: 1. The history of the fairness doctrine and of related legislation shows that the FCC's action in the  Red Lion  case did not exceed its authority, and that, in adopting the new regulations, the FCC was implementing congressional policy.  Pp.   395 U. S. 375 -386. (a) The fairness doctrine began shortly after the Federal Radio Commission was established to allocate frequencies among competing applicants in the public interest, and insofar as there is an affirmative obligation of the broadcaster to see that both sides are presented, the personal attack doctrine and regulations do not differ from the fairness doctrine.  Pp.   395 U. S. 375 -379. (b) The FCC's statutory mandate to see that broadcasters operate in the public interest and Congress' reaffirmation, in the   1959 amendment to § 315 of the Communications Act, of the FCC's view that the fairness doctrine inhered in the public interest standard, support the conclusion that the doctrine and its component personal attack and political editorializing' regulations are a legitimate exercise of congressionally delegated authority.  Pp.   395 U. S. 379 -386. 2. The fairness doctrine and its specific manifestations in the personal attack and political editorial rules do not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.   395 U. S. 386 -401. (a) The First Amendment is relevant to public broadcasting, but it is the right of the viewing and listening public, and not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.  Pp.   395 U. S. 386 -390. (b) The First Amendment does not protect private censorship by broadcasters who are licensed by the Government to use a scarce resource which is denied to others.  Pp.   395 U. S. 390 -392. (c) The danger that licensees will eliminate coverage of controversial issues as a result of the personal attack and political editorial rules is, at best, speculative, and, in any event, the FCC has authority to guard against this danger.  Pp.   395 U. S. 392 -395. (d) There was nothing vague about the FCC's specific ruling in the  Red Lion  case, and the regulations at issue in No. 717 could be employed in precisely the same way as the fairness doctrine in  Red Lion.   It is not necessary to decide every aspect of the fairness doctrine to decide these cases.  Problems involving more extreme applications or more difficult constitutional questions will be dealt with if and when they arise.  Pp.   395 U. S. 395 -396. (e) It has not been shown that the scarcity of broadcast frequencies, which impelled governmental regulation, is entirely a thing of the past, as new uses for the frequency spectrum have kept pace with improved technology and more efficient utilization of that spectrum.  Pp.   395 U. S. 396 -400. No. 2, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 129, 381 F.2d 908, affirmed; No. 717, 400 F.2d 1002, reversed and remanded. "

Ohio No. 492 Argued February 27, 1969 Decided June 9, 1969 395 U.S. 444 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO
 Syllabus   Appellant, a Ku Klux Klan leader, was convicted under the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism statute for ""advocat[ing] . . . the duty, necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform"" and for ""voluntarily assembl[ing] with any society, group or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism."" Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions refined the statute's definition of the crime in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to imminent lawless action. Held:   Since the statute, by its words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action, it falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Freedoms of speech and press do not permit a State to forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.   Whitney v. California,   274 U. S. 357 , overruled. Reversed. PER CURIAM. The appellant, a leader of a Ku Klux Klan group, was convicted under the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism statute for ""advocat[ing] . . . the duty, necessity, or propriety   of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform"" and for ""voluntarily assembl[ing] with any society, group, or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism."" Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 2923.13.  He was fined $1,000 and sentenced to one to 10 years' imprisonment.  The appellant challenged the constitutionality of the criminal syndicalism statute under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, but the intermediate appellate court of Ohio affirmed his conviction without opinion.  The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed his appeal  sua sponte  ""for the reason that no substantial constitutional question exists herein.""  It did not file an opinion or explain its conclusions.  Appeal was taken to this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction.   393 U. S. 94  (196).  We reverse. The record shows that a man, identified at trial as the appellant, telephoned an announcer-reporter on the staff of a Cincinnati television station and invited him to come to a Ku Klux Klan ""rally"" to be held at a farm in Hamilton County.  With the cooperation of the organizers, the reporter and a cameraman attended the meeting and filmed the events.  Portions of the films were later broadcast on the local station and on a national network. The prosecution's case rested on the films and on testimony identifying the appellant as the person who communicated with the reporter and who spoke at the rally.  The State also introduced into evidence several articles appearing in the film, including a pistol, a rifle, a shotgun, ammunition, a Bible, and a red hood worn by the speaker in the films. One film showed 12 hooded figures, some of whom carried firearms.  They were gathered around a large wooden cross, which they burned.  No one was present   other than the participants and the newsmen who made the film.  Most of the words uttered during the scene were incomprehensible when the film was projected, but scattered phrases could be understood that were derogatory of Negroes and, in one instance, of Jews. [ Footnote 1 ]  Another scene on the same film showed the appellant, in Klan regalia, making a speech.  The speech, in full, was as follows: ""This is an organizers' meeting.  We have had quite a few members here today which are -- we have hundreds, hundreds of members throughout the State of Ohio.  I can quote from a newspaper clipping from the Columbus, Ohio, Dispatch, five weeks ago Sunday morning.  The Klan has more members in the State of Ohio than does any other organization.  We're not a revengent organization, but if our President, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race, it's possible that there might have to be some revengeance taken."" ""We are marching on Congress July the Fourth, four hundred thousand strong.  From there, we are dividing into two groups, one group to march on St. Augustine, Florida, the other group to march into Mississippi.  Thank you.  "" The second film showed six hooded figures one of whom, later identified as the appellant, repeated a speech very similar to that recorded on the first film.  The reference to the possibility of ""revengeance"" was omitted, and one sentence was added:  ""Personally, I believe the nigger should be returned to Africa, the Jew returned to Israel.""  Though some of the figures in the films carried weapons, the speaker did not. The Ohio Criminal Syndicalism Statute was enacted in 1919.  From 1917 to 1920, identical or quite similar laws were adopted by 20 States and two territories.  E. Dowell, A History of Criminal Syndicalism Legislation in the United States 21 (1939).  In 1927, this Court sustained the constitutionality of California's Criminal Syndicalism Act, Cal.Penal Code §§ 11400-11402, the text of which is quite similar to that of the laws of Ohio.   Whitney v. California,   274 U. S. 357  (1927).  The Court upheld the statute on the ground that, without more, ""advocating"" violent means to effect political and economic change involves such danger to the security of the State that the State may outlaw it.   Cf. Fiske v. Kansas,   274 U. S. 380  (1927).  But  Whitney  has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions.   See Dennis v. United States,   341 U. S. 494 , at   341 U. S. 507  (1951).  These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. [ Footnote 2 ]  As we   said in  Noto v. United States,   367 U. S. 290 ,   367 U. S. 297 -298 (1961), ""the mere abstract teaching . . . of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action."" See also Herndon v. Lowry,   301 U. S. 242 ,   301 U. S. 259 -261 (1937);  Bond v. Floyd,   385 U. S. 116 ,   385 U. S. 134  (1966).  A statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  It sweeps within its condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from governmental control.   Cf. Yates v. United States,   354 U. S. 298  (1957);  De Jonge v. Oregon,   299 U. S. 353  (1937);  Stromberg v. California,   283 U. S. 359  (1931).   See also United States v. Robel,   389 U. S. 258  (1967);  Keyishian v. Board of Regents,   385 U. S. 589  (1967);  Elfbrandt v. Russell,   384 U. S. 11  (1966);  Aptheker v. Secretary of State,   378 U. S. 500  (1964);  Baggett v. Bullitt,   377 U. S. 360  (1964). Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act cannot be sustained.  The Act punishes persons who ""advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety"" of violence ""as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform""; or who publish or circulate or display any book or paper containing such advocacy; or who ""justify"" the commission of violent acts ""with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of the doctrines of criminal syndicalism""; or who ""voluntarily assemble"" with a group formed ""to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism.""  Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions to the jury in any way refined the statute's bald definition of the crime   in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to imminent lawless action. [ Footnote 3 ] Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute which, by its own words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action. [ Footnote 4 ]  Such a statute falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The contrary teaching of  Whitney v. California, supra,  cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled. Reversed. [ Footnote 1 ] The significant portions that could be understood were: ""How far is the nigger going to -- yeah."" ""This is what we are going to do to the niggers."" ""A dirty nigger."" ""Send the Jews back to Israel."" ""Let's give them back to the dark garden."" ""Save America."" ""Let's go back to constitutional betterment."" ""Bury the niggers."" ""We intend to do our part."" ""Give us our state rights."" ""Freedom for the whites."" ""Nigger will have to fight for every inch he gets from now on."" [ Footnote 2 ] It was on the theory that the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 670, 18 U.S.C. § 35, embodied such a principle and that it had been applied only in conformity with it that this Court sustained the Act's constitutionality.   Dennis v. United States,   341 U. S. 494  (1951).  That this was the basis for  Dennis  was emphasized in  Yates v. United States,   354 U. S. 298 ,   354 U. S. 320 -324 (1957), in which the Court overturned convictions for advocacy of the forcible overthrow of the Government under the Smith Act, because the trial judge's instructions had allowed conviction for mere advocacy, unrelated to its tendency to produce forcible action. [ Footnote 3 ] The first count of the indictment charged that appellant ""did unlawfully by word of mouth advocate the necessity, or propriety of crime, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing political reform. . . ."" The second count charged that appellant ""did unlawfully voluntarily assemble with a group or assemblage of persons formed to advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism. . . .""  The trial judge's charge merely followed the language of the indictment.  No construction of the statute by the Ohio courts has brought it within constitutionally permissible limits.  The Ohio Supreme Court has considered the statute in only one previous case,  State v. Kassay,  126 Ohio St. 177, 184 N.E. 521 (1932), where the constitutionality of the statute was sustained. [ Footnote 4 ] Statutes affecting the right of assembly, like those touching on freedom of speech, must observe the established distinctions between mere advocacy and incitement to imminent lawless action, for, as Chief Justice Hughes wrote in  De Jonge v. Oregon, supra,  at   299 U. S. 364 :  ""The right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech and free press, and is equally fundamental.""   See also United States v. Cruikshank,   92 U. S. 542 ,   92 U. S. 552  (1876);  Hague v. CIO,   307 U. S. 496 ,   307 U. S. 513 ,   307 U. S. 519  (1939);  NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,   357 U. S. 449 ,   357 U.

 Syllabus   Petitioner challenges his 1955 conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 for falsely and fraudulently denying affiliation with the Communist Party in an affidavit he filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), pursuant to § 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act.  Section 9(h), later repealed, provided that a union could not draw upon the jurisdiction of the NLRB unless each union officer filed with the NLRB an affidavit stating ""that he is not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such party. . . .""  The District Court set aside the conviction.  It distinguished  Dennis v. United States,   384 U. S. 855 ; decided that § 9(h), which had been upheld in  American Communications Assn. v. Douds,   339 U. S. 382 , could no longer be thought constitutionally valid, particularly in light of  United States v. Brown,   381 U. S. 437 , and concluded that the Government had no right to ask the questions which petitioner answered falsely in his affidavit.  The Court of Appeals reversed, since it found ""no significant differences"" between this case and  Dennis, supra,  and therefore thought it unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of § 9(h). Held: 1. The constitutionality of § 9(h) is legally irrelevant to the validity of petitioner's conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, which punishes the making of fraudulent statements to the Government,  Dennis, supra,  because none of the elements of proof for petitioner's conviction under § 1001 has been shown to depend on the validity of § 9(h).  Pp.   396 U. S. 68 -72. (a) The statutory term ""affiliated,"" which petitioner claims is vague and overbroad and which he suggests he misunderstood, was narrowly defined by the trial court in an instruction later explicitly approved by this Court, and the jury's verdict reflects a determination that petitioner's false statement was knowingly and deliberately made.  Pp.   396 U. S. 69 -70. (b) Petitioner's false statement was made in a ""matter within the jurisdiction"" of the NLRB, as the NLRB received the affidavit pursuant to explicit statutory authority, which, only a short time before, had been upheld as constitutional in  Douds, supra.   Pp.   396 U. S. 70 -71.  2.  Dennis, supra,  negates any general principle that a citizen has a privilege to answer fraudulently a question that the Government should not have asked.  P.   396 U. S. 72 . 3. This case is not distinguishable from  Dennis, supra,  which is followed here.  Pp.   396 U. S. 72 -73. 403 F.2d 340, affirmed."

 FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Writ of certiorari to determine if indefinite suspension from university where petitioner was a student violated his First Amendment rights held improvidently granted, since (as developed after the writ was granted) the suspension as partly based on a finding that he lied at the hearing on the charges against him. 407 F.2d 834, certiorari dismissed. PER CURIAM. Petitioner Jones was suspended indefinitely as a student at Tennessee A. & I. State University in the summer of 1967.  His indefinite suspension was confirmed after a hearing in September of that year, in which charges against him were specified, evidence taken, and findings made.  He, along with two other suspended students, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, seeking to set aside the suspension on First Amendment and due process grounds.  After a hearing, the District Court granted judgment on the merits to defendants with an opinion.  279 F.Supp.   190 (1968).  On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  407 F.2d 834 (1969).  We granted certiorari, 396 U.S. 817 (1969), primarily to consider the issues raised by Jones' claim that he had been separated from the university solely because of his distribution of leaflets urging a boycott of fall registration. After oral argument, and on closer review of the record, it emerges -- as it did not from the certiorari papers or the opinions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals -- that Jones' indefinite suspension was based in part on a finding that he lied at the hearing on the charges against him.  This fact sufficiently clouds the record to render the case an inappropriate vehicle for this Court's first decision on the extent of First Amendment restrictions upon the power of state universities to expel or indefinitely suspend students for the expression of views alleged to be disruptive of the good order of the campus.  Accordingly, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted. It is so ordered."

 Syllabus   Appellant property owner unsuccessfully sought an injunction in the New York courts to prevent the New York City Tax Commission from granting property tax exemptions to religious organizations for properties used solely for religious worship, as authorized by the state constitution and the implementing statute providing for tax exemptions for property used exclusively for religious, educational, or charitable purposes.  Appellant contended that the exemptions, as applied to religious bodies, violated provisions prohibiting establishment of religion under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Held: 1. The First Amendment tolerates neither governmentally established religion nor governmental interference with religion.  Pp.   397 U. S. 667 -672. 2. The legislative purpose of tax exemptions is not aimed at establishing, sponsoring, or supporting religion, and New York's legislation simply spares the exercise of religion from the burden of property taxation levied on private profit institutions.  Pp.   397 U. S. 672 -674. 3. The tax exemption creates only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, far less than taxation of churches would entail, and it restricts the fiscal relationship between them, thus tending to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating each from the other.  Pp.   397 U. S. 674 -676. 4. Freedom from taxation for two centuries has not led to an established church or religion, and, on the contrary, has helped to guarantee the free exercise of all forms of religious belief.  Pp.   397 U. S. 676 -680. 24 N.Y.2d 30, 246 N.E.2d 517, affirmed. "

 FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   Appellants, who are in the mail-order business, brought suit to enjoin the operation of 39 U.S.C. § 4009, challenging its constitutionality.  That section provides that a person who has received by mail ""a pandering advertisement which offers for sale matter which the addressee in his sole discretion believes to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative,"" may request the Postmaster General to issue an order ""directing the sender and his agents or assigns to refrain from further mailings to the named addressee.""  Such order would also require the sender to delete the addressee's name from his mailing lists, and would prohibit him from trading in lists from which the deletion has not been made.  If the Postmaster General believes that his order has been violated, he may notify the sender of his belief and the reasons therefor, and must grant him an opportunity to respond and to have an administrative hearing on whether a violation has occurred.  If the Postmaster General thereafter determines that the order has been violated, he may request the Attorney General to seek an order from a district court directing compliance with the prohibitory order.  A three-judge court found that § 4009 was constitutional when interpreted to prohibit advertisements similar to those initially mailed to the addressee. Held: 1. The statute allows the addressee unreviewable discretion to decide whether he wishes to receive any further material from a particular sender.  Pp.   397 U. S. 731 -735. 2. A vendor does not have a constitutional right to send unwanted material into someone's home, and a mailer's right to communicate must stop at the mailbox of an unreceptive addressee.  Pp.   397 U. S. 735 -738. 3. The statute comports with the Due Process Clause, as it provides for an administrative hearing if the sender violates the Postmaster General's prohibitory order, and a judicial hearing prior to issuance of any compliance order by a district court.  Pp.   397 U. S. 738 -739.  4. The statute doe not violate due process by requiring that the sender remove the complaining addressee' name from his mailing lists, nor is the statute unconstitutionally vague, as the sender knows precisely what he must do when he receives  a prohibitory order.  P.   397 U. S. 740 . 300 F. Supp. 1036 , affirmed."

 Syllabus   At public meetings before the Greenbelt, Maryland, City Council, the efforts of respondent, a prominent real estate developer and state legislator, to secure zoning variances for certain land he owned while the city was trying to acquire other land of his on which to build a school were vigorously discussed.  In publishing in their newspaper full accounts of the meetings, petitioners reported that various citizens had characterized respondent's negotiating position as ""blackmail.""  Respondent, concededly a ""public figure,"" brought this libel action against petitioners for publishing the reports notwithstanding their knowledge that he had not committed the crime of blackmail.  The trial judge instructed the jury that respondent could recover if petitioners' publications had been made with malice (defined as including ""spite, hostility, or deliberate intention to harm"") or reckless disregard of whether they were true or false, and that malice could be found from the ""language"" of the publication itself.  The jury found for respondent, and the judgment was affirmed on appeal. Held: 1. The trial court's instructions, which permitted the jury to find liability merely on the basis of the reported hostile remarks made during a debate on a public issue, violated the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, whether respondent is considered to be a ""public official"" or a ""public figure.""   New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 ;  Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts,   388 U. S. 130 .  Pp.   398 U. S. 8 -11. 2. In the circumstances of this case, where it is undisputed that petitioners' reports of the meetings were accurate, the word ""blackmail"" was not slanderous when spoken, or libelous when reported by petitioners, as there is no evidence whatsoever that the word was used to impute a crime to respondent or was intended as more than a vigorous epithet.  Pp.   398 U. S. 11 -14. 253 Md. 324, 252 A.2d 755, reversed and remanded. "

 Syllabus   Petitioner, who participated in a skit performed several times in front of an Armed Forces induction center demonstrating opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam conflict, was convicted by a jury of violating 18 U.S.C. § 702, which makes criminal the unauthorized wearing of an American military uniform or part thereof.  Petitioner alleged that he was authorized to wear the uniform by 10 U.S.C. § 772(f), which permits wearing of a uniform while one is portraying a member of an armed force in a theatrical or motion picture production ""if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force.""  His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and he filed a petition for certiorari after the time specified in Supreme Court Rule 22(2) had expired. Held: 1. The street skit in which petitioner participated was a ""theatrical production"" within the meaning of § 772(f).  Pp.   398 U. S. 61 -62. 2. The words ""if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force"" in § 772(f) impose an unconstitutional restraint on freedom of speech, and must be stricken from the section to preserve its constitutionality.  Pp.   398 U. S. 62 -63. 3. The time requirement of Rule 22(2) is not jurisdictional and may be waived by the Court. Pp. 63-65. 414 F.2d 630, reversed. "

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner was convicted of refusing to submit to induction into the Armed Forces despite his claim for conscientious objector status under § 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act.  That provision exempts from military service persons who by reason of ""religious training and belief"" are conscientiously opposed to war in any form, that term being defined in the Act as ""belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation"" but not including ""essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal code.""  In his exemption application, petitioner stated that he could not affirm or deny belief in a ""Supreme Being,"" and struck the words ""my religious training and"" from the form.  He affirmed that he held deep conscientious scruples against participating in wars where people were killed.  The Court of Appeals, while noting that petitioner's ""beliefs are held with the strength of more traditional religious convictions,"" concluded that those beliefs were not sufficiently ""religious"" to meet the terms of § 6(j), and affirmed the conviction.  Petitioner contends that the Act violates the First Amendment prohibition of establishment of religion, and that his conviction should be set aside on the basis of  United States v. Seeger,   380 U. S. 163 , which held that the test of religious belief under § 6(j) is whether it is a sincere and meaningful belief occupying in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualified for the exemption. Held:   The judgment is reversed.  Pp.   398 U. S. 335 -367. 404 F.2d 1078, reversed."

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS
 Syllabus   Appellee was indicted for willfully failing to report for induction as ordered by his local draft board.  He moved to dismiss the indictment because (1) the involvement in Vietnam violated international law, (2) he ""reasonably believed the government's involvement in Vietnam to be illegal,"" (3) the Selective Service Act and its regulations were unconstitutional, as the local boards' procedures lacked due process, and (4) compulsory conscription in peacetime was unnecessary, and stifled fundamental liberties.  The District Judge dismissed the motion, and the case proceeded to trial.  The instructions to the jury made no reference to a conscientious objector claim, or to whether the appellee was ""sincere"" in his beliefs, but advised the jury that the crux of the case was whether appellee's refusal was ""unlawful, knowingly, and willfully"" done.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty.  Thereafter, appellee made a motion under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 34 to arrest the judgment on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction.  The District Court, in granting what it termed a motion in arrest of judgment, ruled not on the jurisdictional contention, but on appellee's ""older contention"" that the indictment could not charge an offense based on the Establishment, Free Exercise, and Due Process Clause arguments relating to conscientious objections to the Vietnam conflict.  The court stated the facts of the case and described how appellee's demeanor on the stand convinced the judge of his sincerity.  The court held that the Free Exercise and Due Process Clauses prohibited application of the Draft Act to appellee to require him to fight in Vietnam because, as a ""sincerely conscientious man,"" his interest in not killing in Vietnam outweighed ""the country's present need for him to be so employed.""  The court also ruled that § 6(j) of the Selective Service Act violates the Establishment Clause.  The Government bases its claim that this Court has jurisdiction to review the case on the ""arresting judgment"" provision of 18 U.S.C. § 3731, which provides that an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court from a decision (1) arresting a judgment of conviction, (2) for insufficiency of the indictment or information, (3) where such decision   is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information is founded. Held: 1. The decision below was not one ""arresting a judgment of conviction.""  Pp.   399 U. S. 280 -287. (a) In granting a motion in arrest of judgment under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 34, which preserves the common law requirement, a district court must not look beyond the face of the record, and thus a decision based on evidence adduced at trial cannot be one arresting judgment.  Pp.   399 U. S. 280 -282. (b) The District Court clearly went beyond the ""face of the record"" in reaching its decision, as the court's factual findings concerning appellee's sincerity and opposition to fighting in Vietnam are essential to its disposition of the case.  Pp.   399 U. S. 283 -284. (c) Even assuming,  arguendo,  that the parties could secure review under the ""motion in arrest"" provisions of § 3731 on the basis of a stipulation, there certainly was no formal stipulation here, and the most that can be said is that, after the lower court's decision, the Government chose to accept the opinion's findings of fact.  Pp.   399 U. S. 284 -287. 2. The indictment here was not insufficient, as it recited the necessary elements of an offense, and did not allege facts that themselves demonstrate the availability of a constitutional privilege.  Pp.   399 U. S. 287 -288. 3. Since the disposition below was based on factual conclusions not found in the indictment, but resulting from evidence adduced at trial, the decision was, in fact, an acquittal rendered after the jury's verdict of guilty, and not, as characterized by the trial judge, an arrest of judgment.  Pp.   399 U. S. 288 -290. 4. The legislative history of the Criminal Appeals Act, rather than manifesting a broad congressional directive to this Court to review important legal issues, shows a legislative policy to provide review in only certain cases and to restrict it to those instances.  A primary concern of the Act is that no appeal be taken by the Government from an acquittal, no matter how erroneous the underlying legal theory.  Pp.   399 U. S. 291 -299. 5. This Court does not have jurisdiction in this case under the ""motion in bar"" provision of § 3731.  Pp.   399 U. S. 299 -307. (a) A motion in bar cannot be granted on the basis of facts that would necessarily be tried with the general issue in the case, and, here, the District Judge based his findings on evidence presented in the trial of the general issue.  Pp.   399 U. S. 301 -302.  (b) An appeal from a motion in bar cannot be granted after jeopardy attaches, and, in light of the compromise origins of the Criminal Appeals Act, the concern of some Senators over retrial of a defendant whose trial ended after the jury was impaneled, and the long-time consistent interpretation by the Government, jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn.  Pp.   399 U. S. 302 -307. 297 F. Supp. 902 , dismissed."

 FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   Title 39 U.S.C. § 4006 permits the Postmaster General to stamp as ""Unlawful"" and return to the sender letters addressed to any person and to prohibit the payment of postal money orders to that person if he finds, on ""evidence satisfactory to [him],"" that the person is obtaining or seeking money through the mails for ""an obscene . . . matter"" or is using the mails to distribute information about how such items may be obtained.  Under departmental regulations, following complaint and notice of hearing, a Judicial Officer holds a hearing and renders his opinion ""with all due speed,"" from which there is an administrative appeal.  Section 4007 permits district courts to order the defendant's incoming mail detained pending completion of the § 4006 proceedings, upon a showing of ""probable cause"" to believe that § 4006 is being violated, under the standards fixed by Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 65.  In No. 55, appellee, a retail magazine distributor against whom the Postmaster General had instituted a § 4006 proceeding, brought an action in the District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. A three-judge court held the statute unconstitutional for failure to meet the requirements of  Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51 , which held with respect to a scheme of administrative censorship that (1) the censor must initiate judicial review and prove that the material is unprotected expression; (2) ""prompt judicial review"" is mandatory; and (3) any restraint before a final judicial determination must be limited to the shortest, fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution.  In No. 58, where the Postmaster General applied for a § 4007 order, the District Court, on appellee distributor's counterclaim, held § 4006 unconstitutional under  Freedman v. Maryland, supra,  and that § 4007's ""probable cause"" standard was constitutionally insufficient to support a temporary mail detention order. Held:   The administrative censorship scheme created by 39 U.S.C. §§ 4006, 4007   violates the First Amendment since it lacks adequate safeguards against undue inhibition of protected expression.   Freedman v. Maryland, supra.   Pp.   400 U. S. 416 -422. (a) The statutory scheme does not require governmentally initiated judicial participation in the procedure barring the magazines from the mails or assuring prompt judicial review.  Pp. 417-418. (b) The authority given the Postmaster General under § 4007 to apply for a court order for temporary mail detention does not cure the defects in § 4006, since the procedure is only discretionary and the requirement for prompt judicial review is not satisfied by a ""probable cause"" finding.  Pp.   400 U. S. 419 -420. (c) Section 4007 fails to provide that any restraint preceding a final judicial determination ""be limited to preservation of the  status quo  for the shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution.""  380 U.S. at   380 U.

Wadmond No. 49 Argued October 15, 1970 Decided February 23, 1971 401 U.S. 154 APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
 FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 Syllabus   Appellants challenge, primarily on First Amendment vagueness and overbreadth grounds, the system for screening applicants for admission to the New York Bar.  To carry out the statutory requirement that the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ""be satisfied that such person possesses the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor at law,"" Committees on Character and Fitness receive affidavits from two persons (one of whom must be a practicing attorney) acquainted with the applicant, and a questionnaire completed by the applicant.  The Committees also conduct personal interviews with each applicant.  As the final step before admission to the Bar, the applicant must take an oath that he will support the United States and New York Constitutions.  Appellants attack the procedure not because any applicant has ever been unjustifiably denied permission to practice law in New York, but on the basis that it works a ""chilling effect"" upon the exercise of free speech and association of law students.  The three-judge District Court found certain items on the questionnaire so vague, overbroad, and intrusive on applicants' privacy as to be of doubtful constitutional validity, but upheld the statute and rules as valid on their face, and with the exceptions noted, sustained the validity of the procedure. Held:                                     I 1. The ""character and general fitness"" requirement for admission to the New York Bar is not violative of the Constitution.  Pp.   401 U. S. 159 -160. (a) The requirement has been construed by appellees to encompass no more than ""dishonorable conduct relevant to the legal profession.""  P.   401 U. S. 159 . (b) The current third-party affidavits, setting forth the nature and extent of affiants' acquaintance with the applicant, do not infringe upon the applicant's right to privacy.  P.   401 U. S. 160 .  2. New York's Rule that an applicant furnish proof that he ""believes in the form of government of the United States and is loyal to such government,"" is not constitutionally invalid in light of appellees' construction that the Rule places no burden of proof on the applicant, that the ""form of government"" and the ""government"" refer solely to the Constitution, and that ""belief"" and ""loyalty"" mean no more than willingness to take the constitutional oath and ability to do so in good faith.  Pp.   401 U. S. 161 -164. 3. The challenged items on the modified questionnaire are not constitutionally invalid, as one is precisely tailored to conform to this Court's decisions on organizational membership and association, and the other is merely supportive of appellees' task of ascertaining the applicant's good faith in taking the constitutional oath.  Pp.   401 U. S. 164 -166. 4. New York's carefully administered screening system does not necessarily result in chilling the exercise of constitutional freedoms, and whether a different policy might be wiser rests with that State's policymaking bodies.

 Syllabus   Just before the 1960 New Hampshire Democratic primary election, petitioner newspaper published a column characterizing senatorial candidate Roy as a ""former small-time bootlegger.""  Roy, who was not elected, sued the newspaper and the distributor of the column for libel.  The judge told the jury that Roy, as a candidate, was a ""public official,"" and that a rule requiring a showing that the article was false and had been published ""with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or true,"" applied as long as the libel concerned ""official,"" as opposed to ""private,"" conduct.  The jury was instructed that, if it found the libel to be in the ""public sector,"" it had to bring in a verdict for the distributor, as there was no evidence that it had engaged in knowing or reckless falsehood, but that it had to decide on the ""preponderance of the evidence"" whether the newspaper was liable.  If the publication was in the ""private sector,"" there were two defenses:  (1) ""justification,"" if the article was true and published on a ""lawful occasion,"" and (2) ""conditional privilege,"" if the article was false, but if the publication was ""on a lawful occasion, in good faith, for a justifiable purpose, and with a belief founded on reasonable grounds of the truth of the matter published."" The jury returned a verdict against both the newspaper and the distributor of the column.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the jury properly considered whether the alleged libel was ""relevant"" to Roy's fitness for office. Held: 1. Publications concerning candidates for public office must be accorded at least as much protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments as those concerning occupants of public office.  Pp.   401 U. S. 270 -272. 2. As a matter of constitutional law, a charge of criminal conduct, no matter how remote in time or place, can never be irrelevant to an official's or a candidate's fitness for purposes of applying the ""knowing falsehood or reckless disregard"" rule of  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 .  Pp.   401 U. S. 272 -277.  3. The jury here was erroneously permitted to determine that the criminal charge was not ""relevant"" and that the  New York Times  standard was inapplicable.  P.   401 U.

Pape No. 109 Argued December 16, 1970 Decided February 24, 1971 401 U.S. 279 CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   In a discussion of ""police brutality and related private violence"" in its 1961 Report, the Civil Rights Commission mentioned the case of  Monroe v. Pape,   365 U. S. 167 , and listed some of the allegations of Monroe's civil rights complaint filed against certain Chicago policemen headed by Deputy Chief of Detectives Pape.  In an article about the Report, Time magazine quoted from a summary of the complaint, without indicating that the charges were Monroe's, and not the independent findings of the Commission.  Pape sued the petitioner publisher for libel.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's grant of Time's motion for summary judgment, holding that there had to be a trial on the question of whether Time's failure to make clear that it was reporting no more than allegations showed ""actual malice"" (knowledge that the information was false or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not) under the rule of  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 .  At the trial, the author of the article and the researcher admitted awareness that the wording of the Report had been significantly altered, but insisted that its real meaning had not been changed.  The District Court granted Time's motion for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the jury should determine whether the omission of the word ""alleged"" showed ""actual malice.""  Both courts agreed that Pape was a ""public official,"" and that the article concerned his ""official conduct."" Held:   In the circumstances of this case, the magazine did not engage in a ""falsification"" sufficient, in itself, to sustain a jury finding of ""actual malice.""  Pp.   401 U. S. 284 -292. (a) The magazine's omission of the word ""alleged"" amounted to the adoption of one of several rational interpretations of a document bristling with ambiguities, and while that choice might reflect a misconception, it was not enough to create a jury issue of ""malice"" under the rule of  New York Times, supra,  as it would impose a stricter standard of liability on errors of interpretation or judgment than on errors of historic fact.  P.   401 U. S. 290 .  (b) This holding is confined to the specific facts of this case, and nothing herein is to be understood as making the word ""alleged"" a superfluity in published reports of information damaging to reputation.  P.   401 U. S. 292 . 419 F.2d 980, reversed and remanded. STEWART, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.

 FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner in No. 85, who was convicted for failure to report for induction, and petitioner in No. 325, who sought discharge from the armed forces upon receipt of orders for Vietnam duty, claim exemption from military service because of their conscientious objection to participation in the Vietnam conflict, as an ""unjust"" war, pursuant to § 6(j) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967.  That section provides that no person shall be subject to ""service in the armed forces of the United States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form."" Petitioners also challenge the constitutionality of § 6(j) as construed to cover only objectors to all war, as violative of the Free Exercise and Establishment of Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. Held: 1. The exemption for those who oppose ""participation in war in any form"" applies to those who oppose participating in all war and not to those who object to participation in a particular war only, even if the latter objection is religious in character.  Pp.   401 U. S. 441 -448. 2. Section 6(j) does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Pp.   401 U. S. 448 -460. (a) The section on its face does not discriminate on the basis of religious affiliation or belief, and petitioners have not shown the absence of neutral, secular bases for the exemption.  Pp.   401 U. S. 450 -453. (b) The exemption provision focuses on individual conscientious belief and not on sectarian affiliations.  P.   401 U. S. 454 . (c) There are valid neutral reasons, with the central emphasis on the maintenance of fairness in the administration of military conscription, for the congressional limitation of the exemption to ""war in any form,"" and therefore § 6(j) cannot be said to reflect a religious preference.  Pp.   401 U. S. 454 -460.  3. Section 6(j) does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  It is not designed to interfere with any religious practice and does not penalize any theological position.  Any incidental burdens felt by petitioners are justified by the substantial governmental interests relating to military conscription.  Pp.   401 U. S. 461 -462. No. 85, 420 F.2d 298, and No. 325, 418 F.2d 908, affirmed. MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and HARLAN, BRENNAN, STEWART, WHITE, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.

 Syllabus   Appellee, who had advertised in the newspaper the sale to persons over 21 years of age of a booklet entitled The True Facts About Imported Pornography, was indicted for mailing copies of the booklet in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1461, which prohibits the knowing use of the mails for the delivery of obscene matter.  Appellee moved to dismiss the indictment, contending that the statute was unconstitutional.  Assuming,  arguendo,  that the booklets were obscene, the trial judge granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that appellee made a constitutionally protected delivery and that § 1461 was unconstitutional as applied to him.

 FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   Customs agents seized as obscene photographs possessed by claimant Luros when he returned to this country from Europe on October 24, 1969.  Section 1305(a) of 19 U.S.C. pursuant to which the agents acted, prohibits the importation of obscene material, provides for its seizure at any customs office and retention pending the judgment of the district court, and specifies that the collector of customs give information of the seizure to the district attorney, who shall institute forfeiture proceedings.  The agents referred the matter to the United States Attorney, who brought forfeiture proceedings on November 6.  Luros' answer denied that the photographs were obscene and counterclaimed that § 1305(a) was unconstitutional.  He asked for a three-judge court, which, on November 20, was ordered to be convened.  Following a hearing on January 9, 1970, the court on January 27 held § 1305(a) unconstitutional on the grounds that the statute (1) failed to meet the procedural requirements of  Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51 , and (2) was overly broad as including within its ban obscene material for private use, making it invalid under  Stanley v. Georgia,   394 U. S. 557 .

Following petitioner's acquittal of criminal obscenity charges, he filed this diversity action in District Court seeking damages under Pennsylvania's libel law.  The jury found for petitioner and awarded $25,000 in general damages; and $725,000 in punitive damages, which was reduced by the court on remittitur to $250,000.

Washington No. 71-247 Argued February 29, 1972 Decided March 20, 1972 405 U.S. 313 CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON
 Syllabus   Petitioner was convicted of violating Washington's obscenity statute for showing a sexually frank motion picture at a drive-in theater.  In affirming his conviction, the Washington Supreme Court did not hold that the film was obscene under the standards of  Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 , and  Memoirs v. Massachusetts,   383 U. S. 413 , but that it was obscene in ""the  context  of its exhibition"" at a drive-in.  The statute proscribing the knowing display of ""obscene"" films did not mention the location of the exhibition as an element of the offense. Held:   A State may not criminally punish the exhibition of a motion picture film at a drive-in theater where the statute assertedly violated has not given fair notice that the location of the exhibition was a vital element of the offense. 79 Wash. 2d 254 ,  484 P.2d 917 , reversed. PER CURIAM. Petitioner was the manager of the Park Y Drive-In Theatre in Richland, Washington, where the motion picture Carmen Baby was shown.  The motion picture is a loose adaptation of Bizet's opera Carmen, containing   sexually frank scenes, but no instances of sexual consummation are explicitly portrayed.  After viewing the film from outside the theater fence on two successive evenings, a police officer obtained a warrant and arrested petitioner for violating Washington's obscenity statute.  Wash.Rev.Code § 9.68.010.  Petitioner was later convicted and, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Washington affirmed.   79 Wash. 2d 254 ,  484 P.2d 917  (1971).  We granted certiorari.  404 U.S. 909.  We reverse petitioner's conviction. The statute under which petitioner was convicted, Wash.Rev.Code § 9.68.010, made criminal the knowing display of ""obscene"" motion pictures: ""Every person who -- "" ""(1) Having knowledge of the contents thereof shall exhibit, sell, distribute, display for sale or distribution, or having knowledge of the contents thereof shall have in his possession with the intent to sell or distribute any book, magazine, pamphlet, comic book, newspaper, writing, photograph, motion picture film, phonograph record, tape or wire recording, picture, drawing, figure, image, or any object or thing which is obscene; or"" ""(2) Having knowledge of the contents thereof shall cause to be performed or exhibited, or shall engage in the performance or exhibition of any show, act, play, dance or motion picture which is obscene;"" ""Shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor."" In affirming petitioner's conviction, however, the Supreme Court of Washington did not hold that Carmen Baby was obscene under the test laid down by this Court's prior decisions.   E.g., Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 ;  Memoirs v. Massachusetts,   383 U. S. 413 .  Uncertain ""whether the movie was offensive to the standards relating to sexual matters in that area and whether   the movie advocated ideas or was of artistic or literary value,"" the court concluded that, if it ""were to apply the strict rules of  Roth,  the film 'Carmen Baby' probably would pass the definitional obscenity test if the viewing audience consisted only of consenting adults."" 79 Wash. 2d  at 263, 484 P.2d  at 922.  Respondent read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Washington more narrowly, but nonetheless implied that, because the film had ""redeeming social value,"" it was not, by itself, ""obscene"" under the  Roth  standard.  The Supreme Court of Washington nonetheless upheld the conviction, reasoning that in ""the  context  of its exhibition,"" Carmen Baby was obscene. Ibid. To avoid the constitutional vice of vagueness, it is necessary, at a minimum, that a statute give fair notice that certain conduct is proscribed.  The statute under which petitioner was prosecuted, however, made no mention that the ""context"" or location of the exhibition was an element of the offense somehow modifying the word ""obscene.""  Petitioner's conviction was thus affirmed under a statute with a meaning quite different from the one he was charged with violating. ""It is as much a violation of due process to send an accused to prison following conviction of a charge on which he was never tried as it would be to convict him upon a charge that was never made."" Cole v. Arkansas,   333 U. S. 196 ,   333 U. S. 201 .  Petitioner's conviction cannot, therefore, be allowed to stand.   Gregory v. City of Chicago,   394 U. S. 111 ;  Garner v. Louisiana,   368 U. S. 157 ;  Cole v. Arkansas, supra. Under the interpretation given § 9.68.010 by the Supreme Court of Washington, petitioner is criminally punished for showing Carmen Baby in a drive-in, but he may exhibit it to adults in an indoor theater with impunity.  The statute, so construed, is impermissibly vague as applied to petitioner because of its failure to   give him fair notice that criminal liability is dependent upon the place where the film is shown. What we said last Term in  Cohen v. California,   403 U. S. 15 ,   403 U. S. 19 , answers respondent's contention that the peculiar interest in prohibiting out-door displays of sexually frank motion pictures justifies the application of this statute to petitioner: ""Any attempt to support this conviction on the ground that the statute seeks to preserve an appropriately decorous atmosphere in the courthouse where Cohen was arrested must fail in the absence of any language in the statute that would have put appellant on notice that certain kinds of otherwise permissible speech or conduct would nevertheless, under California law, not be tolerated in certain places. . . .  No fair reading of the phrase 'offensive conduct' can be said sufficiently to inform the ordinary person that distinctions between certain locations are thereby created."" We need not decide the broad constitutional questions tendered to us by the parties.  We hold simply that a State may not criminally punish the exhibition at a drive-in theater of a motion picture where the statute used to support the conviction has not given fair notice that the location of the exhibition was a vital element of the offense. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is Reversed."

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS
 Syllabus   Appellee's employment at the Boston State Hospital was terminated when she refused to take the following oath required of all public employees in Massachusetts: ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and that I will oppose the overthrow of the government of the United States of America or of this Commonwealth by force, violence, or by any illegal or unconstitutional method."" Appellee challenged the constitutionality of the oath statute.  A three-judge District Court concluded that the attack on the ""uphold and defend"" clause was foreclosed by  Knight v. Board of Regents,   390 U. S. 36 , but found the ""oppose the overthrow"" clause ""fatally vague and unspecific,"" and thus violative of the First Amendment.  In response to a remand from this Court, the District Court concluded that the case was not moot, and reinstated its earlier judgment. Held:   The Massachusetts oath is constitutionally permissible.  Pp.   405 U. S. 679 -687. (a) The oath provisions of the United States Constitution, Art. II, § 1, cl. 8, and Art. VI, cl. 3, are not inconsistent with the First Amendment.  Pp.   405 U. S. 681 -682. (b) The District Court properly held that the ""uphold and defend"" clause, a paraphrase of the constitutional oath, is permissible.  P.   405 U. S. 683 . (c) The ""oppose the overthrow"" clause was not designed to require specific action to be taken in some hypothetical or actual situation, but was to assure that those in positions of public trust were willing to commit themselves to live by the constitutional processes of our government.  Pp.   405 U. S. 683 -685. (d) The oath is not void for vagueness.  Perjury, the sole punishment, requires a knowing and willful falsehood, which removes the danger of punishment without fair notice, and there is no problem of punishment inflicted by mere prosecution, as there has been no prosecution under the statute since its enactment, nor has any been planned.  Pp.   405 U. S. 685 -686.  (e) There is no constitutionally protected right to overthrow a government by force, violence, or illegal or unconstitutional means, and therefore there is no requirement that one who refuse to take Massachuetts' oath be granted a hearing for the determination of some other fact before being dicharged.

 Syllabus   Respondents, members of the Old Order Amish religion and the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, were convicted of violating Wisconsin's compulsory school attendance law (which requires a child's school attendance until age 16) by declining to send their children to public or private school after they had graduated from the eighth grade.  The evidence showed that the Amish provide continuing informal vocational education to their children designed to prepare them for life in the rural Amish community.  The evidence also showed that respondents sincerely believed that high school attendance was contrary to the Amish religion and way of life, and that they would endanger their own salvation and that of their children by complying with the law.  The State Supreme Court sustained respondents' claim that application of the compulsory school attendance law to them violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Held: 1. The State's interest in universal education is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on other fundamental rights, such as those specifically protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children.  Pp.   406 U. S. 213 -215. 2. Respondents have amply supported their claim that enforcement of the compulsory formal education requirement after the eighth grade would gravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of their religious beliefs.  Pp.   406 U.S. 215 -219 3. Aided by a history of three centuries as an identifiable religious sect and a long history as a successful and self-sufficient segment of American society, the Amish have demonstrated the sincerity of their religious beliefs, the interrelationship of belief with their mode of life, the vital role that belief and daily conduct play in the continuing survival of Old Order Amish communities, and the hazards presented by the State's enforcement of a statute generally valid as to others.  Beyond this, they have   carried the difficult burden of demonstrating the adequacy of their alternative mode of continuing informal vocational education in terms of the overall interest that the State relies on in support of its program of compulsory high school education.  In light of this showing, and weighing the minimal difference between what the State would require and what the Amish already accept, it was incumbent on the State to show with more particularity how its admittedly strong interest in compulsory education would be adversely affected by granting an exemption to the Amish.

The State's claim that it is empowered, as  parens patriae,  to extend the benefit of secondary education to children regardless of the wishes of their parents cannot be sustained against a free exercise claim of the nature revealed by this record, for the Amish have introduced convincing evidence that accommodating their religious objections by forgoing one or two additional years of compulsory education will not impair the physical or mental health of the child, or result in an inability to be self-supporting or to discharge the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, or in any other way materially detract from the welfare of society.

 FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO
 Syllabus   Appellant political party, its officers, and members, attacked the constitutionality of revisions of the Ohio election code made following this Court's decision in  Socialist Labor Party v. Rhodes,   393 U. S. 23 , and a provision that a political party execute a loyalty affidavit under oath in order to obtain a ballot position.  The District Court, deciding the case on cross-motions for summary judgment on the basis of the pleadings and supporting affidavits, upheld all appellants' challenges except that involving the oath provision.  All parties appealed.  A revision of the election code made after this Court noted probable jurisdiction mooted all but the oath issue.  Appellants, who did not attack the oath provision in  Rhodes  and who have been on the ballot and presumably have complied with that provision since its adoption in 1941, contend that it violates the First Amendment, is impermissibly vague, does not comport with due process, and, since it applies to them and not the two major political parties, violates equal protection. Held:   The record and pleadings on the one issue not mooted by the supervening legislation (an issue that received scant attention in appellants' complaint, and none in the affidavits supporting the cross-motions for summary judgment) are inadequate for resolution of the constitutional questions presented, and, in view of the abstract and speculative posture of the case, the appeal must therefore be dismissed.

 Syllabus   Appellant, arrested for disorderly conduct when he failed, notwithstanding several requests by an officer, to leave a congested roadside where a friend in another car was being ticketed for a traffic offense, was tried and convicted in an inferior court and fined $10.  Kentucky has a two-tier system for adjudicating certain criminal cases, under which a person charged with a misdemeanor may be tried first in an inferior court and, if dissatisfied with the outcome, may have a trial  de novo  in a court of general criminal jurisdiction, but must risk a greater punishment if convicted.  Exercising his right to a trial  de novo,  appellant was tried for disorderly conduct in the circuit court, convicted, and fined $50.  The state appellate court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that the disorderly conduct statute is unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and that the greater punishment contravened the due process requirements of  North Carolina v. Pearce,   395 U. S. 711 , and violated the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause.  The disorderly conduct statute makes it an offense for a person with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, to congregate with others in a public place and refuse to comply with a lawful police dispersal order.  As construed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, a violation occurs only where there is no  bona fide  intention to exercise a constitutional right or where the interest to be advanced by the individual's exercise of the right is insignificant in comparison to the inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm caused by his action. Held: 1. The disorderly conduct statute was not unconstitutionally applied, there having been ample evidence that the action of appellant, who had no constitutional right to observe the ticketing process or engage the issuing officer in conversation, was interfering with enforcement of traffic laws.  Pp.   407 U. S. 108 -110. 2. The statute is not impermissibly vague or broad, as ""citizens who desire to obey [it] will have no difficulty in understanding it,"" and, as construed by the Kentucky court, individuals may not be convicted thereunder merely for expressing unpopular ideas.  Pp.   407 U. S. 110 -111.  3. Kentucky's two-tier system does not violate the Due Process Clause, as it imposes no penalty on those who seek a trial  de novo  after having been convicted in the inferior court.  The Kentucky procedure involves a completely fresh determination of guilt or innocence by the superior court which is not the court that acted on the case before and has no motive to deal more strictly with a  de novo  defendant than it would with any other.   North Carolina v. Pearce, supra,  distinguished.  Pp.   407 U. S. 112 -119. 4. The Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit an enhanced sentence on reconviction.   North Carolina v. Pearce, supra,  at   395 U. S. 719 -720.  Pp.   407 U. S. 119 -120. 467 S.W.2d 374 , affirmed.

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondents sought to distribute handbills in the interior mall area of petitioner's large privately owned shopping center.  Petitioner had a strict no-handbilling rule.  Petitioner's security guards requested respondents under threat of arrest to stop the handbilling, suggesting that they could resume their activities on the public streets and sidewalks adjacent to but outside the center, which respondents did.  Respondents, claiming that petitioner's action violated their First Amendment rights, thereafter brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief.  The District Court, stressing that the center is ""open to the general public"" and ""the functional equivalent of a public business district,"" and relying on  Marsh v. Alabama,   326 U. S. 501 , and  Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza,   391 U. S. 308 , held that petitioner's policy of prohibiting handbilling within the mall violated respondents' First Amendment rights.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   There has been no dedication of petitioner's privately owned and operated shopping center to public use so as to entitle respondents to exercise First Amendment rights therein that are unrelated to the center's operations, and petitioner's property did not lose its private character and its right to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the public is generally invited to use it for the purpose of doing business with petitioner's tenants.  The facts in this case are significantly different from those in  Marsh, supra,  which involved a company town with ""all the attributes"" of a municipality, and  Logan Valley, supra,  which involved labor picketing designed to convey a message to patrons of a particular store, so located in the center of a large private enclave as to preclude other reasonable access to store patrons.  Under the circumstances present in this case, where the handbilling was unrelated to any activity within the center and where respondents had adequate alternative means of communication, the courts below erred in holding those decisions controlling.

 Syllabus   Prior to its being called upon in 1967 to assist local authorities in quelling civil disorders in Detroit, Michigan, the Department of the Army had developed only a general contingency plan in connection with its limited domestic mission under 10 U.S.C. § 331.  In response to the Army's experience in the various civil disorders it was called upon to help control during 1967 and 1968, Army Intelligence established a data-gathering system, which respondents describe as involving the ""surveillance of lawful civilian political activity."" Held:   Respondents' claim that their First Amendment rights are chilled due to the mere existence of this data-gathering system does not constitute a justiciable controversy on the basis of the record in this case, disclosing as it does no showing of objective harm or threat of specific future harm.

 FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioners, seeking to form a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) at a state-supported college, were denied recognition as a campus organization.  Recognition would have entitled petitioners to use campus facilities for meetings and to use of the campus bulletin board and school newspaper.  The college president denied recognition because he was not satisfied that petitioners' group was independent of the National SDS, which he concluded has a philosophy of disruption and violence in conflict with the college's declaration of student rights.  Petitioners thereupon brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court first ordered a further administrative hearing, after which the president reaffirmed his prior decision.  Approving the president's judgment, the District Court held that petitioners had failed to show that they could function free from the National SDS and that the college's refusal to approve the group, which the court found ""likely to cause violent acts of disruption,"" did not violate petitioners' associational rights.  The Court of Appeals, purporting not to reach the First Amendment issues, affirmed on the ground that petitioners had failed to avail themselves of the due process accorded to them and to meet their burden of complying with the prevailing standards for recognition. Held: 1. The courts erred in (1) discounting the cognizable First Amendment associational interest that petitioners had in furthering their personal beliefs and (2) assuming that the burden was on petitioners to show entitlement to recognition by the college, rather than on the college to justify its nonrecognition of the group, once petitioners had made application conformably to college requirements.  Pp.   408 U. S. 180 -185. 2. Insofar as the denial of recognition to petitioners' group was based on an assumed relationship with the National SDS, or was a result of disagreement with the group's philosophy, or was a consequence of a fear of disruption, for which there was no support in the record, the college's decision violated the petitioners' First Amendment rights.  A proper basis for nonrecognition might have   been afforded, however, by a showing that the group refused to comply with a rule requiring them to abide by reasonable campus regulations.  Since the record is not clear whether the college ha such a rule, and, if so, whether petitioners intend to observe it, these issues remain to be resolved.  Pp.   408 U. S. 185 -194. 45 F.2d 1122, reversed and remanded. POWELL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and DOUGLAS, BRENNAN, STEWART, WHITE, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.

 Syllabus   Petitioner was convicted under an obscenity statute for publishing in his underground newspaper pictures of nudes and a sex poem.  The State Supreme Court upheld the conviction as not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. Held:   In the context in which they appeared, the photographs were rationally related to a news article, in conjunction with which they appeared, and were entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.  In view of the poem's content and placement with other poems inside the newspaper, its dominant theme cannot be said to appeal to prurient interest.   Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 . Certiorari granted; 51 Wis.2d 668,  188 N.W.2d 467 , reversed. PER CURIAM. Petitioner was convicted in the state trial court of violating a Wisconsin statute prohibiting the dissemination of ""lewd, obscene or indecent written matter, picture, sound recording, or film.""  Wis.Stat. § 944.21(1)(a) (1969).  He was sentenced to consecutive one-year terms in the Green Bay Reformatory and fined $1,000 on each of two counts.  The Supreme Court of Wisconsin upheld his conviction against the contention that he had been deprived of freedom of the press in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  51 Wis.2d 668,  188 N.W.2d 467 .  Petitioner was the publisher of an underground newspaper called Kaleidoscope.  In an issue published in May, 1968, that newspaper carried a story entitled ""The One Hundred Thousand Dollar Photos"" on an interior page.  The story itself was an account of the arrest of one of Kaleidoscope's photographers on a charge of possession   of obscene material.  Two relatively small pictures, showing a nude man and nude woman embracing in a sitting position, accompanied the article and were described in the article as ""similar"" to those seized from the photographer.  The article said that the photographer, while waiting in the district attorney's office, had heard that bail might be set at $100,000.  The article went on to say that bail had, in fact, been set originally at $100, then raised to $250, and that, later, the photographer had been released on his own recognizance.  The article purported to detail police tactics that were described as an effort to ""harass"" Kaleidoscope and its staff.   Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476  (1957), held that obscenity was not protected under the First or Fourteenth Amendments.  Material may be considered obscene when, ""to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest."" 354 U.S. at   354 U. S. 489 .  In enunciating this test, the Court in  Roth  quoted from  Thornhill v. Alabama,   310 U. S. 88 ,   310 U. S. 101 -102: ""The freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment.  The exigencies of the colonial period and the efforts to secure freedom from oppressive administration developed a broadened conception of these liberties as adequate to supply the public need for  information and education with respect to the significant issues of the times.  . . ."" (Emphasis supplied.) We do not think it can fairly be said, either considering the article as it appears or the record before the state   court, that the article was a mere vehicle for the publication of the pictures.  A quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book will not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene publication, but if these pictures were indeed similar to the one seized -- and we do not understand the State to contend differently -- they are relevant to the theme of the article.  We find it unnecessary to consider whether the State could constitutionally prohibit the dissemination of the pictures by themselves, because, in the context in which they appeared in the newspaper, they were rationally related to an article that itself was clearly entitled to the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.   Thornhill v. Alabama, supra.   The motion for leave to proceed  in forma pauperis  and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted.  The conviction on count one must therefore be reversed. In its August, 1968, issue, Kaleidoscope published a two-page spread consisting of 11 poems, one of which was entitled ""Sex Poem.""  The second count of petitioner's conviction was for the dissemination of the newspaper containing this poem.  The poem is an undisguisedly frank, play-by-play account of the author's recollection of sexual intercourse.  But, as the  Roth  Court emphasized, ""sex and obscenity are not synonymous. . . .  The portrayal of sex,  e.g.,  in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself sufficient reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press."" 354 U.S. at   354 U. S. 487 .  A reviewing court must, of necessity, look at the context of the material, as well as its content. In this case, considering the poem's content and its placement amid a selection of poems in the interior of a newspaper, we believe that it bears some of the earmarks of an attempt at serious art.  While such earmarks are not inevitably a guarantee against a finding of obscenity, and while, in this case, many would conclude   that the author's reach exceeded his grasp, this element must be considered in assessing whether or not the ""dominant"" theme of the material appeals to. prurient interest.  While ""contemporary community standards,""  Roth v. United States,  354 U.S. at   354 U. S. 489 , must leave room for some latitude of judgment, and while there is an undeniably subjective element in the test as a whole, the ""dominance"" of the theme is a question of constitutional fact.  Giving due weight and respect to the conclusions of the trial court and to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, we do not believe that it can be said that the dominant theme of this poem appeals to prurient interest.  The judgment on the second count, therefore, must also be reversed. Reversed."

 FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A United States Senator read to a subcommittee from classified documents (the Pentagon Papers), which he then placed in the public record.  The press reported that the Senator had arranged for private publication of the Papers.  A grand jury investigating whether violations of federal law were implicated subpoenaed an aide to the Senator.  The Senator, as an intervenor, moved to quash the subpoena, contending that it would violate the Speech or Debate Clause to compel the aide to testify.  The District Court denied the motion, but limited the questioning of the aide.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial, but modified the protective order, ruling that congressional aides and other persons may not be questioned regarding legislative acts, and that, though the private publication was not constitutionally protected, a common law privilege similar to the privilege of protecting executive officials from liability for libel,  see Barr v. Matteo,   360 U. S. 564 , barred questioning the aide concerning such publication. Held: 1. The Speech or Debate Clause applies not only to a Member of Congress but also to his aide, insofar as the aide's conduct would be a protected legislative act if performed by the Member himself.   Kilbourn v. Thompson,   103 U. S. 168 ;  Dombrowski v. Eastland,   387 U. S. 82 ; and  Powell v. McCormack,   395 U. S. 486 , distinguished.  Pp.   408 U. S. 613 -622. 2. The Speech or Debate Clause does not extend immunity to the Senator's aide from testifying before the grand jury about the alleged arrangement for private publication of the Pentagon Papers, as such publication had no connection with the legislative process.  Pp.   408 U. S. 622 -627. 3. The aide, similarly, had no nonconstitutional testimonial privilege from being questioned by the grand jury in connection with its inquiry into whether private publication of the Papers violated federal law.  P.   408 U. S. 627 .  4. The Court of Appeals' protective order was overly broad in enjoining interrogation of the aide with respect to any act, ""in the broadest sense,"" that he performed within the cope of his employment, since the aide's immunity extended only to legislative acts as to which the Senator would be immune.  And the aide may be questioned by the grand jury about the source of classified documents in the Senator's possession, as long as the questioning implicates no legislative act.  The order in other respects would suffice if it forbade questioning the aide or others about the conduct or motives of the Senator or his aides at the subcommittee meeting; communications between the Senator and his aides relating to that meeting or any legislative act of the Senator; or steps of the Senator or his aides preparatory for the meeting, if not relevant to third-party crimes.  Pp.   408 U. S. 627 -629. 455 F.2d 753, vacated and remanded. WHITE, J., wrote the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and BLACKMUN, POWELL, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.  STEWART, J., filed an opinion dissenting in part,  post,  p.   408 U. S. 629 .  DOUGLAS, J., filed a dissenting opinion,  post,  p.   408 U. S. 633 .  BRENNAN, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which DOUGLAS and MARSHALL, JJ., joined,  post,  p.   408 U. S. 648 .  Opinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, announced by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN. These cases arise out of the investigation by a federal grand jury into possible criminal conduct with respect to the release and publication of a classified Defense Department study entitled History of the United States Decision-Making Process on Viet Nam Policy.  This document, popularly known as the Pentagon Papers, bore a Defense security classification of Top Secret-Sensitive.  The crimes being investigated included the retention of public property or records with intent to convert (18 U.S.C. § 641), the gathering and transmitting of national defense information (18 U.S.C. § 73), the concealment or removal of public records or documents (18 U.S.C. § 2071), and conspiracy to commit such offenses and to defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. § 371). Among the witnesses subpoenaed were Leonard S. Rodberg, an assistant to Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska and a resident fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, and Howard Webber, Director of M. I.T. Press. Senator Gravel, as intervenor, [ Footnote 1 ] filed motions to quash the   subpoenas and to require the Government to specify the particular questions to be addressed to Rodberg. [ Footnote 2 ]  He asserted that requiring these witnesses to appear and testify would violate his privilege under the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I, § 6, cl. 1. It appeared that, on the night of June 29, 1971, Senator Gravel, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds of the Senate Public Works Committee, convened a meeting of the subcommittee and there read extensively from a copy of the Pentagon Papers.  He then placed the entire 47 volumes of the study in the public record.  Rodberg had been added to the Senator's staff earlier in the day and assisted Gravel in preparing for and conducting the hearing. [ Footnote 3 ]  Some weeks later there were press reports that Gravel had arranged for the papers to be published by Beacon   Press [ Footnote 4 ] and that members of Gravel's staff had talked with Webber as editor of M.I.T. Press. [ Footnote 5 ] The District Court overruled the motions to quash and to specify questions but entered an order proscribing certain categories of questions.   United States v. Doe,   332 F. Supp. 930  (Mass.1971).  The Government's contention that, for purposes of applying the Speech or Debate Clause the courts were free to inquire into the regularity of the subcommittee meeting was rejected. [ Footnote 6 ]  Because the Clause protected all legislative   acts, it was held to shield from inquiry anything the Senator did at the subcommittee meeting and ""certain acts done in preparation therefor.""   Id.  at 935.  The Senator's privilege also prohibited ""inquiry into things done by Dr. Rodberg as the Senator's agent or assistant which would have been legislative acts, and therefore privileged, if performed by the Senator personally."" Id.  at 937-938. [ Footnote 7 ]  The trial court, however, held the private publication of the documents was not privileged by the Speech or Debate Clause.   Id.  at 936. [ Footnote 8 ] The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the motions to quash but modified the protective order to reflect its own views of the scope of the congressional privilege.   United States v. Doe,  455 F.2d 753 (CA1 1972).  Agreeing that Senator and aide were one for   the purposes of the Speech or Debate Clause, and that the Clause foreclosed inquiry of both Senator and aide with respect to legislative acts, the Court of Appeals also viewed the privilege as barring direct inquiry of the Senator or his aide, but not of third parties, as to the sources of the Senator's information used in performing legislative duties. [ Footnote 9 ]  Although it did not consider private publication by the Senator or Beacon Press to be protected by the Constitution, the Court of Appeals apparently held that neither Senator nor aide could be questioned about it because of a common law privilege akin to the judicially created immunity of executive officers from liability for libel contained in a news release issued in the course of their normal duties.   See Barr v. Matteo,   360 U. S. 564  (1959).  This privilege, fashioned by the Court of Appeals, would not protect third parties from similar inquiries before the grand jury.  As modified by the Court of Appeals, the protective order to be observed by prosecution and grand jury was: ""(1) No witness before the grand jury currently investigating the release of the Pentagon Papers may be questioned about Senator Mike Gravel's conduct at a meeting of the Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds on June 29, 1971, nor, if the questions are directed to the motives or purposes behind the Senator's conduct at that meeting, about any communications with him or with   his aides regarding the activities of the Senator or his aides during the period of their employment, in preparation for and related to said meeting."" ""(2) Dr. Leonard S. Rodberg may not be questioned about his own actions in the broadest sense, including observations and communications, oral or written, by or to him or coming to his attention while being interviewed for, or after having been engaged as a member of Senator Gravel's personal staff to the extent that they were in the course of his employment."" The United States petitioned for certiorari challenging the ruling that aides and other persons may not be questioned with respect to legislative acts and that an aide to a Member of Congress has a common law privilege not to testify before a grand jury with respect to private publication of materials introduced into a subcommittee record.  Senator Gravel also petitioned for certiorari seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals insofar as it held private publication unprotected by the Speech or Debate Clause and asserting that the protective order of the Court of Appeals too narrowly protected against inquiries that a grand jury could direct to third parties.  We granted both petitions. 405 U.S. 916 (1972). I Because the claim is that a Member's aide shares the Member's constitutional privilege, we consider first whether and to what extent Senator Gravel himself is exempt from process or inquiry by a grand jury investigating the commission of a crime.  Our frame of reference is Art. I, § 6, cl. 1, of the Constitution: ""The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United   States.  They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place."" The last sentence of the Clause provides Members of Congress with two distinct privileges.  Except in cases of ""Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace,"" the Clause shields Members from arrest while attending or traveling to and from a session of their House.  History reveals, and prior cases so hold, that this part of the Clause exempts Members from arrest in civil cases only.  ""When the Constitution was adopted, arrests in civil suits were still common in America.  It is only to such arrests that the provision applies.""   Long v. Ansell,   293 U. S. 76 ,   293 U. S. 83  (1934) (footnote omitted). ""Since . . . the terms treason, felony and breach of the peace, as used in the constitutional provision relied upon, excepts from the operation of the privilege all criminal offenses, the conclusion results that the claim of privilege of exemption from arrest and sentence was without merit. . . ."" Williamson v. United States,   207 U. S. 425 ,   207 U. S. 446  (1908). [ Footnote 10 ]  Nor does freedom from arrest confer immunity on a Member from service of process as a defendant in civil matters,  Long v. Ansell, supra,  at   82-83, or as a witness in a criminal case. ""The constitution gives to every man, charged with an offence, the benefit of compulsory process, to secure the attendance of his witnesses.  I do not know of any privilege to exempt members of congress from the service, or the obligations, of a subpoena, in such cases."" United States v. Cooper,  4 Dall. 341 (1800) [omitted] (Chase, J., sitting on Circuit).  It is, therefore, sufficiently plain that the constitutional freedom from arrest does not exempt Members of Congress from the operation of the ordinary criminal laws, even though imprisonment may prevent or interfere with the performance of their duties as Members.   Williamson v. United States, supra; cf. Burton v. United States,   202 U. S. 344  (1906).  Indeed, implicit in the narrow scope of the privilege of freedom from arrest is, as Jefferson noted, the judgment that legislators ought not to stand above the law they create but ought generally to be bound by it as are ordinary persons.  T. Jefferson, Manual of Parliamentary Practice, S.Doc. No. 92-1, p. 437 (1971). In recognition, no doubt, of the force of this part of § 6, Senator Gravel disavows any assertion of general immunity from the criminal law.  But he points out that the last portion of § 6 affords Members of Congress another vital privilege they may not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate in either House.  The claim is not that, while one part of § 6 generally permits prosecutions for treason, felony, and breach of the peace, another part nevertheless broadly forbids them.  Rather, his insistence is that the Speech or Debate Clause, at the very least, protects him from criminal or civil liability and from questioning elsewhere than in the Senate, with respect to the events occurring at the subcommittee hearing at which the Pentagon Papers were introduced into the public record.  To us this claim is incontrovertible.    The Speech or Debate Clause was designed to assure a co-equal branch of the government wide freedom of speech, debate, and deliberation without intimidation or threats from the Executive Branch.  It thus protects Members against prosecutions that directly impinge upon or threaten the legislative process.  We have no doubt that Senator Gravel may not be made to answer either in terms of questions or in terms of defending himself from prosecution -- for the events that occurred at the subcommittee meeting.  Our decision is made easier by the fact that the United States appears to have abandoned whatever position it took to the contrary in the lower court. Even so, the United States strongly urges that, because the Speech or Debate Clause confers a privilege only upon ""Senators and Representatives,"" Rodberg himself has no valid claim to constitutional immunity from grand jury inquiry.  In our view, both courts below correctly rejected this position.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that, for the purpose of construing the privilege a Member and his aide are to be ""treated as one,""  United States v. Doe,  455 F.2d  at 761; or, as the District Court put it:  the ""Speech or Debate Clause prohibits inquiry into things done by Dr. Rodberg as the Senator's agent or assistant which would have been legislative acts, and therefore privileged, if performed by the Senator personally."" United States v. Doe,  332 F. Supp.  at 937-938.  Both courts recognized what the Senate of the United States urgently presses here:  that it is literally impossible, in view of the complexities of the modern legislative process, with Congress almost constantly in session and matters of legislative concern constantly proliferating, for Members of Congress to perform their legislative tasks without the help of aides and assistants; that the day-to-day work of such aides is so critical to the   Members' performance that they must be treated as the latter's alter egos; and that, if they are not so recognized, the central role of the Speech or Debate Clause -- to prevent intimidation of legislators by the Executive and accountability before a possibly hostile judiciary,  United States v. Johnson,   383 U. S. 169 ,   383 U. S. 181  (1966) -- will inevitably be diminished and frustrated. The Court has already embraced similar views in  Barr v. Matteo,   360 U. S. 564  (1959), where, in immunizing the Acting Director of the Office of Rent Stabilization from liability for an alleged libel contained in a press release, the Court held that the executive privilege recognized in prior case could not be restricted to those of cabinet rank.  As stated by Mr. Justice Harlan, the ""privilege is not a badge or emolument of exalted office, but an expression of a policy designed to aid in the effective functioning of government.  The complexities and magnitude of governmental activity have become so great that there must of necessity be a delegation and redelegation of authority as to many functions, and we cannot say that these functions become less important simply because they are exercised by officers of lower rank in the executive hierarchy."" Id.  at   360 U. S. 572 -573 (footnote omitted). It is true that the Clause itself mentions only ""Senators and Representatives,"" but prior cases have plainly not taken a literalistic approach in applying the privilege.  The Clause also speaks only of ""Speech or Debate,"" but the Court's consistent approach has been that to confine the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause to words spoken in debate would be an unacceptably narrow view.  Committee reports, resolutions, and the act of voting are equally covered; ""[i]n short, . . . things generally done in a session of the House by one of its members in relation to the business before it.""   Kilbourn v. Thompson,   103 U. S. 168 ,   103 U. S. 204  (1881), quoted   with approval in  United States v. Johnson,  383 U.S. at   383 U. S. 179 .  Rather than giving the Clause a cramped construction, the Court has sought to implement its fundamental purpose of freeing the legislator from executive and judicial oversight that realistically threatens to control his conduct as a legislator.  We have little doubt that we are neither exceeding our judicial powers nor mistakenly construing the Constitution by holding that the Speech or Debate Clause applies not only to a Member, but also to his aide insofar as the conduct of the latter would be a protected legislative act if performed by the Member himself. Nor can we agree with the United States that our conclusion is foreclosed by  Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, Dombrowski v. Eastland,   387 U. S. 82  (1967), and  Powell v. McCormack,   395 U. S. 486  (1969), where the speech or debate privilege was held unavailable to certain House and committee employees.  Those cases do not hold that persons other than Members of Congress are beyond the protection of the Clause when they perform or aid in the performance of legislative acts.  In  Kilbourn,  the Speech or Debate Clause protected House Members who had adopted a resolution authorizing Kilbourn's arrest; that act was clearly legislative in nature.  But the resolution was subject to judicial review insofar as its execution impinged on a citizen's rights as it did there.  That the House could with impunity order an unconstitutional arrest afforded no protection for those who made the arrest.  The Court quoted with approval from  Stockdale v. Hansard,  9 Ad. & E. 1, 112 Eng.Rep. 1112 (K.B. 1839): ""'So if the speaker, by authority of the House, order an illegal act, though that authority shall exempt him from question, his order shall no more justify the person who executed it than King Charles's warrant for levying ship-money could justify his revenue   officer,'"" 103 U.S. at   103 U. S. 202 . [ Footnote 11 ]  The Speech or Debate Clause could not be construed to immunize an illegal arrest even though directed by an immune legislative act.  The Court was careful to point out that the Members themselves were not implicated in the actual arrest,  id.  at   103 U. S. 200 , and, significantly enough, reserved the question whether there might be circumstances in which ""there may . . . be things done,  in the one House or the other,  of an extraordinary character, for which the members who take part in the act may be held legally responsible."" 103 U.S. at   103 U. S. 204  (emphasis added). Dombrowski v. Eastland, supra,  is little different in principle.  The Speech or Debate Clause there protected a Senator, who was also a subcommittee chairman, but not the subcommittee counsel.  The record contained no evidence of the Senator's involvement in any activity that could result in liability, 387 U.S. at   387 U. S. 84 , whereas the committee counsel was charged with conspiring with state officials to carry out an illegal seizure of records that the committee sought for its own proceedings.   Ibid.   The committee counsel was deemed protected to   some extent by legislative privilege, but it did not shield him from answering as yet unproved charges of conspiring to violate the constitutional rights of private parties.  Unlawful conduct of this kind the Speech or Debate Clause simply did not immunize. Powell v. McCormack  reasserted judicial power to determine the validity of legislative actions impinging on individual rights -- there the illegal exclusion of a representative-elect -- and to afford relief against House aides seeking to implement the invalid resolutions.  The Members themselves were dismissed from the case because shielded by the Speech or Debate Clause both from liability for their illegal legislative act and from having to defend themselves with respect to it.  As in  Kilbourn,  the Court did not reach the question ""whether under the Speech or Debate Clause petitioners would be entitled to maintain this action solely against the members of Congress where no agents participated in the challenged action and no other remedy was available."" 395 U.S. at   395 U. S. 506  n. 26. None of these three cases adopted the simple proposition that immunity was unavailable to congressional or committee employees because they were not Representatives or Senators; rather, immunity was unavailable because they engaged in illegal conduct that was not entitled to Speech or Debate Clause protection.  The three cases reflect a decidedly jaundiced view towards extending the Clause so as to privilege illegal or unconstitutional conduct beyond that essential to foreclose executive control of legislative speech or debate and associated matters such as voting and committee reports and proceedings.  In  Kilbourn,  the Sergeant-at-Arms was executing a legislative order, the issuance of which fell within the Speech or Debate Clause; in  Eastland,  the committee counsel was gathering information for a hearing; and in  Powell,  the   Clerk and Doorkeeper were merely carrying out directions that were protected by the Speech or Debate Cause.  In each case, protecting the rights of others may have to some extent frustrated a planned or completed legislative act; but relief could be afforded without proof of a legislative act or the motives or purposes underlying such an act.  No threat to legislative independence was posed, and Speech or Debate Clause protection did not attach. None of this, as we see it, involves distinguishing between a Senator and his personal aides with respect to legislative immunity.  In  Kilbourn -type situations, both aide and Member should be immune with respect to committee and House action leading to the illegal resolution.  So, too, in  Eastland,  as in this litigation, senatorial aides should enjoy immunity for helping a Member conduct committee hearings.  On the other hand, no prior case has held that Members of Congress would be immune if they executed an invalid resolution by themselves carrying out an illegal arrest, or if, in order to secure information for a hearing, themselves seized the property or invaded the privacy of a citizen.  Neither they nor their aides should be immune from liability or questioning in such circumstances.  Such acts are no more essential to legislating than the conduct held unprotected in  United States v. Johnson,   383 U. S. 169  (1966). [ Footnote 12 ] The United States fears the abuses that history reveals have occurred when legislators are invested with the power to relieve others from the operation of otherwise valid civil and criminal laws.  But these abuses, it seems to us, are for the most part obviated if the privilege applicable to the aide is viewed, as it must be, as the   privilege of the Senator, and invocable only by the Senator or by the aide on the Senator's behalf, [ Footnote 13 ] and if, in all events, the privilege available to the aide is confined to those services that would be immune legislative conduct if performed by the Senator himself.  This view places beyond the Speech or Debate Clause a variety of services characteristically performed by aides for Members of Congress, even though within the scope of their employment.  It likewise provides no protection for criminal conduct threatening the security of the person or property of others, whether performed at the direction of the Senator in preparation for or in execution of a legislative act or done without his knowledge or direction.  Neither does it immunize Senator or aide from testifying at trials or grand jury proceedings involving third-party crimes where the questions do not require testimony about or impugn a legislative act.  Thus, our refusal to distinguish between Senator and aide in applying the Speech or Debate Clause does not mean that Rodberg is for all purposes exempt from grand jury questioning. II We are convinced also that the Court of Appeals correctly determined that Senator Gravel's alleged arrangement with Beacon Press to publish the Pentagon Papers was not protected speech or debate within the meaning of Art. I, § 6, cl. 1, of the Constitution. Historically, the English legislative privilege was not viewed as protecting republication of an otherwise immune libel on the floor of the House.   Stockdale v. Hansard,  9 Ad. & E., at 114, 112 Eng.Rep. at 1156, recognized that, ""[f]or speeches made in Parliament by a member to the prejudice of any other person, or hazardous   to the public peace, that member enjoys complete impunity."" But it was clearly stated that, ""if the calumnious or inflammatory speeches should be reported and published, the law will attach responsibility on the publisher."" [ Footnote 14 ]    This was accepted in  Kilbourn v. Thompson  as a ""sound statement of the legal effect of the Bill of Rights and of the parliamentary law of England"" and as a reasonable basis for inferring ""that the framers of the Constitution meant the same thing by the use of language borrowed from that source.""  103 U.S. at   103 U. S. 202 . Prior cases have read the Speech or Debate Clause ""broadly to effectuate its purposes,""  United States v. Johnson,  383 U.S. at   383 U. S. 180 , and have included within its reach anything ""generally done in a session of the House by one of its members in relation to the business before it.""   Kilbourn v. Thompson,  103 U.S. at   103 U. S. 204 ;  United States v. Johnson,  383 U.S. at   383 U. S. 179 .  Thus, voting by Members and committee reports are protected; and we recognize today -- as the Court has recognized before,  Kilbourn v. Thompson,  103 U.S. at   103 U. S. 204 ;  Tenney v. Brandhove,   341 U. S. 367 ,   341 U. S. 377 -378 (1951) -- that a Member's conduct at legislative committee hearings, although subject to judicial review in various circumstances, as is legislation itself, may not be made the basis for a civil or criminal judgment against a Member because that conduct is within the ""sphere of legitimate legislative activity.""   Id.  at   341 U. S. 376 . [ Footnote 15 ] But the Clause has not been extended beyond the legislative   sphere.  That Senators generally perform certain acts in their official capacity as Senators does not necessarily make all such acts legislative in nature Members of Congress are constantly in touch with the Executive Branch of the Government and with administrative agencies -- they may cajole, and exhort with respect to the administration of a federal statute -- but such conduct, though generally done, is not protected legislative activity.   United States v. Johnson  decided at least this much. ""No argument is made, nor do we think that it could be successfully contended, that the Speech or Debate Clause reaches conduct, such as was involved in the attempt to influence the Department of Justice, that is in no wise related to the due functioning of the legislative process."" 383 U.S. at   383 U. S. 172 .   Cf. Burton v. United States,  202 U.S. at   202 U. S. 367 -368. Legislative acts are not all-encompassing.  The heart of the Clause is speech or debate in either House.  Insofar as the Clause is construed to reach other matters, they must be an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which Members participate in committee and House proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.  As the Court of Appeals put it, the courts have extended the privilege to matters beyond pure speech or debate in either House, but ""only when necessary to prevent indirect impairment of such deliberations.""   United States v. Doe,  455 F.2d  at 760. Here, private publication by Senator Gravel through the cooperation of Beacon Press was in no way essential to the deliberations of the Senate; nor does questioning as to private publication threaten the integrity or independence of the Senate by impermissibly exposing its deliberations to executive influence.  The Senator   had conducted his hearings; the record and any report that was forthcoming were available both to his committee and the Senate.  Insofar as we are advised, neither Congress nor the full committee ordered or authorized the publications. [ Footnote 16 ]  We cannot but conclude that the Senator's arrangements with beacon Press were not part and parcel of the legislative process. There are additional considerations.  Article I, § 6, cl. 1, as we have emphasized, does not purport to confer a general exemption upon Members of Congress from liability or process in criminal cases.  Quite the contrary is true.  While the Speech or Debate Clause recognizes speech, voting, and other legislative acts as exempt from liability that might otherwise attach, it does not privilege either Senator or aide to violate an otherwise valid criminal law in preparing for or implementing legislative acts.  If republication of these classified papers would be a crime under an Act of Congress, it would not be entitled to immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause.  It also appears that the grand jury was pursuing this very subject in the normal course of a valid investigation.  The Speech or Debate Clause does not, in our view, extend immunity to Rodberg, as a Senator's aide, from testifying before the grand jury about the arrangement between Senator Gravel and Beacon Press or about his own participation, if any, in the   alleged transaction, so long as legislative acts of the Senator are not impugned. III Similar considerations lead us to disagree with the Court of Appeals insofar as it fashioned, tentatively at least, a nonconstitutional testimonial privilege protecting Rodberg from any questioning by the grand jury concerning the matter of republication of the Pentagon Papers.  This privilege, thought to be similar to that protecting executive officials from liability for libel,  see Barr v. Matteo,   360 U. S. 564  (1959), was considered advisable ""[t]o the extent that a congressman has responsibility to inform his constituents. . . .""  455 F.2d  at 760.  But we cannot carry a judicially fashioned privilege so far as to immunize criminal conduct proscribed by an Act of Congress or to frustrate the grand jury's inquiry into whether publication of these classified documents violated a federal criminal statute.  The so-called executive privilege has never been applied to shield executive officers from prosecution for crime, the Court of Appeals was quite sure that third parties were neither immune from liability nor from testifying about the republication matter, and we perceive no basis for conferring a testimonial privilege on Rodberg as the Court of Appeals seemed to do. IV We must finally consider, in the light of the foregoing, whether the protective order entered by the Court of Appeals is an appropriate regulation of the pending grand jury proceedings. Focusing first on paragraph two of the order, we think the injunction against interrogating Rodberg with respect to any act, ""in the broadest sense,"" performed by him within the scope of his employment, overly restricts   the scope of grand jury inquiry.  Rodberg's immunity, testimonial or otherwise, extends only to legislative act as to which the Senator himself would be immune.  The grand jury, therefore, if relevant to its investigation into the possible violations of the criminal law, and absent Fifth Amendment objections, may require from Rodberg answers to questions relating to his or the Senator's arrangement, if any, with respect to republication or with respect to third-party conduct under valid investigation by the grand jury, as long as the questions do not implicate legislative action of the Senator.  Neither do we perceive any constitutional or other privilege that shields Rodberg, any more than any other witness, from grand jury question relevant to tracing the source of obviously highly classified documents that came into the Senator's possession and are the basic subject matter of inquiry in this case, as long as no legislative act is implicated by the questions. [ Footnote 17 ] Because the Speech or Debate Clause privilege applies both to Senator and aide, it appear to us that paragraph one of the order, alone, would afford ample protection for the privilege if it forbade questioning any witness, including Rodberg:  (1) concerning the Senator's   conduct, or the conduct of his aides at the June 29, 1971, meeting of the subcommittee; [ Footnote 18 ] (2) concerning the motives and purposes behind the Senator' conduct, or that of his aides, at that meeting; (3) concerning communications between the Senator and his aides during the term of their employment and related to said meeting or any other legislative act of the Senator; (4) except as it proves relevant to investigating possible third-party crime, concerning any act, in itself, not criminal, performed by the Senator, or by his aides in the course of their employment, in preparation for the subcommittee hearing.  We leave the final form of such an order to the Court of Appeals in the first instance, or, if that court prefers, to the District Court. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the cases are remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. So ordered. * Together with No. 71-1026,  United States v. Gravel,  also on certiorari to the same court. [ Footnote 1 ] The District Court permitted Senator Gravel to intervene in the proceeding on Dr. Rodberg's motion to quash the subpoena ordering his appearance before the grand jury and accepted motions from Gravel to quash the subpoena and to specify the exact nature of the questions to be asked Rodberg.  The Government contested Gravel's standing to appeal the trial court's disposition of these motions on the ground that, had the subpoena been directed to the Senator, he could not have appealed from a denial of a motion to quash without first refusing to comply with the subpoena and being held in contempt.   United States v. Ryan,   402 U. S. 530  (1971);  Cobbledick v. United States,   309 U. S. 323  (1940).  The Court of Appeals,  United States v. Doe,  455 F.2d 753, 756-757 (CA1 1972), held that, because the subpoena was directed to third parties, who could not be counted on to risk contempt to protect intervenor's rights, Gravel might be ""powerless to avert the mischief of the order"" if not permitted to appeal, citing  Perlman v. United States,   247 U. S. 7 ,   247 U. S. 13  (1918).  The United States does not here challenge the propriety of the appeal. [ Footnote 2 ] Dr. Rodberg, who filed his own motion to quash the subpoena directing his appearance and testimony, appeared as  amici curiae  both in the Court of Appeals and this Court.  Technically, Rodberg states, he is a party to No. 71-1026, insofar as the Government appeals from the protective order entered by the District Court.  However, since Gravel intervened, Rodberg does not press the point.  Brief of Leonard S. Rodberg as  Amicus Curiae  2 n. 2. [ Footnote 3 ] The District Court found ""that, ""as personal assistant to movant [Gravel], Dr. Rodberg assisted movant in preparing for disclosure and subsequently disclosing to movant's colleagues and constituents, at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, the contents of the so-called  Pentagon Papers,' which were critical of the Executive's conduct in the field of foreign relations.""""  United States v. Doe,   332 F. Supp. 930 , 932 (Mas.1971). [ Footnote 4 ] Beacon Press is a division of the Unitarian Universalist Association, which appeared here as  amicus curiae  in support of the position taken by Senator Gravel. [ Footnote 5 ] Gravel so alleged in his motion to intervene in the Webber matter and to quash the subpoena ordering Webber to appear and testify.  App. 15-18. [ Footnote 6 ] The Government maintained that Congress does not enjoy unlimited power to conduct business and that judicial review has often been exercised to curb extra-legislative incursions by legislative committees, citing  Watkins v. United States,   354 U. S. 178  (1957);  McGrain v. Daugherty,   273 U. S. 135  (1927);  Hentoff v. Ichord,   318 F. Supp. 1175  (DC 1970), at least where such incursions are unrelated to a legitimate legislative purpose.  It was alleged that Gravel had ""convened a special, unauthorized, and untimely meeting of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Works (at midnight on June 29, 1971), for the purpose of reading the documents and thereafter placed all unread portions in the subcommittee record, with Dr. Rodberg soliciting publication following the meeting."" App. 9.  The District Court rejected the contention: ""Senator Gravel has suggested that the availability of funds for the construction and improvement of public buildings and grounds has been affected by the necessary costs of the war in Vietnam, and that therefore the development and conduct of the war is properly within the concern of his subcommittee.  The court rejects the Government's argument without detailed consideration of the merits of the Senator's position, on the basis of the general rule restricting judicial inquiry into matters of legislative purpose and operations."" United States v. Doe,  332 F. Supp.  at 935.  Cases such as  Watkins, supra,  were distinguished on the ground that they concerned the power of Congress under the Constitution: ""It has not been suggested by the Government that the Subcommittee itself is unauthorized, nor that the war in Vietnam is an issue beyond the purview of congressional debate and action.  Also, the individual rights at stake in these proceedings are not those of a witness before a congressional committee or of a subject of a committee's investigation, but only those of a congressman and member of his personal staff who claim 'intimidation by the executive.'"" 332 F. Supp.  at 936. [ Footnote 7 ] The District Court thought that Rodberg could be questioned concerning his own conduct prior to joining the Senator's staff and concerning the activities of third parties with whom Rodberg and Gravel dealt.   Id.  at 934.                         . [ Footnote 8 ] The protective order entered by the District Court provided as follows: ""(1) No witness before the grand jury currently investigating the release of the Pentagon Papers may be questioned about Senator Mike Gravel's conduct at a meeting of the Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds on June 29, 1971 nor about things done by the Senator in preparation for and intimately related to said meeting."" ""(2) Dr. Leonard S. Rodberg may not be questioned about his own actions on June 29, 1971, after having been engaged as a member of Senator Gravel's personal staff to the extent that they were taken at the Senator's direction either at a meeting of the Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds or in preparation for and intimately related to said meeting."" Id.  at 938. [ Footnote 9 ] The Court of Appeals thought third parties could be questioned as to their own conduct regarding the Pentagon Papers, ""including their dealing with intervenor or his aides.""   United States v. Doe,  455 F.2d  at 761.  The court found no merit in the claim that such parties should be shielded from questioning under the Speech or Debate Clause concerning their own wrongful acts, even if such questioning may bring the Senator's conduct into question.   Id.  at 758 n. 2. [ Footnote 10 ] Williamson, United States Congressman, had been found guilty of conspiring to commit subornation of perjury in connection with proceedings for the purchase of public land.  He objected to the court's passing sentence upon him and particularly protested that any imprisonment would deprive him of his constitutional right to ""go to, attend at and return from the ensuing session of Congress.""   Williamson v. United States,   207 U. S. 425 ,   207 U. S. 433  (1908).  The Court rejected the contention that the Speech or Debate Clause freed legislators from accountability for criminal conduct. [ Footnote 11 ] In  Kilbourn v. Thompson,   103 U. S. 168 ,   103 U. S. 198  (1881), the Court noted a second example, used by Mr. Justice Coleridge in  Stockdale v. Hansard,  9 Ad. & E. 1, 225-226, 112 Eng.Rep. 1112, 1196-1197 (K.B. 1839): ""'Let me suppose, by way of illustration, an extreme case; the House of Commons resolves that any one wearing a dress of a particular manufacture is guilty of a breach of privilege, and orders the arrest of such persons by the constable of the parish.  An arrest is made and action brought, to which the order of the House is pleaded as a justification. . . .  In such a case as the one supposed, the plaintiff's counsel would insist on the distinction between power and privilege; and no lawyer can seriously doubt that it exists; but the argument confounds them, and forbids us to enquire, in any particular case, whether it ranges under the one or the other.  I can find no principle which sanctions this.'"" [ Footnote 12 ] Senator Gravel is willing to assume that, if he personally had ""stolen"" the Pentagon Papers, and that act were a crime, he could be prosecuted, as could aides or other assistants who participated in the theft.  Consolidated Brief for Senator Gravel 93. [ Footnote 13 ] It follows that an aide's claim of privilege can be repudiated and thus waived by the Senator. [ Footnote 14 ] Stockdale extensively reviewed the precedents and their interplay with the privilege so forcefully recognized in the Bill of Rights of 1689: ""That the Freedom of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament."" 1 W. & M., Sess. 2, c. 2.  From these cases, including  Rex v. Creevey,  1 M. & S. 273, 105 Eng.Rep. 102 (K.B. 1813);  Rex v. Wright,  8 T.R. 293, 101 Eng.Rep. 1396 (K.B. 1799);  Rex v. Abingdon,  1 Esp. 226, 170 Eng.Rep. 337 (N.P. 1794);  Rex v. Williams,  2 Show.K.B. 471, 89 Eng.Rep. 1048 (1686), it is apparent that, to the extent English precedent is relevant to the Speech or Debate Clause, there is little, if any, support for Senator Gravel's position with respect to republication.  Parliament reacted to  Stockdale v. Hansard  by adopting the Parliamentary Papers Act of 1840, 3 & 4 Vict., c. 9, which stayed proceedings in all cases where it could be shown that publication was by order of a House of Parliament and was a  bona fide  report, printed and circulated without malice.   See generally  C. Wittke, The History of English Parliamentary Privilege (1921). Gravel urges that  Stockdale v. Hansard  was later repudiated in  Wason v. Walter,  L.R. 4 Q.B. 73 (1868), which held a proprietor immune from civil libel for an accurate republication of a debate in the House of Lords.  But the immunity established in  Wason  was not founded on parliamentary privilege,  id.  at 84, but upon analogy to the privilege for reporting judicial proceedings.   Id.  at 87-90.  The  Wason  court stated its ""unhesitating and unqualified adhesion"" to the ""masterly judgments"" rendered in  Stockdale  and characterized the question before it as whether republication, quite apart from any assertion of parliamentary privilege, was ""in itself privileged and lawful.""   Id.  at 86-87.  That the privileges for nonmalicious republication of parliamentary and judicial proceedings -- later established as qualified -- were construed as coextensive in all respects,  id.  at 95, further underscores the inappositeness of reading  Wason  as based upon parliamentary privilege that, like the Speech or Debate Clause, is absolute.  Much later, Holdsworth was to comment that, at the time of  Wason,  the distinction between absolute and qualified privilege had not been worked out, and that the ""part played by malice in the tort and crime of defamation"" probably helped retard recognition of a qualified privilege.  8 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 377 (1926). [ Footnote 15 ] The Court in  Tenney v. Brandhove,   341 U. S. 367 ,   341 U. S. 376 -377 (1951), was equally clear that ""legislative activity"" is not all-encompassing, nor may its limits be established by the Legislative Branch: ""Legislatures may not of course acquire power by an unwarranted extension of privilege.  The House of Commons' claim of power to establish the limits of its privilege has been little more than a pretense since  Ashby v. White,  2 Ld.Raym. 938, 3 id. 320.  This Court has not hesitated to sustain the rights of private individuals when it found Congress was acting outside its legislative role.  Kilbourn v. Thompson,   103 U. S. 168 ;  Marshall v. Gordon,   243 U. S. 521 ;  compare McGrain v. Daugherty,   273 U. S. 135 ,   273 U. S. 176 ."" [ Footnote 16 ] The sole constitutional claim asserted here is based on the Speech or Debate Clause.  We need not address issues that may arise when Congress or either House, as distinguished from a single Member, orders the publication and/or public distribution of committee hearings, reports, or other materials.  Of course, Art. I, § 5, cl. 3, requires that each House""keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy.""  This Clause has not been the subject of extensive judicial examination.   See Field v. Clark,   143 U. S. 649 ,   143 U. S. 670 -671 (1892);  United States v. Ballin,   144 U. S. 1 ,   144 U. S. 4  (1892). [ Footnote 17 ] The Court of Appeals held that the Speech or Debate Clause protects aides as well as Senators, and that, while third parties may be questioned about the source of a Senator's information, neither aide nor Senator need answer such inquiries.  The Government's position is that the aide has no protection under the Speech or Debate Clause, and may be questioned even about legislative acts.  A contrary ruling, the Government fears, would invite great abuse.  On the other hand, Gravel contends that the Court of Appeals insufficiently protected the Senator both with respect to the matter of republication and with respect to the scope of inquiry permitted the grand jury in questioning third-party witnesses with whom the Senator and his aides dealt.  Hence, we are of the view that both the question of the aide's immunity and the question of the extent of that immunity are properly before us in this case.  And surely we are not bound by the Government's view of the scope of the privilege. [ Footnote 18 ] Having established that neither the Senator nor Rodberg is subject to liability for what occurred at the subcommittee hearing, we perceive no basis for inquiry of either Rodberg or third parties on this subject.  If it proves material to establish for the record the fact of publication at the subcommittee hearing, which seems undisputed, the public record of the hearing would appear sufficient for this purpose.  We do not intend to imply, however, that in no grand jury investigations or criminal trials of third parties may third-party witnesses be interrogated about legislative acts of Members of Congress.  As for inquiry of Rodberg about third-party crimes, we are quite sure that the District Court has ample power to keep the grand jury proceedings within proper bounds and to foreclose improvident harassment and fishing expeditions into the affairs of a Member of Congress that are no proper concern of the grand jury or the Executive Branch."

 Syllabus   The First Amendment does not relieve a newspaper reporter of the obligation that all citizens have to respond to a grand jury subpoena and answer questions relevant to a criminal investigation, and therefore the Amendment does not afford him a constitutional testimonial privilege for an agreement he makes to conceal facts relevant to a grand jury's investigation of a crime or to conceal the criminal conduct of his source or evidence thereof.

Opinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, announced by THE CHIEF JUSTICE. The issue in these cases is whether requiring newsmen to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries abridges the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment.  We hold that it does not. I The writ of certiorari in No. 70-85,  Branzburg v. Hayes  and Meigs, brings before us two judgments of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, both involving petitioner Branzburg, a staff reporter for the Courier-Journal, a daily newspaper published in Louisville, Kentucky. On November 15, 1969, the Courier-Journal carried a story under petitioner's by-line describing in detail his observations of two young residents of Jefferson County synthesizing hashish from marihuana, an activity which, they asserted, earned them about $5,000 in three weeks.  The article included a photograph of a pair of hands working above a laboratory table on which was a substance identified by the caption as hashish.  The article stated that petitioner had promised not to   reveal the identity of the two hashish makers. [ Footnote 1 ]  Petitioner was shortly subpoenaed by the Jefferson County grand jury; he appeared, but refused to identify the individuals he had seen possessing marihuana or the persons he had seen making hashish from marihuana. [ Footnote 2 ]  A state trial court judge [ Footnote 3 ] ordered petitioner to answer these questions and rejected his contention that the Kentucky reporters' privilege statute, Ky.Rev.Stat. § 421.100 (1962) [ Footnote 4 ] the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, or §§ 1, 2, and 8 of the Kentucky Constitution authorized his refusal to answer.  Petitioner then sought prohibition and mandamus in the Kentucky Court of Appeals on the same ground, but the Court of Appeals denied the petition.   Branzburg v.     Pound,   461 S.W.2d 345  (1970),  as modified on denial of rehearing,  Jan. 22, 1971.  It held that petitioner had abandoned his First Amendment argument in a supplemental memorandum he had filed and tacitly rejected his argument based on the Kentucky Constitution.  It also construed Ky.Rev.Stat. § 421.100 as affording a newsman the privilege of refusing to divulge the identity of an informant who supplied him with information, but held that the statute did not permit a reporter to refuse to testify about events he had observed personally, including the identities of those persons he had observed. The second case involving petitioner Branzburg arose out of his later story published on January 10, 1971, which described in detail the use of drugs in Frankfort, Kentucky.  The article reported that, in order to provide a comprehensive survey of the ""drug scene"" in Frankfort, petitioner had ""spent two weeks interviewing several dozen drug users in the capital city,"" and had seen some of them smoking marihuana.  A number of conversations with and observations of several unnamed drug users were recounted.  Subpoenaed to appear before a Franklin County grand jury ""to testify in the matter of violation of statutes concerning use and sale of drugs,"" petitioner Branzburg moved to quash the summons; [ Footnote 5 ] the motion was denied, although   an order was issued protecting Branzburg from revealing ""confidential associations, sources or information"" but requiring that he ""answer any questions which concern or pertain to any criminal act, the commission of which was actually observed by [him].""  Prior to the time he was slated to appear before the grand jury, petitioner sought mandamus and prohibition from the Kentucky Court of Appeals, arguing that, if he were forced to go before the grand jury or to answer questions regarding the identity of informants or disclose information given to him in confidence, his effectiveness as a reporter would be greatly damaged.  The Court of Appeals once again denied the requested writs, reaffirming its construction of Ky.Rev.Stat. § 421.100, and rejecting petitioner's claim of a First Amendment privilege.  It distinguished  Caldwell v. United States,  434 F.2d 1081 (CA9 1970), and it also announced its ""misgivings"" about that decision, asserting that it represented ""a drastic departure from the generally recognized rule that the sources of information of a newspaper reporter are not privileged under the First Amendment.""  It characterized petitioner's fear that his ability to obtain   news would be destroyed as ""so tenuous that it does not, in the opinion of this court, present an issue of abridgement of the freedom of the press within the meaning of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States."" Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review both judgments of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and we granted the writ. [ Footnote 6 ]  402 U.S. 942 (1971).  In re Pappas,  No. 70-94, originated when petitioner Pappas, a television newsman-photographer working out of the Providence, Rhode Island, office of a New Bedford, Massachusetts, television station, was called to New Bedford on July 30, 1970, to report on civil disorders there which involved fires and other turmoil.  He intended to cover a Black Panther news conference at that group's headquarters in a boarded-up store.  Petitioner found the streets around the store barricaded, but he ultimately gained entrance to the area and recorded and photographed a prepared statement read by one of the Black Panther leaders at about 3 p.m. [ Footnote 7 ]  He then asked for and received permission to reenter the area.  Returning at about 9 o'clock, he was allowed to enter and remain inside Panther headquarters.  As a condition of entry, Pappas agreed not to disclose anything he saw or heard inside the store except an anticipated police raid, which Pappas, ""on his own,"" was free to photograph and report as he wished.  Pappas stayed inside the headquarters for about three hours, but there was no police raid, and petitioner wrote no story and did not otherwise reveal what had occurred in the store while he was there.  Two months later, petitioner was summoned before the Bristol   County Grand Jury and appeared, answered questions as to his name, address, employment, and what he had seen and heard outside Panther headquarters, but refused to answer any questions about what had taken place inside headquarters while he was there, claiming that the First Amendment afforded him a privilege to protect confidential informants and their information.  A second summons was then served upon him, again directing him to appear before the grand jury and ""to give such evidence as he knows relating to any matters which may be inquired of on behalf of the Commonwealth before . . . the Grand Jury.""  His motion to quash on First Amendment and other grounds was denied by the trial judge who, noting the absence of a statutory newsman's privilege in Massachusetts, ruled that petitioner had no constitutional privilege to refuse to divulge to the grand jury what he had seen and heard, including the identity of persons he had observed.  The case was reported for decision to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. [ Footnote 8 ]  The record there did not include a transcript of the hearing on the motion to quash, nor did it reveal the specific questions petitioner had refused to answer, the expected nature of his testimony, the nature of the grand jury investigation, or the likelihood of the grand jury's securing the information it sought from petitioner by other means. [ Footnote 9 ]  The   Supreme Judicial Court, however, took ""judicial notice that, in July, 1970, there were serious civil disorders in New Bedford, which involved street barricades, exclusion of the public from certain streets, fires, and similar turmoil.  We were told at the arguments that there was gunfire in certain streets.  We assume that the grand jury investigation was an appropriate effort to discover and indict those responsible for criminal acts."" 358 Mass. 604, 607,  266 N.E.2d 297 , 299 (1971).  The court then reaffirmed prior Massachusetts holdings that testimonial privileges were ""exceptional"" and ""limited,"" stating that ""[t]he principle that the public  has a right to every man's evidence'"" had usually been preferred, in the Commonwealth, to countervailing interests.   Ibid.   The court rejected the holding of the Ninth Circuit in  Caldwell v. United States, supra,  and
 ""adhere[d] to the view that there exists no constitutional newsman's privilege, either qualified or absolute, to refuse to appear and testify before a court or grand jury. [ Footnote 10 ]"" 358 Mass. at 612, 266 N.E.2d  at 302-303.  Any adverse effect upon the free dissemination of news by virtue of petitioner's being called to testify was deemed to be only ""indirect, theoretical, and uncertain.""   Id.  at 612, 266 N.E.2d  at 302.  The court concluded that ""[t]he obligation of newsmen . . . is that of every citizen . . . to appear when summoned, with relevant written or other material when required, and to answer relevant and reasonable inquiries."" Id.  at 612, 266 N.E.2d  at 303.  The court nevertheless noted that grand juries were subject to supervision by the presiding   judge, who had the duty ""to prevent oppressive, unnecessary, irrelevant, and other improper inquiry and investigation,""  ibid.,  to insure that a witness' Fifth Amendment rights were not infringed, and to assess the propriety, necessity, and pertinence of the probable testimony to the investigation in progress. [ Footnote 11 ] The burden was deemed to be on the witness to establish the impropriety of the summons or the questions asked.  The denial of the motion to quash was affirmed, and we granted a writ of certiorari to petitioner Pappas.  402 U.S. 942 (1971). United States v. Caldwell,  No. 70-57, arose from subpoenas issued by a federal grand jury in the Northern District of California to respondent Earl Caldwell, a reporter for the New York Times assigned to cover the Black Panther Party and other black militant groups.  A subpoena  duces tecum  was served on respondent on February 2, 1970, ordering him to appear before the grand jury to testify and to bring with him notes and tape recordings of interviews given him for publication by officers and spokesmen of the Black Panther Party concerning the aims, purposes, and activities of that organization. [ Footnote 12 ]  Respondent objected to the scope   of this subpoena, and an agreement between his counsel and the Government attorneys resulted in a continuance.  A second subpoena, served on March 16, omitted the documentary requirement and simply ordered Caldwell ""to appear . . . to testify before the Grand Jury.""  Respondent and his employer, the New York Times, [ Footnote 13 ] moved to quash on the ground that the unlimited breadth of the subpoenas and the fact that Caldwell would have to appear in secret before the grand jury would destroy his working relationship with the Black Panther Party and ""suppress vital First Amendment freedoms . . . by driving a wedge of distrust and silence between the news media and the militants.""  App. 7.  Respondent argued that ""so drastic an incursion upon First Amendment freedoms"" should not be permitted ""in the absence of a compelling governmental interest -- not shown here -- in requiring Mr. Caldwell's appearance before the grand jury.""   Ibid.   The motion was supported by  amicus curiae  memoranda from other publishing concerns and by affidavits from newsmen asserting the unfavorable impact on news sources of requiring reporters to appear before grand juries.  The Government filed three memoranda in opposition to the motion to quash, each supported by affidavits.  These documents stated that the grand jury was investigating, among other things, possible violations of a number of criminal statutes, including 18 U.S.C. § 871 (threats against the President), 18 U.S.C.   § 1751 (assassination, attempts to assassinate, conspiracy to assassinate the President), 18 U.S.C. § 231 (civil disorders), 18 U.S.C. § 2101 (interstate travel to incite a riot), and 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (mail frauds and swindles).  It was recited that, on November 15, 1969, an officer of the Black Panther Party made a publicly televised speech in which he had declared that ""[w]e will kill Richard Nixon"" and that this threat had been repeated in three subsequent issues of the Party newspaper.  App. 66, 77.  Also referred to were various writings by Caldwell about the Black Panther Party, including an article published in the New York Times on December 14, 1969, stating that ""[i]n their role as the vanguard in a revolutionary struggle, the Panthers have picked up guns,"" and quoting the Chief of Staff of the Party as declaring: ""We advocate the very direct overthrow of the Government by way of force and violence.  By picking up guns and moving against it because we recognize it as being oppressive and, in recognizing that, we know that the only solution to it is armed struggle [ sic ]."" App. 62.  The Government also stated that the Chief of Staff of the Party had been indicted by the grand jury on December 3, 1969, for uttering threats against the life of the President in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 871, and that various efforts had been made to secure evidence of crimes under investigation through the immunization of persons allegedly associated with the Black Panther Party. On April 6, the District Court denied the motion to quash,  Application of Caldwell,   311 F. Supp. 358  (ND Cal.1970), on the ground that "" every person  within the jurisdiction of the government"" is bound to testify upon being properly summoned.   Id.  at 360 (emphasis in original).  Nevertheless, the court accepted respondent's First Amendment arguments to the extent of issuing a protective order providing that, although respondent had to divulge   whatever information had been given to him for publication, he ""shall not be required to reveal confidential associations, sources or information received, developed or maintained by him as a professional journalist in the course of his efforts to gather news for dissemination to the public through the press or other news media."" The court held that the First Amendment afforded respondent a privilege to refuse disclosure of such confidential information until there had been ""a showing by the Government of a compelling and overriding national interest in requiring Mr. Caldwell's testimony which cannot be served by any alternative means."" Id.  at 362. Subsequently, [ Footnote 14 ] the term of the grand jury expired, a new grand jury was convened, and a new subpoena  ad testificandum  was issued and served on May 22, 1970.  A new motion to quash by respondent and memorandum in opposition by the Government were filed, and, by stipulation of the parties, the motion was submitted on the prior record.  The court denied the motion to quash, repeating the protective provisions in its prior order but this time directing Caldwell to appear before the grand jury pursuant to the May 22 subpoena.  Respondent refused to appear before the grand jury, and the court issued an order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.  Upon his further refusal to go before the grand jury, respondent was ordered committed for contempt until such time as he complied with the court's order or until the expiration of the term of the grand jury.  Respondent Caldwell appealed the contempt order, [ Footnote 15 ] and the Court of Appeals reversed.   Caldwell v. United States,  434 F.2d 1081 (CA9 1970).  Viewing the issue before it as whether Caldwell was required to appear before the grand jury at all, rather than the scope of permissible interrogation, the court first determined that the First Amendment provided a qualified testimonial privilege to newsmen; in its view, requiring a reporter like Caldwell to testify would deter his informants from communicating with him in the future and would cause him to censor his writings in an effort to avoid being subpoenaed.  Absent compelling reasons for requiring his testimony, he was held privileged to withhold it.  The court also held, for similar First Amendment reasons, that, absent some special showing of necessity by the Government, attendance by Caldwell at a secret meeting of the grand jury was something he was privileged to refuse because of the potential impact of such an appearance on the flow of news to the public.  We granted the United States' petition for certiorari. [ Footnote 16 ]  402 U.S. 942 (1971). II Petitioners Branzburg and Pappas and respondent Caldwell press First Amendment claims that may be simply put:  that, to gather news, it is often necessary to agree either not to identify the source of information published or to publish only part of the facts revealed, or both; that, if the reporter is nevertheless   forced to reveal these confidences to a grand jury, the source so identified and other confidential sources of other reporters will be measurably deterred from furnishing publishable information, all to the detriment of the free flow of information protected by the First Amendment.  Although the newsmen in these cases do not claim an absolute privilege against official interrogation in all circumstances, they assert that the reporter should not be forced either to appear or to testify before a grand jury or at trial until and unless sufficient grounds are shown for believing that the reporter possesses information relevant to a crime the grand jury is investigating, that the information the reporter has is unavailable from other sources, and that the need for the information is sufficiently compelling to override the claimed invasion of First Amendment interests occasioned by the disclosure.  Principally relied upon are prior cases emphasizing the importance of the First Amendment guarantees to individual development and to our system of representative government, [ Footnote 17 ] decisions requiring that official action with adverse impact on First Amendment rights be justified by a public interest that is ""compelling"" or ""paramount,"" [ Footnote 18 ] and those precedents establishing the principle that justifiable governmental goals may not be achieved by unduly broad means having an unnecessary impact   on protected rights of speech, press, or association. [ Footnote 19 ]  The heart of the claim is that the burden on news gathering resulting from compelling reporters to disclose confidential information outweighs any public interest in obtaining the information. [ Footnote 20 ] We do not question the significance of free speech, press, or assembly to the country's welfare.  Nor is it suggested that news gathering does not qualify for First Amendment protection; without some protection for seeking out the news, freedom of the press could be eviscerated.  But these cases involve no intrusions upon speech or assembly, no prior restraint or restriction on what the press may publish, and no express or implied command that the press publish what it prefers to withhold.  No exaction or tax for the privilege of publishing, and no penalty, civil or criminal, related to the content of published material is at issue here.  The use of confidential sources by the press is not forbidden or restricted; reporters remain free to seek news from   any source by means within the law.  No attempt is made to require the press to publish its sources of information or indiscriminately to disclose them on request. The sole issue before us is the obligation of reporters to respond to grand jury subpoenas as other citizens do, and to answer questions relevant to an investigation into the commission of crime.  Citizens generally are not constitutionally immune from grand jury subpoenas, and neither the First Amendment nor any other constitutional provision protects the average citizen from disclosing to a grand jury information that he has received in confidence. [ Footnote 21 ]  The claim is, however, that reporters are exempt from these obligations because, if forced to respond to subpoenas and identify their sources or disclose other confidences, their informants will refuse or be reluctant to furnish newsworthy information in the future.  This asserted burden on news gathering is said to make compelled testimony from newsmen constitutionally suspect, and to require a privileged position for them. It is clear that the First Amendment does not invalidate every incidental burdening of the press that may result from the enforcement of civil or criminal statutes of general applicability.  Under prior cases, otherwise valid laws serving substantial public interests may be enforced against the press as against others, despite   the possible burden that may be imposed.  The Court has emphasized that ""[t]he publisher of a newspaper has no special immunity from the application of general laws.  He has no special privilege to invade the rights and liberties of others."" Associated Press v. NLRB,   301 U. S. 103 ,   301 U. S. 132 -133 (1937).  It was there held that the Associated Press, a news-gathering and disseminating organization, was not exempt from the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act.  The holding was reaffirmed in  Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling,   327 U. S. 186 ,   327 U. S. 192 -193 (1946), where the Court rejected the claim that applying the Fair Labor Standards Act to a newspaper publishing business would abridge the freedom of press guaranteed by the First Amendment.   See also Mabee v. White Plains Publishing Co.,   327 U. S. 178  (1946).   Associated Press v. United States,   326 U. S. 1  (1945), similarly overruled assertions that the First Amendment precluded application of the Sherman Act to a newsgathering and disseminating organization.   Cf. Indiana Farmer's Guide Publishing Co. v. Prairie Farmer Publishing Co.,   293 U. S. 268 ,   293 U. S. 276  (1934);  Citizen Publish in Co. v. United States,   394 U. S. 131 ,   394 U. S. 139  (1969);  Lorain Journal Co. v. United States,   342 U. S. 143 ,   342 U. S. 155 -156 (1951).  Likewise, a newspaper may be subjected to nondiscriminatory forms of general taxation.   Grosjean v. American Press Co.,   297 U. S. 233 ,   297 U. S. 250  (1936);  Murdock v. Pennsylvania,   319 U. S. 105 ,   319 U. S. 112  (1943). The prevailing view is that the press is not free to publish with impunity everything and anything it desires to publish.  Although it may deter or regulate what is said or published, the press may not circulate knowing or reckless falsehoods damaging to private reputation without subjecting itself to liability for damages, including punitive damages, or even criminal prosecution.   See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 ,    376 U. S. 279 -280 (1964);  Garrison v. Louisiana,   379 U. S. 64 ,   379 U. S. 74  (1964);  Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts,   388 U. S. 130 ,   388 U. S. 147  (1967) (opinion of Harlan, J.,);  Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,   401 U. S. 265 ,   401 U. S. 277  (1971).  A newspaper or a journalist may also be punished for contempt of court, in appropriate circumstances.   Craig v. Harney,   331 U. S. 367 ,   331 U. S. 377 -378 (1947). It has generally been held that the First Amendment does not guarantee the press a constitutional right of special access to information not available to the public generally.   Zemel v. Rusk,   381 U. S. 1 ,   381 U. S. 16 -17 (1965);  New York Times Co. v. United States,   403 U. S. 713 ,   403 U. S. 728 -730 (1971), (STEWART, J., concurring);  Tribune Review Publishing Co. v. Thomas,  254 F.2d 883, 885 (CA3 1958);  In the Matter of United Press Assns. v. Valente,   308 N.Y. 71 , 77, 123 N.E.2d 777, 778 (1954).  In  Zemel v. Rusk, supra,  for example, the Court sustained the Government's refusal to validate passports to Cuba even though that restriction ""render[ed] less than wholly free the flow of information concerning that country.""   Id.  at   381 U. S. 16 .  The ban on travel was held constitutional, for ""[t]he right to speak and publish does not carry with it the unrestrained right to gather information.""   Id.  at   381 U. S. 17 . [ Footnote 22 ] Despite the fact that news gathering may be hampered, the press is regularly excluded from grand jury proceedings, our own conferences, the meetings of other official bodies gathered in executive session, and the meetings of private organizations.  Newsmen have no constitutional right of access to the scenes of crime or   disaster when the general public is excluded, and they may be prohibited from attending or publishing information about trials if such restrictions re necessary to assure a defendant a fair trial before an impartial tribunal.  In  Sheppard v. Maxwell,   384 U. S. 333  (1966), for example, the Court reversed a state court conviction where the trial court failed to adopt ""stricter rules governing the use of the courtroom by newsmen, as Sheppard's counsel requested,"" neglected to insulate witnesses from the press, and made no ""effort to control the release of leads, information, and gossip to the press by police officers, witnesses, and the counsel for both sides.""   Id.  at   384 U. S. 358 ,   384 U. S. 359 . ""[T]he trial court might well have proscribed extrajudicial statements by any lawyer, party, witness, or court official which divulged prejudicial matters."" Id.  at   384 U. S. 361 .   See also Estes v. Texas,   381 U. S. 532 ,   381 U. S. 539 -540 (1965);  Rideau v. Louisiana,   373 U. S. 723 ,   373 U. S. 726  (1963). It is thus not surprising that the great weight of authority is that newsmen are not exempt from the normal duty of appearing before a grand jury and answering questions relevant to a criminal investigation.  At common law, courts consistently refused to recognize the existence of any privilege authorizing a newsman to refuse to reveal confidential information to a grand jury.   See, e.g., Ex Parte Lawrence,  116 Cal. 298, 48 P. 124 (1897);  Plunkett v. Hamilton,  136 Ga. 72, 70 S.E. 781 (1911);  Clein v. State,   52 So. 2d 117  (Fla.1950);  In re Grunow,  84 N.J.L. 235, 85 A. 1011 (1913);  People ex rel. Mooney v. Sheriff,  269 N.Y. 291, 199 N.E. 415 (1936);  Joslyn v. People,  67 Colo. 297, 184 P. 375 (1919);  Adams v. Associated Press,  46 F.R.D. 439 (SD Tex.1969);  Brewster v. Boston Herald-Traveler Corp.,  20 F.R.D. 416 (Mass.1957).   See generally  Annot., 7 A.L.R.3d 591 (1966).  In 1958, a news gatherer asserted for the first time that the First Amendment   exempted confidential information from public disclosure pursuant to a subpoena issued in a civil suit,  Garland v. Torre,  259 F.2d 545 (CA2),  cert. denied,  358 U.S. 910 (1958), but the claim was denied, and this argument has been almost uniformly rejected since then, although there are occasional dicta that, in circumstances not presented here, a newsman might be excused.   In re Goodfader,  45 Haw. 317,  367 P.2d 472  (1961);  In re Taylor,  412 Pa. 32, 193 A.2d 181 (1963);  State v. Buchanan,  250 Ore. 244,  436 P.2d 729 ,  cert. denied,  392 U.S. 905 (1968);  Murphy v. Colorado  (No.19604, Sup.Ct.Colo.),  cert. denied,  365 U.S. 843 (1961) (unreported, discussed in  In re Goodfader, supra,  at 366, 367 P.2d  at 498 (Mizuha, J., dissenting)).  These courts have applied the presumption against the existence of an asserted testimonial privilege,  United States v. Bryan,   339 U. S. 323 ,   339 U. S. 331  (1950), and have concluded that the First Amendment interest asserted by the newsman was outweighed by the general obligation of a citizen to appear before a grand jury or at trial, pursuant to a subpoena, and give what information he possesses.  The opinions of the state courts in  Branzburg  and  Pappas  are typical of the prevailing view, although a few recent cases, such as  Caldwell,  have recognized and given effect to some form of constitutional newsman's privilege.   See State v. Knops,  49 Wis.2d 647,  183 N.W.2d 93  (1971) (dictum);  Alioto v. Cowles Communications, Inc.,  C.A. No. 52150 (ND Cal.1969);  In re Grand Jury Witnesses,   322 F. Supp. 573  (ND Cal.1970);  People v. Dohrn,  Crim. No. 69-3808 (Cook County, Ill., Cir. Ct.1970). The prevailing constitutional view of the newsman's privilege is very much rooted in the ancient role of the grand jury that has the dual function of determining if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and of protecting citizens against unfounded   criminal prosecutions. [ Footnote 23 ]  Grand jury proceedings are constitutionally mandated for the institution of federal criminal prosecutions for capital or other serious crimes, and ""its constitutional prerogatives are rooted in long centuries of Anglo-American history.""   Hannah v. Larche,   363 U. S. 420 ,   363 U. S. 489 -490 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result).  The Fifth Amendment provides that ""[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury."" [ Footnote 24 ]  The adoption of the grand jury ""in our Constitution as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases shows the high place it held as an instrument of justice.""   Costello v. United States,   350 U. S. 359 ,   350 U. S. 362  (1956).  Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the grand jury is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming   majority of the States. [ Footnote 25 ]  Because its task is to inquire into the existence of possible criminal conduct and to return only well founded indictments, its investigative powers are necessarily broad. ""It is a grand inquest, a body with powers of investigation and inquisition, the scope of whose inquiries is not to be limited narrowly by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of crime."" Blair v. United States,   250 U. S. 273 ,   250 U. S. 282  (1919).  Hence, the grand jury's authority to subpoena witnesses is not only historic,  id.  at   250 U. S. 279 -281, but essential to its task.  Although the powers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the longstanding principle that ""the public . . . has a right to every man's evidence,"" except for those persons protected by a constitutional, common law, or statutory privilege,  United States v. Bryan,  339 U.S. at   339 U. S. 331 ;  Blackmer v. United States,   284 U. S. 421 ,   284 U. S. 438  (1932); 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2192 (McNaughton rev.1961), is particularly applicable to grand jury proceedings. [ Footnote 26 ]  A number of States have provided newsmen a statutory privilege of varying breadth, [ Footnote 27 ] but the majority have not done so, and none has been provided by federal statute. [ Footnote 28 ]  Until now, the only testimonial privilege for unofficial witnesses that is rooted in the Federal Constitution   is the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.  We are asked to create another by interpreting the First Amendment to grant newsmen a testimonial privilege that other citizens do not enjoy.  This we decline to do. [ Footnote 29 ]  Fair and effective law enforcement aimed at providing security for the person and property of the individual is a fundamental function of government, and the grand jury plays an important, constitutionally mandated role in this process.  On the records now before us, we perceive no basis for holding hat the public interest in law enforcement and in ensuring effective grand jury proceedings if insufficient to override the consequential, but uncertain, burden on news gathering that is said to result from insisting that reporters, like other citizens, respond to relevant   questions put to them in the course of a valid grand jury investigation or criminal trial. This conclusion itself involves no restraint on what newspapers may publish or on the type or quality of information reporters may seek to acquire, nor does it threaten the vast bulk of confidential relationships between reporters and their sources.  Grand juries address themselves to the issues of whether crimes have been committed and who committed them.  Only where news sources themselves are implicated in crime or possess information relevant to the grand jury's task need they or the reporter be concerned about grand jury subpoenas.  Nothing before us indicates that a large number or percentage of all confidential news sources falls into either category and would in any way be deterred by our holding that the Constitution does not, as it never has, exempt the newsman from performing the citizen's normal duty of appearing and furnishing information relevant to the grand jury's task. The preference for anonymity of those confidential informants involved in actual criminal conduct is presumably a product of their desire to escape criminal prosecution, and this preference, while understandable, is hardly deserving of constitutional protection.  It would be frivolous to assert -- and no one does in these cases -- that the First Amendment, in the interest of securing news or otherwise, confers a license on either the reporter or his news sources to violate valid criminal laws.  Although stealing documents or private wiretapping could provide newsworthy information, neither reporter nor source is immune from conviction for such conduct, whatever the impact on the flow of news.  Neither is immune, on First Amendment grounds, from testifying against the other, before the grand jury or at a criminal trial.  The Amendment does not reach so far as to override the interest of the public in ensuring   that neither reporter nor source is invading the rights of other citizens through reprehensible conduct forbidden to all other persons.  To assert the contrary proposition ""is to answer it, since it involves in its very statement the contention that the freedom of the press is the freedom to do wrong with impunity and implies the right to frustrate and defeat the discharge of those governmental duties upon the performance of which the freedom of all, including that of the press, depends. . . .  It suffices to say that, however complete is the right of the press to state public things and discuss them, that right, as every other right enjoyed in human society, is subject to the restraints which separate right from wrongdoing."" Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States,   247 U. S. 402 ,   247 U. S. 419 -420 (1918). [ Footnote 30 ] Thus, we cannot seriously entertain the notion that the First Amendment protects a newsman's agreement to conceal the criminal conduct of his source, or evidence thereof, on the theory that it is better to write about crime than to do something about it.  Insofar as any reporter in these cases undertook not to reveal or testify about the crime he witnessed, his claim of privilege under the First Amendment presents no substantial question.  The crimes of news sources are no less reprehensible and threatening to the public interest when witnessed by a reporter than when they are not.  There remain those situations where a source is not engaged in criminal conduct but has information suggesting illegal conduct by others.  Newsmen frequently receive information from such sources pursuant to a tacit or express agreement to withhold the source's name and suppress any information that the source wishes not published.  Such informants presumably desire anonymity in order to avoid being entangled as a witness in a criminal trial or grand jury investigation.  They may fear that disclosure will threaten their job security or personal safety, or that it will simply result in dishonor or embarrassment. The argument that the flow of news will be diminished by compelling reporters to aid the grand jury in a criminal investigation is not irrational, nor are the records before us silent on the matter.  But we remain unclear how often and to what extent informers are actually deterred from furnishing information when newsmen are forced to testify before a grand jury.  The available data indicate that some newsmen rely a great deal on confidential sources, and that some informants are particularly sensitive to the threat of exposure, and may be silenced if it is held by this Court that, ordinarily, newsmen must testify pursuant to subpoenas, [ Footnote 31 ] but the evidence fails to demonstrate that there would be a significant constriction of the flow of news to the public if this Court reaffirms the prior common law and constitutional rule regarding the testimonial obligations of newsmen.  Estimates of the inhibiting effect of such subpoenas on the willingness of informants to make disclosures to newsmen are widely divergent and   to a great extent speculative. [ Footnote 32 ]  It would be difficult to canvass the views of the informants themselves; surveys of reporters on this topic are chiefly opinions of predicted informant behavior and must be viewed in the light of the professional self-interest of the interviewees. [ Footnote 33 ]  Reliance by the press on confidential informants does not mean that all such sources will, in fact, dry up because of the later possible appearance of the newsman before a grand jury.  The reporter may never be called, and, if he objects to testifying, the prosecution may not insist.  Also, the relationship of many informants to the press is a symbiotic one which is unlikely to be greatly inhibited by the threat of subpoena:  quite often, such informants are members of a minority political or cultural group that   relies heavily on the media to propagate its views, publicize its aims, and magnify its exposure to the public.  Moreover, grand juries characteristically conduct secret proceedings, and law enforcement officers are themselves experienced in dealing with informers, and have their own methods for protecting them without interference with the effective administration of justice.  There is little before us indicating that informants whose interest in avoiding exposure is that it may threaten job security, personal safety, or peace of mind, would in fact, be in a worse position, or would think they would be, if they risked placing their trust in public officials as well as reporters.  We doubt if the informer who prefers anonymity but is sincerely interested in furnishing evidence of crime will always or very often be deterred by the prospect of dealing with those public authorities characteristically charged with the duty to protect the public interest as well as his. Accepting the fact, however, that an undetermined number of informants not themselves implicated in crime will nevertheless, for whatever reason, refuse to talk to newsmen if they fear identification by a reporter in an official investigation, we cannot accept the argument that the public interest in possible future news about crime from undisclosed, unverified sources must take precedence over the public interest in pursuing and prosecuting those crimes reported to the press by informants and in thus deterring the commission of such crimes in the future. We note first that the privilege claimed is that of the reporter, not the informant, and that, if the authorities independently identify the informant, neither his own reluctance to testify nor the objection of the newsman would shield him from grand jury inquiry, whatever the impact on the flow of news or on his future usefulness as a secret source of information.  More important,   it is obvious that agreements to conceal information relevant to commission of crime have very little to recommend them from the standpoint of public policy.  Historically, the common law recognized a duty to raise the ""hue and cry"" and report felonies to the authorities. [ Footnote 34 ]  Misprision of a felony -- that is, the concealment of a felony ""which a man knows, but never assented to . . . [so as to become] either principal or accessory,"" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *121, was often said to be a common law crime. [ Footnote 35 ]  The first Congress passed a statute, 1 Stat. 113, § 6, as amended, 35 Stat. 1114, § 146, 62 Stat. 884, which is still in effect, defining a federal crime of misprision: ""Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be [guilty of misprision]."" 18 U.S.C. § 4. [ Footnote 36 ]     It is apparent from this statute, as well as from our history and that of England, that concealment of crime and agreements to do so are not looked upon with favor.  Such conduct deserves no encomium, and we decline now to afford it First Amendment protection by denigrating the duty of a citizen, whether reporter or informer, to respond to grand jury subpoena and answer relevant questions put to him. Of course, the press has the right to abide by its agreement not to publish all the information it has, but the right to withhold news is not equivalent to a First Amendment exemption from the ordinary duty of all other citizens to furnish relevant information to a grand jury performing an important public function.  Private restraints on the flow of information are not so favored by the First Amendment that they override all other public interests.  As Mr. Justice Black declared in another context, ""[f]reedom of the press from governmental interference under the First Amendment does not sanction repression of that freedom by private interests."" Associated Press v. United States,  326 U.S. at   326 U. S. 20 . Neither are we now convinced that a virtually impenetrable constitutional shield, beyond legislative or judicial control, should be forged to protect a private system of informers operated by the press to report on criminal conduct, a system that would be unaccountable to the public, would pose a threat to the citizen's justifiable expectations of privacy, and would equally protect well intentioned informants and those who for pay or otherwise betray their trust to their employer or associates.  The public, through its elected and appointed   law enforcement officers regularly utilizes informers, and in proper circumstances may assert a privilege against disclosing the identity of these informers.  But ""[t]he purpose of the privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement.  The privilege recognizes the obligation of citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law enforcement officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages them to perform that obligation."" Roviaro v. United States,   353 U. S. 53 ,   353 U. S. 59  (1957).  Such informers enjoy no constitutional protection.  Their testimony is available to the public when desired by grand juries or at criminal trials; their identity cannot be concealed from the defendant when it is critical to his case.   Id.  at   353 U. S. 60 -61, 62;  McCray v. Illinois,   386 U. S. 300 ,   386 U. S. 310  (1967);  Smith v. Illinois,   390 U. S. 129 ,   390 U. S. 131  (1968);  Alford v. United States,   282 U. S. 687 ,   282 U. S. 693  (1931).  Clearly, this system is not impervious to control by the judiciary and the decision whether to unmask an informer or to continue to profit by his anonymity is in public, not private, hands.  We think that it should remain there and that public authorities should retain the options of either insisting on the informer's testimony relevant to the prosecution of crime or of seeking the benefit of further information that his exposure might prevent. We are admonished that refusal to provide a First Amendment reporter's privilege will undermine the freedom of the press to collect and disseminate news.  But this is not the lesson history teaches us.  As noted previously, the common law recognized no such privilege, and the constitutional argument was not even asserted until 1958.  From the beginning of our country the press has operated without constitutional protection   for press informants, and the press has flourished.  The existing constitutional rules have not been a serious obstacle to either the development or retention of confidential news sources by the press. [ Footnote 37 ] It is said that currently press subpoenas have multiplied, [ Footnote 38 ] that mutual distrust and tension between press and officialdom have increased, that reporting styles have changed, and that there is now more need for confidential sources, particularly where the press seeks news about minority cultural and political groups or dissident organizations suspicious of the law and public officials.  These developments, even if true, are treacherous grounds for a far-reaching interpretation of the First Amendment fastening a nationwide rule on courts, grand juries, and prosecuting officials everywhere.  The obligation to testify in response to grand jury subpoenas will not threaten these sources not involved with criminal conduct and without information relevant to grand jury investigations, and we cannot hold that the Constitution places the sources in these two categories either above the law or beyond its reach. The argument for such a constitutional privilege rests heavily on those cases holding that the infringement of protected First Amendment rights must be no broader than necessary to achieve a permissible governmental purpose,  see  cases cited at   n 19,  supra.   We do not deal, however, with a governmental institution that has abused   its proper function, as a legislative committee does when it ""expose[s] for the sake of exposure.""   Watkins v. United States,   354 U. S. 178 ,   354 U. S. 200  (157).  Nothing in the record indicates that these grand juries were ""prob[ing] at will and without relation to existing need.""   DeGregory v. Attorney General of New Hampshire,   383 U. S. 825 ,   383 U. S. 829  (1966).  Nor did the grand juries attempt to invade protected First Amendment rights by forcing wholesale disclosure of names and organizational affiliations for a purpose that was not germane to the determination of whether crime has been committed,  cf. NAACP v. Alabama,   357 U. S. 449  (1958);  NAACP v. Button,   371 U. S. 415  (1963);  Bates v. Little Rock,   361 U. S. 516  (1960), and the characteristic secrecy of grand jury proceedings is a further protection against the undue invasion of such rights.   See  Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 6(e).  The investigative power of the grand jury is necessarily broad if its public responsibility is to be adequately discharged.   Costello v. United States,  350 U.S. at   350 U. S. 364 . The requirements of those cases,  see   n  18,  supra,  which hold that a State's interest must be ""compelling"" or ""paramount"" to justify even an indirect burden on First Amendment rights, are also met here.  As we have indicated, the investigation of crime by the grand jury implements a fundamental governmental role of securing the safety of the person and property of the citizen, and it appears to us that calling reporters to give testimony in the manner and for the reasons that other citizens are called ""bears a reasonable relationship to the achievement of the governmental purpose asserted as its justification.""   Bates v. Little Rock, supra,  at   361 U. S. 525 .  If the test is that the government ""convincingly show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest,""  Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee ,     372 U. S. 539 ,   372 U. S. 546  (1963), it is quite apparent (1) that the State has the necessary interest in extirpating the traffic in illegal drugs, in forestalling assassination attempts on the President, and in preventing the community from being disrupted by violent disorders endangering both persons and property; and (2) that, based on the stories Branzburg and Caldwell wrote and Pappas' admitted conduct, the grand jury called these reporters as they would others -- because it was likely that they could supply information to help the government determine whether illegal conduct had occurred and, if it had, whether there was sufficient evidence to return an indictment. Similar considerations dispose of the reporters' claims that preliminary to requiring their grand jury appearance, the State must show that a crime has been committed and that they possess relevant information not available from other sources, for only the grand jury itself can make this determination.  The role of the grand jury as an important instrument of effective law enforcement necessarily includes an investigatory function with respect to determining whether a crime has been committed and who committed it.  To this end it must call witnesses, in the manner best suited to perform its task. ""When the grand jury is performing its investigatory function into a general problem area . . . society's interest is best served by a thorough and extensive investigation."" Wood v. Georgia,   370 U. S. 375 ,   370 U. S. 392  (1962).  A grand jury investigation ""is not fully carried out until every available clue has been run down and all witnesses examined in every proper way to find if a crime has been committed."" United States v. Stone,  429 F.2d 138, 140 (CA2 1970).  Such an investigation may be triggered by tips, rumors, evidence proffered by the prosecutor, or the personal knowledge of the grand jurors.   Costello v. United States,  350 U.S. at   350 U. S. 362 .  It is   only after the grand jury has examined the evidence that a determination of whether the proceeding will result in an indictment can be made. ""It is impossible to conceive that in such cases the examination of witnesses must be stopped until a basis is laid by an indictment formally preferred, when the very object of the examination is to ascertain who shall be indicted."" Hale v. Henkel,   201 U. S. 43 ,   201 U. S. 65  (1906).   See also Hendricks v. United States,   223 U. S. 178  (1912);  Blair v. United States,  250 U.S. at   250 U. S. 282 -283.  We see no reason to hold that these reporters, any more than other citizens, should be excused from furnishing information that may help the grand jury in arriving at its initial determinations. The privilege claimed here is conditional, not absolute; given the suggested preliminary showings and compelling need, the reporter would be required to testify.  Presumably, such a rule would reduce the instances in which reporters could be required to appear, but predicting in advance when and in what circumstances they could be compelled to do so would be difficult.  Such a rule would also have implications for the issuance of compulsory process to reporters at civil and criminal trials and at legislative hearings.  If newsmen's confidential sources are as sensitive as they are claimed to be, the prospect of being unmasked whenever a judge determines the situation justifies it is hardly a satisfactory solution to the problem. [ Footnote 39 ]  For them, it would appear that only an absolute privilege would suffice.  We are unwilling to embark the judiciary on a long and difficult journey to such an uncertain destination.  The administration of a constitutional newsman's privilege   would present practical and conceptual difficulties of a high order.  Sooner or later, it would be necessary to define those categories of newsmen  who qualified for the privilege, a questionable procedure in light of the traditional doctrine that liberty of the press is the right of the lonely pamphleteer who uses carbon paper or a mimeograph just as much as of the large metropolitan publisher who utilizes the latest photocomposition methods.   Cf. In re Grand Jury Witnesses,   322 F. Supp. 573 , 574 (ND Cal.1970).  Freedom of the press is a ""fundamental personal right"" which ""is not confined to newspapers and periodicals.  It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. . . .  The press in its historic connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion."" Lovell v. Griffin,   303 U. S. 444 ,   303 U. S. 450 ,   303 U. S. 452  (138).   See also  Mills     v. Alabama,  34 U.S. 214,   34 U. S. 219  (1966);  Murdock v. Pennsylvania,   319 U. S. 105 ,   319 U. S. 111  (1943).  The informative function asserted by representatives of the organized press in the present cases is also performed by lecturers, political pollsters, novelists, academic researchers, and dramatists.  Almost any author may quite accurately assert that he is contributing to the flow of information to the public, that he relies on confidential sources of information, and that these sources will be silenced if he is forced to make disclosures before a grand jury. [ Footnote 40 ] In each instance where a reporter is subpoenaed to testify, the courts would also be embroiled in preliminary factual and legal determinations with respect to whether the proper predicate had been laid for the reporter's appearance:  Is there probable cause to believe a crime has been committed?  Is it likely that the reporter has useful information gained in confidence?  Could the grand jury obtain the information elsewhere?  Is the official interest sufficient to outweigh the claimed privilege? Thus, in the end, by considering whether enforcement of a particular law served a ""compelling"" governmental interest, the courts would be inextricably involved in   distinguishing between the value of enforcing different criminal laws.  By requiring testimony from a reporter in investigations involving some crimes but not in others, they would be making a value judgment that a legislature had declined to make, since, in each case, the criminal law involved would represent a considered legislative judgment, not constitutionally suspect, of what conduct is liable to criminal prosecution.  The task of judges, like other officials outside the legislative branch, is not to make the law, but to uphold it in accordance with their oaths. At the federal level, Congress has freedom to determine whether a statutory newsman's privilege is necessary and desirable and to fashion standards and rules as narrow or broad as deemed necessary to deal with the evil discerned and, equally important, to refashion those rules as experience from time to time may dictate.  There is also merit in leaving state legislatures free, within First Amendment limits, to fashion their own standards in light of the conditions and problems with respect to the relations between law enforcement officials and press in their own areas.  It goes without saying, of course, that we are powerless to bar state courts from responding in their own way and construing their own constitutions so as to recognize a newsman's privilege, either qualified or absolute. In addition, there is much force in the pragmatic view that the press has at its disposal powerful mechanisms of communication, and is far from helpless to protect itself from harassment or substantial harm.  Furthermore, if what the newsmen urged in these cases is true -- that law enforcement cannot hope to gain, and may suffer from subpoenaing newsmen before grand juries -- prosecutors will be loath to risk so much for so little.  Thus, at the federal level, the Attorney General has already fashioned a set of rules for federal officials in connection   with subpoenaing members of the press to testify before grand juries or at criminal trials. [ Footnote 41 ]  These rules are a major step in the direction the reporters herein desire to move.  They may prove wholly sufficient to resolve the bulk of disagreements and controversies between press and federal officials. Finally, as we have earlier indicated, news gathering is not without its First Amendment protections, and grand jury investigations, if instituted or conducted other than in good faith, would pose wholly different issues for resolution under the First Amendment. [ Footnote 42 ]  Official harassment of the press undertaken not for purposes of law enforcement, but to disrupt a reporter's relationship   with his news sources would have no justification.  Grand juries are subject to judicial control and subpoenas to motions to quash.  We do not expect courts will forget that grand juries must operate within the limits of the First Amendment as well as the Fifth. III We turn, therefore, to the disposition of the cases before us.  From what we have said, it necessarily follows that the decision in  United States v. Caldwell,  No. 70-57, must be reversed.  If there is no First Amendment privilege to refuse to answer the relevant and material questions asked during a good faith grand jury investigation, then it is  a fortiori  true that there is no privilege to refuse to appear before such a grand jury until the Government demonstrates some ""compelling need"" for a newsman's testimony.  Other issues were urged upon us, but since they were not passed upon by the Court of Appeals, we decline to address them in the first instance. The decisions in No. 70-85,  Branzburg v. Hayes  and  Branzburg v. Meigs,  must be affirmed.  Here, petitioner refused to answer question that directly related to criminal conduct that he had observed and written about.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals noted that marihuana is defined as a narcotic drug by statute, Ky.Rev.Stat. § 218.010(14) (1962), and that unlicensed possession or compounding of it is a felony punishable by both fine and imprisonment.  Ky.Rev.Stat. § 218.210 (1962).  It held that petitioner ""saw the commission of the statutory felonies of unlawful possession of marijuana and the unlawful conversion of it into hashish,"" in  Branzburg v. Pound,  461 S.W.2d  at 346.  Petitioner may be presumed to have observed similar violations of the state narcotics laws during the research he did for the story that forms the basis of the subpoena in  Branzburg v. Meigs.   In both cases, if what petitioner wrote was true,   he had direct information to provide the grand jury concerning the commission of serious crimes. The only question presented at the present time in  In re Pappas,  No. 70-94, is whether petitioner Pappas must appear before the grand jury to testify pursuant to subpoena.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court characterized the record in this case as ""meager,"" and it is not clear what petitioner will be asked by the grand jury.  It is not even clear that he will be asked to divulge information received in confidence.  We affirm the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and hold that petitioner must appear before the grand jury to answer the questions put to him, subject, of course, to the supervision of the presiding judge as to ""the propriety, purposes, and scope of the grand jury inquiry and the pertinence of the probable testimony.""  358 Mass. at 614, 266 N.E.2d  at 303-304. So ordered. [ Footnote 1 ] he article contained the following paragraph: ""'I don't know why I'm letting you do this story,' [one informant] said quietly.  'To make the narcs (narcotics detectives) mad, I guess.  That's the main reason.'  However, Larry and his partner asked for and received a promise that their names would be changed."" App. 3-4. [ Footnote 2 ] The Foreman of the grand jury reported that petitioner Branzburg had refused to answer the following two questions: ""#1. On November 12, or 13, 1969, who was the person or persons you observed in possession of Marijuana, about which you wrote an article in the Courier-Journal on November 15, 1969?"" ""#2. On November 12, or 13, 1969, who was the person or persons you observed compounding Marijuana, producing same to a compound known as Hashish?"" App. 6. [ Footnote 3 ] Judge J. Miles Pound.  The respondent in this case, Hon. John P. Hayes, is the successor of Judge Pound. [ Footnote 4 ] Ky.Rev.Stat. § 421.100 provides: ""No person shall be compelled to disclose in any legal proceeding or trial before any court, or before any grand or petit jury, or before the presiding officer of any tribunal, or his agent or agents, or before the General Assembly, or any committee thereof, or before any city or county legislative body, or any committee thereof, or elsewhere, the source of any information procured or obtained by him, and published in a newspaper or by a radio or television broadcasting station by which he is engaged or employed, or with which he is connected."" [ Footnote 5 ] Petitioner's Motion to Quash argued: ""If Mr. Branzburg were required to disclose these confidences to the Grand Jury, or any other person, he would thereby destroy the relationship of trust which he presently enjoys with those in the drug culture.  They would refuse to speak to him; they would become even more reluctant than they are now to speak to any newsman; and the news media would thereby be vitally hampered in their ability to cover that views and activities of those involved in the drug culture."" ""The inevitable effect of the subpoena issued to Mr. Branzburg, if it not be quashed by this Court, will be to suppress vital First Amendment freedoms of Mr. Branzburg, of the Courier Journal, of the news media, and of those involved in the drug culture by driving a wedge of distrust and silence between the news media and the drug culture.  This Court should not sanction a use of its process entailing so drastic an incursion upon First Amendment freedoms in the absence of compelling Commonwealth interest in requiring Mr. Branzburg's appearance before the Grand Jury.  It is insufficient merely to protect Mr. Branzburg's right to silence after he appears before the Grand Jury.  This Court should totally excuse Mr. Branzburg from responding to the subpoena and even entering the Grand Jury room.  Once Mr. Branzburg is required to go behind the closed doors of the Grand Jury room, his effectiveness as a reporter in these areas is totally destroyed.  The secrecy that surrounds Grand Jury testimony necessarily introduces uncertainties in the minds of those who fear a betrayal of their confidences."" App. 43-44. [ Footnote 6 ] After the Kentucky Court of Appeals' decision in  Branzburg v. Meigs  was announced, petitioner filed a rehearing motion in  Branzburg v. Pound  suggesting that the court had not passed upon his First Amendment argument and calling to the court's attention the recent Ninth Circuit decision in  Caldwell v. United States,  434 F.2d 1081 (1970).  On Jan. 22, 1971, the court denied petitioner's motion and filed an amended opinion in the case, adding a footnote,  461 S.W.2d 345 , 346 n. 1, to indicate that petitioner had abandoned his First Amendment argument and elected to rely wholly on Ky.Rev.Stat. § 421.100 when he filed a Supplemental Memorandum before oral argument.  In his Petition for Prohibition and Mandamus, petitioner had clearly relied on the First Amendment, and he had filed his Supplemental Memorandum in response to the State's Memorandum in Opposition to the granting of the writs.  As its title indicates, this Memorandum was complementary to petitioner's earlier Petition, and it dealt primarily with the State's construction of the phrase ""source of any information"" in Ky.Rev.Stat. § 421.100.  The passage that the Kentucky Court of Appeals cited to indicate abandonment of petitioner's First Amendment claim is as follows: ""Thus, the controversy continues as to whether a newsman's source of information should be privileged.  However, that question is not before the Court in this case.  The Legislature of Kentucky has settled the issue, having decided that a newsman's source of information is to be privileged.  Because of this, there is no point in citing Professor Wigmore and other authorities who speak against the grant of such a privilege.  The question has been many times debated, and the Legislature has spoken.  The only question before the Court is the construction of the term 'source of information' as it was intended by the Legislature."" Though the passage itself is somewhat unclear, the surrounding discussion indicates that petitioner was asserting here that the question of whether a common law privilege should be recognized was irrelevant, since the legislature had already enacted a statute.  In his earlier discussion, petitioner had analyzed certain cases in which the First Amendment argument was made, but indicated that it was not necessary to reach this question if the statutory phrase ""source of any information"" were interpreted expansively.  We do not interpret this discussion as indicating that petitioner was abandoning his First Amendment claim if the Kentucky Court of Appeals did not agree with his statutory interpretation argument, and we hold that the constitutional question in  Branzburg v. Pound  was properly preserved for review. [ Footnote 7 ] Petitioner's news films of this event were made available to the Bristol County District Attorney.  App. 4. [ Footnote 8 ] The case was reported by the superior court directly to the Supreme Judicial Court for an interlocutory ruling under Mass.Gen.Laws, c. 278, § 30A and Mass.Gen.Laws, c. 231, § 111 (1959).  The Supreme Judicial Court's decision appears at 358 Mass. 604,  266 N.E.2d 297  (1971). [ Footnote 9 ] ""We do not have before us the text of any specific questions which Pappas has refused to answer before the grand jury, or any petition to hold him for contempt for his refusal.  We have only general statements concerning (a) the inquiries of the grand jury, and (b) the materiality of the testimony sought from Pappas.  The record does not show the expected nature of his testimony or what likelihood there is of being able to obtain that testimony from persons other than news gatherers."" 358 Mass. at 606-607, 266 N.E.2d  at 299 (footnote omitted). [ Footnote 10 ] The court expressly declined to consider, however, appearances of newsmen before legislative or administrative bodies.   Id.  at 612 n. 10, 266 N.E.2d  at 303 n. 10. [ Footnote 11 ] The court noted that ""a presiding judge may consider in his discretion"" the argument that the use of newsmen as witnesses is likely to result in unnecessary or burdensome use of their work product,  id.  at 614 n. 13, 266 N.E.2d  at 304 n. 13, and cautioned that: ""We do not suggest that a general investigation of mere political or group association of persons, without substantial relation to criminal events, may not be viewed by a judge in a somewhat different manner from an investigation of particular criminal events concerning which a newsman may have knowledge."" Id.  at 614 n. 14, 266 N.E.2d  at 304 n. 14. [ Footnote 12 ] The subpoena ordered production of ""[n]otes and tape recordings of interviews covering the period from January 1, 1969, to date, reflecting statements made for publication by officers and spokesmen for the Black Panther Party concerning the aims and purposes of said organization and the activities of said organization, its officers, staff, personnel, and members, including specifically but not limited to interviews given by David Hilliard and Raymond 'Masai' Hewitt."" App. 20. [ Footnote 13 ] The New York Times was granted standing to intervene as a party on the motion to quash the subpoenas.   Application of Caldwell,   311 F. Supp. 358 , 359 (ND Cal, 1970).  It did not file an appeal from the District Court's contempt citation, and it did not seek certiorari here.  It has filed an  amicus curiae  brief, however. [ Footnote 14 ] Respondent appealed from the District Court's April 6 denial of his motion to quash on April 17, 1970, and the Government moved to dismiss that appeal on the ground that the order was interlocutory.  On May 12, 1970, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal without opinion. [ Footnote 15 ] The Government did not file a cross-appeal, and did not challenge the validity of the District Court protective order in the Court of Appeals. [ Footnote 16 ] The petition presented a single question: ""Whether a newspaper reporter who has published articles about an organization can, under the First Amendment, properly refuse to appear before a grand jury investigating possible crimes by members of that organization who have been quoted in the published articles.""

This was not always the rule at common law, however . In 17th century England, the obligations of honor among gentlemen were occasionally recognized as privileging from compulsory disclosure information obtained in exchange for a promise of confidence.

[ Footnote 22 ] ""There are few restrictions on action which could not be clothed by ingenious argument in the garb of decreased data flow.  For example, the prohibition of unauthorized entry into the White House diminishes the citizen's opportunities to gather information he might find relevant to his opinion of the way the country is being run, but that does not make entry into the White House a First Amendment right."" 381 U.S. at   381 U. S. 117 . [ Footnote 23 ] ""Historically, [the grand jury] has been regarded as a primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable function in our society of standing between the accuser and the accused . . . to determine whether a charge is founded upon reason or was dictated by an intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."" Wood v. Georgia,   370 U. S. 375 ,   370 U. S. 390  (1962) (footnote omitted). [ Footnote 24 ] It has been held that ""infamous"" punishments include confinement at hard labor,  United States v. Moreland,   258 U. S. 433  (1922); incarceration in a penitentiary,  Macking v. United States,   117 U. S. 348  (1886); and imprisonment for more than a year,  Barkman v. Sanford,  162 F.2d 592 (CA5),  cert. denied,  332 U.S. 816 (1947).  Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 7(a) has codified these holdings: ""An offense which may be punished by death shall be prosecuted by indictment.  An offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or at hard labor shall be prosecuted by indictment or, if indictment is waived, it may be prosecuted by information.  Any other offense may be prosecuted by indictment or by information."" [ Footnote 25 ] Although indictment by grand jury is not part of the due process of law guaranteed to state criminal defendants by the Fourteenth Amendment,  Hurtado v. California,   110 U. S. 516  (1884), a recent study reveals that 32 States require that certain kinds of criminal prosecutions be initiated by indictment.  Spain, The Grand Jury, Past and Present:  A Survey, 2 Am.Crim. L.Q. 119, 126-142 (1964).  In the 18 States in which the prosecutor may proceed by information, the grand jury is retained as an alternative means of invoking the criminal process and as an investigative tool.   Ibid. [ Footnote 26 ] Jeremy Bentham vividly illustrated this maxim: ""Are men of the first rank and consideration -- are men high in office -- men whose time is not less valuable to the public than to themselves -- are such men to be forced to quit their business, their functions, and what is more than all, their pleasure, at the beck of every idle or malicious adversary, to dance attendance upon every petty cause?  Yes, as far as it is necessary, they and everybody.  Were the Prince of Wales, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord High Chancellor, to be passing by in the same coach, while a chimney-sweeper and a barrow-woman were in dispute about a halfpennyworth of apples, and the chimney-sweeper or the barrowwoman were to think proper to call upon them for their evidence, could they refuse it?  No, most certainly."" 4 The Works of Jeremy Bentham 320-321 (J. Bowring ed. 1843).  In  United States v. Burr,  25 F. Cas. 30, 34 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807), Chief Justice Marshall, sitting on Circuit, opined that, in proper circumstances, a subpoena could be issued to the President of the United States. [ Footnote 27 ] Thus, far, 17 States have provided some type of statutory protection to a newsman's confidential sources: Ala.Code, Tit. 7, § 370 (1960); Alaska Stat. §09.25.150 (Supp. 1971); Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. § 12-2237 (Supp. 1971-1972); Ark.Stat.Ann. § 43-917 (1964); Cal. Evid.Code § 1070 (Supp. 1972); Ind.Ann.Stat. § 2-1733 (1968); Ky.Rev.Stat. § 421.100 (1962); La.Rev.Stat.Ann. §§ 45:1451-45:1454 (Supp. 1972); Md.Ann.Code, Art. 35, § 2 (1971); Mich.Comp.Laws § 767.5a (Supp. 1956), Mich.Stat.Ann. § 28.945(1) (1954); Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. § 93-601-2 (1964); Nev.Rev.Stat. § 49.275 (1971); N.J.Rev.Stat. §§ 2A:84A-21, 2A:84A-29 (Supp. 1972-1973); N.M.Stat.Ann. § 20-1-12.1 (1970); N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 79-h (Supp 1971-1972); Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 2739.12 (1954); Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 28, § 330 (Supp. 1972-1973). [ Footnote 28 ] Such legislation has been introduced, however.   See, e.g.,  S. 1311, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. (1971); S. 3552, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); H.R. 16328, H R. 16704, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); S. 1851, 88th Cong., 1st Sess.

For a general analysis of proposed congressional legislation,  see  Staff of Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., The Newsman's Privilege (Comm.Print 1966). [ Footnote 29 ] The creation of new testimonial privileges has been met with disfavor by commentators, since such privileges obstruct the search for truth.  Wigmore condemns such privileges as ""so many derogations from a positive general rule [that everyone is obligated to testify when properly summoned]"" and as ""obstacle[s] to the administration of justice.""  8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2192 (McNaughton rev.1961).  His criticism that "" all privileges of exemption from this duty are exceptional,  and are therefore to be discountenanced,""  id.  at § 2192, p. 73 (emphasis in original) has been frequently echoed.  Morgan, Foreword, Model Code of Evidence 22-30 (1942); 2 Z. Chafee, Government and Mass Communications 496-497 (1947); Report of ABA Committee on Improvements in the Law of Evidence, 63 A.B.A. Reports 595 (1938); C.

Securities and Exchange Commission, 87 F.2d 377, 378 (CA2 1937) (L. Hand, J.).  Neither the ALI's Model Code of Evidence (1942), the Uniform Rules of Evidence of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (1953), nor the Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates (rev. ed.1971) has included a newsman's privilege. [ Footnote 30 ] The holding in this case involved a construction of the Contempt of Court Act of 1831, 4 Stat. 487, which permitted summary trial of contempts ""so near [to the court] as to obstruct the administration of justice.""  The Court held that the Act required only that the conduct have a ""direct tendency to prevent and obstruct the discharge of judicial duty.""  247 U.S. at   247 U. S. 419 .  This view was overruled and the Act given a much narrower reading in  Nye v. United States,   313 U. S. 33 ,   313 U. S. 47 -52 (1941).   See Bloom v. Illinois,   391 U. S. 194 ,   391 U. S. 205 -206 (1968). [ Footnote 31 ] Respondent Caldwell attached a number of affidavits from prominent newsmen to his initial motion to quash, which detail the experiences of such journalists after they have been subpoenaed.  Appendix to No. 757, pp. 221. [ Footnote 32 ] Cf., e.g.,  the results of a study conducted by Guest & Stanzler, which appears as an appendix to their article,  supra,   n  20.  A number of editors of daily newspapers of varying circulation were asked the question, ""Excluding one- or two-sentence gossip items, on the average, how many stories based on information received in confidence are published in your paper each year?  Very rough estimate."" Answers varied significantly,  e.g.,  ""Virtually innumerable,"" Tucson Daily Citizen (41,969 daily circ.), ""Too many to remember,"" Los Angeles Herald-Examiner (718,221 daily circ.), ""Occasionally,"" Denver Post (252,084 daily circ.), ""Rarely,"" Cleveland Plain Dealer (370,499 daily circ.), ""Very rare, some politics,"" Oregon Journal (146,403 daily circ.).  This study did not purport to measure the extent of deterrence of informants caused by subpoenas to the press. [ Footnote 33 ] In his Press Subpoenas:  An Empirical and Legal Analysis, Study Report of the Reporters' Committee on Freedom of the Press 12, Prof. Vince Blasi discusses these methodological problems.  Prof. Blasi's survey found that slightly more than half of the 975 reporters questioned said that they relied on regular confidential sources for at least 10% of their stories.   Id.  at 21.  Of this group of reporters, only 8% were able to say with some certainty that their professional functioning had been adversely affected by the threat of subpoena; another 11% were not certain whether or not they had been adversely affected.

Brooks,  7 Wheat. 556,   20 U. S. 575  (1822) (Marshall, C.J.). [ Footnote 37 ] Though the constitutional argument for a newsman's privilege has been put forward very recently, newsmen have contended for a number of years that such a privilege was desirable.   See, e.g.,  Siebert & Ryniker, Press Winning Fight to Guard Sources, Editor & Publisher, Sept. 1, 1934, pp. 9, 36-37; G. Bird & F. Merwin, The Press and Society 592 (1971).  The first newsman's privilege statute was enacted by Maryland in 1896, and currently is codified as Md.Ann.Code, Art. 35, § 2 (1971). [ Footnote 38 ] A list of recent subpoenas to the news media is contained in the appendix to the brief of  amicus  New York Times in No. 757. [ Footnote 39 ] ""Under the case-by-case method of developing rules, it will be difficult for potential informants and reporters to predict whether testimony will be compelled, since the decision will turn on the judge's  ad hoc  assessment in different fact settings of 'importance' or 'relevance' in relation to the free press interest.  A 'general' deterrent effect is likely to result.  This type of effect stems from the vagueness of the tests and from the uncertainty attending their application.  For example, if a reporter's information goes to the 'heart of the matter' in Situation X, another reporter and informant who subsequently are in Situation Y will not know if 'heart of the matter rule X' will be extended to them, and deterrence will thereby result.  Leaving substantial discretion with judges to delineate those 'situations' in which rules of 'relevance' or 'importance' apply would therefore seem to undermine significantly the effectiveness of a reporter-informer privilege."" Note, Reporters and Their Sources:  The Constitutional Right to a Confidential Relationship, 80 Yale L.J. 317, 341 (1970). In re Grand Jury Witnesses,   322 F. Supp. 573  (ND Cal.1970), illustrates the impact of this  ad hoc  approach.  Here, the grand jury was, as in  Caldwell,  investigating the Black Panther Party, and was ""inquiring into matters which involve possible violations of Congressional acts passed to protect the person of the President (18 U.S.C. § 1751), to free him from threats (18 U.S.C. § 871), to protect our armed forces from unlawful interference (18 U.S.C. § 2387), conspiracy to commit the foregoing offenses (18 U.S.C. § 371), and related statutes prohibiting acts directed against the security of the government."" Id.  at 577.  The two witnesses, reporters for a Black Panther Party newspaper, were subpoenaed and given Fifth Amendment immunity against criminal prosecution, and they claimed a First Amendment journalist's privilege.  The District Court entered a protective order, allowing them to refuse to divulge confidential information until the Government demonstrated ""a compelling and overriding national interest in requiring the testimony of [the witnesses] which cannot be served by any alternative means.""   Id.  at 574.  The Government claimed that it had information that the witnesses had associated with persons who had conspired to perform some of the criminal acts that the grand jury was investigating.  The court held the Government had met its burden and ordered the witnesses to testify: ""The whole point of the investigation is to identify persons known to the [witnesses] who may have engaged in activities violative of the above indicated statutes, and also to ascertain the details of their alleged unlawful activities.  All questions directed to such objectives of the investigation are unquestionably relevant, and any other evaluation thereof by the Court without knowledge of the facts before the Grand Jury would clearly constitute 'undue interference of the Court.'"" Id.  at 577. Another illustration is provided by  State v. Knops,  49 Wis.2d 647,  183 N.W.2d 93  (1971), in which a grand jury was investigating the August 24, 1970, bombing of Sterling Hall on the University of Wisconsin Madison campus.  On August 26, 1970, an ""underground"" newspaper, the Madison Kaleidoscope, printed a front-page story entitled ""The Bombers Tell Why and What Next -- Exclusive to Kaleidoscope.""  An editor of the Kaleidoscope was subpoenaed, appeared, asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, was given immunity, and then pleaded that he had a First Amendment privilege against disclosing his confidential informants.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected his claim and upheld his contempt sentence: ""[Appellant] faces five very narrow and specific questions, all of which are founded on information which he himself has already volunteered.  The purpose of these questions is very clear.  The need for answers to them is 'overriding,' to say the least.  The need for these answers is nothing short of the public's need (and right) to protect itself from physical attack by apprehending the perpetrators of such attacks."" 49 Wis.2d at 658, 183 N.W.2d  at 98-99. [ Footnote 40 ] Such a privilege might be claimed by group that set up newspapers in order to engage in criminal activity and to therefore be insulated from grand jury inquiry, regardless of Fifth Amendment grants of immunity.  It might appear that such ""ham"" newspaper would be easily distinguishable, yet the First Amendment ordinarily prohibits courts from inquiring into the content of expression, except in cases of obscenity or libel, and protects speech and publication regardless of their motivation, orthodoxy, truthfulness, timeliness, or taste.   New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,  376 U.S. at   376 U. S. 269 -270;  Kingsley Pictures Corp. v. Regents,   360 U. S. 684 ,   360 U. S. 689  (1959);  Winters v. New York,   333 U. S. 507 ,   333 U. S. 510  (1948);  Thomas v. Collins,  323 U.S. at   323 U. S. 537 .  By affording a privilege to some organs of communication but not to others, court would inevitably be discriminating on the basis of content. [ Footnote 41 ] The Guidelines for Subpoenas to the News Media were first announced in a speech by the Attorney General on August 10, 1970, and then were expressed in Department of Justice Memo. No. 692 (Sept. 2, 1970), which was sent to all United States Attorneys by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division.  The Guidelines state that: ""The Department of Justice recognizes that compulsory process in some circumstances may have a limiting effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights.  In determining whether to request issuance of a subpoena to the press, the approach in every case must be to weigh that limiting effect against the public interest to be served in the fair administration of justice,"" and that: ""The Department of Justice does not consider the press 'an investigative arm of the government.'  Therefore, all reasonable attempts should be made to obtain information from non-press sources before there is any consideration of subpoenaing the press."" The Guidelines provide for negotiations with the press, and require the express authorization of the Attorney General for such subpoenas.  The principles to be applied in authorizing such subpoenas are stated to be whether there is ""sufficient reason to believe that the information sought [from the journalist] is essential to a successful investigation"" and whether the Government has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the information from alternative non-press sources.  The Guidelines provide, however, that, in ""emergencies and other unusual situations,"" subpoenas may be issued which do not exactly conform to the Guidelines. [ Footnote 42 ] Cf. Younger v. Harris,   401 U. S. 37 ,   401 U. S. 49 ,   401 U. S. 53 -54 (1971)."

 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 Syllabus   This action was brought to compel the Attorney General to grant a temporary nonimmigrant visa to a Belgian journalist and Marxian theoretician whom the American plaintiff appellees had invited to participate in academic conferences and discussions in this country.  The alien had been found ineligible for admission under §§ 212(a)(28)(D) and (G)(v) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, barring those who advocate or publish ""the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism.""  The Attorney General had declined to waive ineligibility as he has the power to do under § 212(d) of the Act, basing his decision on unscheduled activities engaged in by the alien on a previous visit to the United States, when a waiver was granted.  A three-judge District Court, although holding that the alien had no personal entry right, concluded that citizens of this country had a First Amendment right to have him enter and to hear him, and enjoined enforcement of § 212 as to this alien. Held:   In the exercise of Congress' plenary power to exclude aliens or prescribe the conditions for their entry into this country, Congress in § 212(a)(28) of the Act has delegated conditional exercise of this power to the Executive Branch. When, as in this case, the Attorney General decides for a legitimate and  bona fide  reason not to waive the statutory exclusion of an alien, courts will not look behind his decision or weigh it against the First Amendment interests of those who would personally communicate with the alien.

 Syllabus   Following hearings, the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control issued regulations prohibiting explicitly sexual live entertainment and films in bars and other establishments licensed to dispense liquor by the drink.  A three-judge District Court held the regulations invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, concluding that, under standards laid down by this Court, some of the proscribed entertainment could not be classified as obscene or lacking a communicative element. Held:   In the context not of censoring dramatic performances in a theater, but of licensing bars and nightclubs to sell liquor by the drink, the States have broad latitude under the Twenty-first Amendment to control the manner and circumstances under which liquor may be dispensed, and here the conclusion that sale of liquor by the drink and lewd or naked entertainment should not take place simultaneously in licensed establishments was not irrational, nor was the prophylactic solution unreasonable.

 Syllabus   Expulsion of student for distributing on campus a publication assertedly containing ""indecent speech"" proscribed by a bylaw of a state university's Board of Curators held an impermissible violation of her First Amendment free speech rights, since the mere dissemination of ideas on a state university campus cannot be proscribed in the name of ""conventions of decency."" Certiorari granted; 464 F.2d 136, reversed. PER CURIAM. Petitioner, a graduate student in the University of Missouri School of Journalism, was expelled for distributing on campus a newspaper ""containing forms of indecent speech"" [ Footnote 1 ] in violation of a bylaw of the Board of Curators.  The newspaper, the Free Press Underground, had been sold on this state university campus for more than four years pursuant to an authorization obtained from the University Business Office.  The particular newspaper issue in question was found to be unacceptable for two reasons.  First, on the front cover, the publishers had reproduced a political cartoon previously printed in another newspaper depicting policemen raping the Statue of Liberty and the Goddess of Justice.  The caption under the cartoon read:  "". . . With Liberty and Justice for All.""  Secondly, the issue contained an article entitled ""M___f___ Acquitted,"" which discussed the trial and acquittal on an assault   charge of a New York City youth who was a member of an organization known as ""Up Against the Wall, M___f___."" Following a hearing, the Student Conduct Committee found that petitioner had violated Par. B of Art. V of the General Standards of Student Conduct, which requires students ""to observe generally accepted standards of conduct,"" and specifically prohibits ""indecent conduct or speech."" [ Footnote 2 ]  Her expulsion, after affirmance first by the Chancellor of the University and then by its Board of Curators, was made effective in the middle of the spring semester.  Although she was then permitted to remain on campus until the end of the semester, she was not given credit for the one course in which she made a passing grade. [ Footnote 3 ] After exhausting her administrative review alternatives within the University, petitioner brought an action   for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  She claimed that her expulsion was improperly premised on activities protected by the First Amendment.  The District Court denied relief,  331 F. Supp. 1321 , and the Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting.  464 F.2d 136.  Rehearing en banc was denied by an equally divided vote of all the judges in the Eighth Circuit. The District Court's opinion rests, in part, [ Footnote 4 ] on the conclusion that the banned issue of the newspaper was obscene.  The Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to decide that question.  Instead, assuming that the newspaper was not obscene and that its distribution in the community at large would be protected by the First Amendment, the court held that, on a university campus, ""freedom of expression"" could properly be ""subordinated to other interests, such as, for example, the conventions of decency in the use and display of language and pictures.""   Id.  at 145.  The court concluded that ""[t]he Constitution does not compel the University . . . [to. allow] such publications as the one in litigation to be publicly sold or distributed on its open campus.""   Ibid. This case was decided several days before we handed down  Healy v. James,   408 U. S. 169  (1972), in which, while recognizing a state university's undoubted prerogative   to enforce reasonable rules governing student conduct, we reaffirmed that ""state colleges and universities are not enclaves immune from the sweep of the First Amendment.""   Id.  at   408 U. S. 180 .   See Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District,   393 U. S. 503  (1969).  We think  Healy  makes it clear that the mere dissemination of ideas -- no matter how offensive to good taste -- on a state university campus may not be shut off in the name alone of ""conventions of decency.""  Other recent precedents of this Court make it equally clear that neither the political cartoon nor the headline story involved in this case can be labeled as constitutionally obscene or otherwise unprotected.   E.g., Kois v. Wisconsin,   408 U. S. 229  (1972);  Gooding v. Wilson,   405 U. S. 518  (1972);  Cohen v. California,   403 U. S. 15  (1971). [ Footnote 5 ]  There is language in the opinions below which suggests that the University's action here could be viewed as an exercise of its legitimate authority to enforce reasonable regulations as to the time, place, and manner of speech and its dissemination.  While we have repeatedly approved such regulatory authority,  e.g., Healy v. James,  408 U.S. at   408 U. S. 192 -193, the facts set forth in the opinions below show clearly that petitioner was expelled because of the disapproved content of the newspaper, rather than the time, place, or manner of its distribution. [ Footnote 6 ]  Since the First Amendment leaves no room for the operation of a dual standard in the academic community with respect to the content of speech, and because the state University's.action here cannot be justified as a nondiscriminatory application of reasonable rules governing conduct, the judgments of the courts below must be reversed.  Accordingly, the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the case is remanded to the District Court, and that court is instructed to order the University to restore to petitioner any course credits she earned for the semester in question and, unless she is barred from reinstatement for valid academic reasons, to reinstate her as a student in the graduate program. Reversed and remanded. [ Footnote 1 ] This charge was contained in a letter from the University's Dean of Students, which is reprinted in the Court of Appeals' opinion.  464 F.2d 136, 139 (CA8 1972). [ Footnote 2 ] In pertinent part, the bylaw states: ""Students enrolling in the University assume an obligation and are expected by the University to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University's functions and missions as an educational institution.  For that purpose students are required to observe generally accepted standards of conduct. . . .  [I]ndecent conduct or speech . . . are examples of conduct which would contravene this standard. . . ."" 464 F.2d  at 138. [ Footnote 3 ] Miss Papish, a 32-year-old graduate student, was admitted to the graduate school of the University in September, 1963.  Five and one-half years later, when the episode under consideration occurred, she was still pursuing her graduate degree.  She was on ""academic probation"" because of ""prolonged submarginal academic progress,"" and, since November 1, 1967, she also had been on disciplinary probation for disseminating Students for a Democratic Society literature found at a university hearing to have contained ""pornographic, indecent and obscene words.""  This dissemination had occurred at a time when the University was host to high school seniors and their parents.  464 F.2d  at 139 nn. 3 and 4.  But disenchantment with Miss Papish's performance, understandable as it may have been, is no justification for denial of constitutional rights. [ Footnote 4 ] Prefatorily, the District Court held that petitioner, who was a nonresident of Missouri, was powerless to complain of her dismissal because she enjoyed no ""federally protected or other right to attend a state university of a state of which she is not a domiciled resident.""   331 F. Supp. 1321 , 1326.  The Court of Appeals, because it affirmed on a different ground, deemed it ""unnecessary to comment"" upon this rationale.  464 F.2d  at 141 n. 9.  The District Court's reasoning is directly inconsistent with a long line of controlling decisions of this Court.    See Perry v. Sindermann,   408 U. S. 593 ,   408 U. S. 596 -598 (1972), and the cases cited therein. [ Footnote 5 ] Under the authority of  Gooding  and  Cohen,  we have reversed or vacated and remanded a number of cases involving the same expletive used in this newspaper headline.   Cason v. City of Columbus,  409 U.S. 1053 (1972);  Rosenfeld v. New Jersey,   408 U. S. 901  (1972);  Lewis v. City of New Orleans,   408 U. S. 913  (1972);  Brown v. Oklahoma,   408 U. S. 914  (1972).   Cf. Keefe v. Geanakos,  418 F.2d 359, 361 and n. 7 (CA1 1969). [ Footnote 6 ] It is true, as MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST's dissent indicates, that the District Court emphasized that the newspaper was distributed near the University's memorial tower, and concluded that petitioner was engaged in ""pandering.""  The opinion makes clear, however, that the reference to ""pandering"" was addressed to the content of the newspaper and to the organization on the front page of the cartoon and the headline, rather than to the manner in which the newspaper was disseminated.  331 F. Supp.  at 1325, 1328, 1329, 1330, 1332.  As the Court of Appeals opinion states, ""[t]he facts are not in dispute.""  464 F.2d  at 138.  The charge against petitioner was quite unrelated to either the place or manner of distribution.  The Dean's charge stated that the ""forms of speech"" contained in the newspaper were ""improper on the University campus.""   Id.  at 139.  Moreover, the majority below quoted without disapproval petitioner's verified affidavit stating that ""no disruption of the University's functions occurred in connection with the distribution.""   Id.  at 139-140.  Likewise, both the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals and the District Court opinion refer to this same uncontroverted fact.   Id.  at 145; 331 F. Supp.  at 1328.  Thus, in the absence of any disruption of campus order or interference with the rights of others, the sole issue was whether a state university could proscribe this form of expression."

 Syllabus   The Democratic National Committee requested a declaratory ruling from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the Communications Act or the First Amendment precluded a licensee from having a general policy of refusing to sell time to ""responsible entities"" to present their views on public issues.  The Business Executives' Move for Vietnam Peace filed a complaint with the FCC, alleging that a broadcaster had violated the First Amendment by refusing to sell it time to broadcast spot announcements expressing the group's views on the Vietnam conflict, and that the station's coverage of anti-war views did not meet the requirements of the Fairness Doctrine.  The FCC rejected the Fairness Doctrine challenge, and ruled that a broadcaster was not prohibited from having a policy of refusing to accept paid editorial advertisements by individuals and organizations like respondents.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that ""a flat ban on paid public issue announcements is in violation of the First Amendment, at least when other sorts of paid announcements are accepted,"" and remanded the causes to the FCC to develop regulations governing which, and how many, editorial announcements would be aired. Held:   Neither the Communications Act nor the First Amendment requires broadcasters to accept paid editorial advertisements.  Pp.   412 U. S. 101 -114;   412 U.

 OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF ORANGE
 Syllabus   Appellant was convicted of mailing unsolicited sexually explicit material in violation of a California statute that approximately incorporated the obscenity test formulated in  Memoirs v. Massachusetts,   383 U. S. 413 ,   383 U. S. 418  (plurality opinion).  The trial court instructed the jury to evaluate the materials by the contemporary community standards of California.  Appellant's conviction was affirmed on appeal.  In lieu of the obscenity criteria enunciated by the  Memoirs  plurality, it is  held: 1. Obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment.   Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 , reaffirmed.  A work may be subject to state regulation where that work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex; portrays, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and, taken as a whole, does not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  Pp.   413 U. S. 23 -24. 2. The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be:  (a) whether ""the average person, applying contemporary community standards"" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,  Roth, supra,  at   354 U. S. 489 , (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  If a state obscenity law is thus limited, First Amendment values are adequately protected by ultimate independent appellate review of constitutional claims when necessary.  Pp.   413 U. S. 24 -25. 3. The test of ""utterly without redeeming social value"" articulated in  Memoirs, supra,  is rejected as a constitutional standard.  Pp.   413 U. S. 24 -25. 4. The jury may measure the essentially factual issues of prurient appeal and patent offensiveness by the standard that prevails in the forum community, and need not employ a ""national standard.""

 Syllabus   Respondents sued under Georgia civil law to enjoin the exhibiting by petitioners of two allegedly obscene films.  There was no prior restraint.  In a jury-waived trial, the trial court (which did not require ""expert"" affirmative evidence of obscenity) viewed the films and thereafter dismissed the complaints on the ground that the display of the films in commercial theaters to consenting adult audiences (reasonable precautions having been taken to exclude minors) was ""constitutionally permissible.""  The Georgia Supreme Court reversed, holding that the films constituted ""hard core"" pornography not within the protection of the First Amendment. Held: 1. Obscene material is not speech entitled to First Amendment protection.   Miller v. California, ante  p.   413 U. S. 15 ;  Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 .  P.   413 U. S. 54 . 2. The Georgia civil procedure followed here (assuming use of a constitutionally acceptable standard for determining what is unprotected by the First Amendment) comported with the standards of  Teitel Film Corp. v. Cusack,   390 U. S. 139 ;  Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51 ; and  Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown,   354 U. S. 436 .  Pp.   413 U. S. 54 -55. 3. It was not error to fail to require expert affirmative evidence of the films' obscenity, since the films (which were the best evidence of what they depicted) were themselves placed in evidence.  P.   413 U. S. 56 . 4. States have a legitimate interest in regulating commerce in obscene material and its exhibition in places of public accommodation, including ""adult"" theaters.  Pp.   413 U. S. 57 -69. (a) There is a proper state concern with safeguarding against crime and the other arguably ill effects of obscenity by prohibiting the public or commercial exhibition of obscene material.  Though conclusive proof is lacking, the States may reasonably determine that a nexus does or might exist between antisocial behavior and obscene material, just as States have acted on unprovable assumptions in other areas of public control.  Pp.   413 U. S. 57 -63. (b) Though States are free to adopt a  laissez-faire  policy toward commercialized obscenity, they are not constitutionally obliged to do so.  P.   413 U. S. 64 .  (c) Exhibition of obscene material in places of public accommodation is not protected by any constitutional doctrine of privacy.  A commercial theater cannot be equated with a private home; nor is there here a privacy right arising from a special relationship, such as marriage.   Stanley v. Georgia,   394 U. S. 557 ;  Griswold v. Connecticut,   381 U. S. 479 , distinguished.  Nor can the privacy of the home be equated with a ""one"" of ""privacy"" that follows a consumer of obscene materials wherever he goes.   United States v. Orito, post,  p.   413 U. S. 139 ;  United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, post,  p. 123.  Pp.   413 U. S. 65 -67. (d) Preventing the unlimited display of obscene material is not thought control.  Pp.   413 U. S. 67 -68.

 SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
 Syllabus   Petitioner, a proprietor of an ""adult"" bookstore, was convicted of violating a California obscenity statute by selling a plain-covered unillustrated book containing repetitively descriptive material of an explicitly sexual nature.  Both sides offered testimony as to the nature and content of the book, but there was no ""expert"" testimony that the book was ""utterly without redeeming social importance.""  The trial court used a state community standard in applying and construing the statute.  The appellate court, affirming, held that the book was not protected by the First Amendment. Held: 1. Obscene material in book form is not entitled to First Amendment protection merely because it has no pictorial content.  A State may control commerce in such a book, even distribution to consenting adults, to avoid the deleterious consequences it can reasonably conclude (conclusive proof is not required) result from the continuing circulation of obscene literature.   See Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, ante  p.   413 U. S. 49 .  Pp.   413 U. S. 118 -120. 2. Appraisal of the nature of the book by ""the contemporary community standards of the State of California"" was an adequate basis for establishing whether the book here involved was obscene.    See Miller v. California, ante,  p.   413 U. S. 15 .  P.   413 U. S. 121 . 3. When, as in this case, material is itself placed in evidence, ""expert"" state testimony as to its allegedly obscene nature, or other ancillary evidence of obscenity, is not constitutionally required.   Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra.   P.   413 U. S. 121 . 4. The case is vacated and remanded so that the state appellate court can determine whether the state obscenity statute satisfies the constitutional standards newly enunciated in  Miller, supra.

 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
 Syllabus   Appellee was charged with knowingly transporting obscene material by common carrier in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1462.  The District Court granted his motion to dismiss, holding the statute unconstitutionally overbroad for failing to distinguish between public and nonpublic transportation.  Appellee relies on  Stanley v. Georgia,   394 U. S. 557 . Held:    Congress has the power to prevent obscene material, which is not protected by the First Amendment, from entering the stream of commerce.  The zone of privacy that  Stanley  protected does not extend beyond the home.   See United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, ante  p.   413 U. S. 123 ;  Paris Adult Theatre I v.

 Syllabus   Following a complaint and hearing, respondent Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations held that petitioner had violated a city ordinance by using an advertising system in its daily newspaper whereby employment opportunities are published under headings designating job preference by sex.  On appeal from affirmance of the Commission's cease and desist order, the court below barred petitioner from referring to sex in employment headings, unless the want ads placed beneath them relate to employment opportunities not subject to the ordinance's prohibition against sex discrimination.  Petitioner contends that the ordinance contravenes its constitutional rights to freedom of the press. Held:    The Pittsburgh ordinance, as construed to forbid newspapers to carry sex-designated advertising columns for nonexempt job opportunities, does not violate petitioner's First Amendment rights.  Pp.   413 U. S. 381 -391. (a) The advertisements here, which did not implicate the newspaper's freedom of expression or its financial viability, were ""purely commercial advertising,"" which is not protected by the First Amendment.

(b) Petitioner's argument against maintaining the  Chrestensen  distinction between commercial and other speech is unpersuasive in the context of a case like this, where the regulation of the want ads was incidental to and coextensive with the regulation of employment discrimination.  Pp.   413 U. S. 387 -389. (c) The Commission's order, which was clear and no broader than necessary, is not a prior restraint endangering arguably protected speech.  Pp.   413 U.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   Some individual federal employees, an employees' union, and certain local Democratic and Republican political committees filed this action challenging as unconstitutional on its face the prohibition in § 9(a) of the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C. § 7324(a)(2), against federal employees' taking ""an active part in political management or in political campaigns.""  The section defines the phrase as ""those acts of political management or political campaigning which were prohibited on the part of employees in the competitive service before July 19, 1940, by determinations of the Civil Service Commission under the rules prescribed by the President."" The three-judge District Court recognized the ""well established governmental interest in restricting political activities by federal employees,"" but held that the statutory definition of ""political activity,"" the constitutionality of which was left open in  United Public Workers v. Mitchell,   330 U. S. 75 , was vague and overbroad, and thus unconstitutional. Held: 1. The holding of  Mitchell, supra,  that federal employees can be prevented from holding a party office, working at the polls, and acting as party paymaster for other party workers is reaffirmed.  Congress can also constitutionally forbid federal employees from engaging in plainly identifiable acts of political management and political campaigning, such as organizing a political party or club; actively participating in fund-raising activities for a partisan candidate or political party; becoming a partisan candidate for, or campaigning for, an elective public office; actively managing the campaign of a partisan candidate for public office; initiating or circulating a partisan nominating petition or soliciting votes for a partisan candidate for public office; or serving as a delegate, alternate, or proxy to a political party convention.  Pp.   413 U. S. 554 -567. 2. It is the Civil Service Commission's regulations regarding political activity, the legitimate descendants of the 1940 restatement adopted by the Congress, and, in most respects the reflection   of longstanding interpretations of the statute by the agency charged with its interpretation and enforcement, and the statute itself, that are the bases for rejecting the claim that the Act is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  Pp.   413 U. S. 568 -581. (a) The regulations specifying the various activities deemed prohibited by § 7324(a)(2) are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and observe, without sacrifice to the public interest, and are not impermissibly vague.  Pp.   413 U. S. 575 -580. (b) There is nothing fatally overbroad about the statute considered in connection with the Civil Service Commission's construction of its terms represented by the current regulations.  The restrictions on endorsements in advertisements, broadcasts, and literature, and on speaking at political party meetings in support of partisan candidates for public or party office, the major areas of difficulty, are clearly stated, are normally performed only in the context of partisan campaigns by one taking an active role in them, and are sustainable just as the other acts of political campaigning are constitutionally proscribable.  They do not, therefore, render the rest of the statute vulnerable for overbreadth.  P.   413 U. S. 580 . (c) Even if the provisions forbidding partisan campaign endorsements and speechmaking were to be considered, in some respects, constitutionally overbroad, they would not invalidate the entire statute.  Pp.   413 U. S. 580 -581. 346 F. Supp. 578 , reversed. WHITE, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and STEWART, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.

 FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
 Syllabus   Appellants, state employees charged by the Oklahoma State Personnel Board with actively engaging in partisan political activities (including the solicitation of money) among their coworkers for the benefit of their superior, in alleged violation of § 818 of the state merit system Act, brought this suit challenging the Act's validity on the grounds that two of its paragraphs are invalid because of overbreadth and vagueness.  One paragraph provides that no classified service employee ""shall directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, or in any manner be concerned in soliciting or receiving any assessment . . . or contribution for any political organization, candidacy or other political purpose."" The other provides that no such employee shall belong to ""any national, state or local committee of a political party"" or be an officer or member of a committee or a partisan political club, or a candidate for any paid public office, or take part in the management or affairs of any political party or campaign ""except to exercise his right as a citizen privately to express his opinion and . . . vote.""  The District Court upheld the provisions. Held:   Section 818 of the Oklahoma statute is not unconstitutional on its face.   CSC v. Letter Carriers, ante,  p.   413 U. S. 548 .  Pp.   413 U. S. 607 -618. (a) The statute, which gives adequate warning of what activities it proscribes and sets forth explicit standards for those who must apply it, is not impermissibly vague.  Pp.   413 U. S. 607 -608. (b) Although appellants contend that the statute reaches activities that are constitutionally protected as well as those that are not, it is clearly constitutional as applied to the conduct with which they are charged, and, because it is not substantially overbroad, they cannot challenge the statute on the ground that it might be applied unconstitutionally to others, in situations not before the Court.  Appellants' conduct falls squarely within the proscriptions of § 818, which deals with activities that the State has ample power to regulate,  United Public Workers v. Mitchell,   330 U. S. 75 ;    CSC v. Letter Carriers, supra,  and the operation of the statute has been administrative!y confined to clearly partisan political activity.  Pp.   413 U. S. 609 -618. 338 F.

 FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 Syllabus   Amendments to New York's Education and Tax Laws established three financial aid programs for nonpublic elementary and secondary schools.  The first section provides for direct money grants to ""qualifying"" nonpublic schools to be used for ""maintenance and repair"" of facilities and equipment to ensure the students' ""health, welfare and safety.""  A ""qualifying"" school is a nonpublic, nonprofit elementary or secondary school serving a high concentration of pupils from low income families.  The annual grant is $30 per pupil, or $40 if the facilities are more than 25 years old, which may not exceed 50% of the average per-pupil cost for equivalent services in the public schools.  Legislative findings concluded that the State ""has a primary responsibility to ensure the health, welfare and safety of children attending . . . nonpublic schools""; that the ""fiscal crisis in nonpublic education . . . has caused a diminution of proper maintenance and repair programs, threatening the health, welfare and safety of nonpublic school children"" in low income urban areas; and that ""a healthy and safe school environment"" contributes ""to the stability of urban neighborhoods.""  Section 2 establishes a tuition reimbursement plan for parents of children attending nonpublic elementary or secondary schools.  To qualify, a parent's annual taxable income must be less than $5,000.  The amount of reimbursement is $50 per grade school child and $100 per high school student so long as those amounts do not exceed 50% of actual tuition paid.  The legislature   found that the right to select among alternative educational systems should be available in a pluralistic society, and that any sharp decline in nonpublic school pupils would massively increase public school enrollment and costs, seriously jeopardizing quality education for all children.  Reiterating a declaration contained in the first section, the findings concluded that ""such assistance is clearly secular, neutral and nonideological.""  The third program, contained in §§ 3, 4, and 5 of the challenged law, is designed to give tax relief to parents failing to qualify for tuition reimbursement.  Each eligible taxpayer-parent is entitled to deduct a stipulated sum from his adjusted gross income for each child attending a nonpublic school.  The amount of the deduction is unrelated to the amount of tuition actually paid, and decreases as the amount of taxable income increases.  These sections are also prefaced by a series of legislative findings similar to those accompanying the previous sections.  Almost 20% of the State's students, some 700,000 to 800,000, attend nonpublic schools, approximately 85% of which are church-affiliated.  While practically all the schools entitled to receive maintenance and repair grants ""are related to the Roman Catholic Church and teach Catholic religious doctrine to some degree,"" institutions qualifying under the remainder of the statute include a substantial number of other church-affiliated schools.  The District Court held that § 1, the maintenance and repair grants, and § 2, the tuition reimbursement grants, were invalid, but that the income tax provisions of §§ 3, 4, and 5 did not violate the Establishment Clause. Held: 1. The propriety of a legislature's purpose may not immunize from further scrutiny a law that either has a primary effect that advances religion or fosters excessive church-state entanglements.  Pp.   413 U. S. 772 -774. 2. The maintenance and repair provisions of the New York statute violate the Establishment Clause because their inevitable effect is to subsidize and advance the religious mission of sectarian schools.  Those provisions do not properly guarantee the secularity of state aid by limiting the percentage of assistance to 50% of comparable aid to public schools.  Such statistical assurances fail to provide an adequate guarantee that aid will not be utilized to advance the religious activities of sectarian schools.  Pp.   413 U. S. 774 -780. 3. The tuition reimbursement grants, if given directly to sectarian schools, would similarly violate the Establishment Clause, and the fact that they are delivered to the parents, rather than the schools, does not compel a contrary result, as the effect of the aid   is unmistakably to provide financial support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions.  Pp.   413 U. S. 780 -789. (a) The fact that the grant is given as reimbursement for tuition already paid, and that the recipient is not required to spend the amount received on education, does not alter the effect of the law.  Pp.   413 U. S. 785 -787. (b) The argument that the statute provides ""a statistical guarantee of neutrality,"" since the tuition reimbursement is only 15% of the educational costs in nonpublic schools and the compulsory education laws require more than 15% of school time to be devoted to secular courses, is merely another variant of the argument rejected as to maintenance and repair costs.  Pp.   413 U. S. 787 -788. (c) The State must maintain an attitude of ""neutrality,"" neither ""advancing"" nor ""inhibiting"" religion, and it cannot, by designing a program to promote the free exercise of religion, erode the limitations of the Establishment Clause.  Pp.   413 U. S. 788 -789. 4. The system of providing income tax benefits to parents of children attending New York's nonpublic schools also violates the Establishment Clause because, like the tuition reimbursement program, it is not sufficiently restricted to assure that it will not have the impermissible effect of advancing the sectarian activities of religious schools.   Walz v. Tax Comm'n,   397 U. S. 664 , distinguished.  Pp.   413 U. S. 789 -794. 5. Because the challenged sections have the impermissible effect of advancing religion, it is not necessary to consider whether such aid would yield an entanglement with religion.  But it should be noted that, apart from any administrative entanglement of the State in particular religious programs, assistance of the sort involved here carries grave potential for entanglement in the broader sense of continuing and expanding political strife over aid to religion.

 OF OHIO FOR FRANKLIN COUNTY
 Syllabus   The Ohio Supreme Court erred in finding no constitutional infirmity in the lower Court's holding that a city ordinance punishing abuse of another by using menacing, insulting, slanderous, or profane language might constitutionally reach appellant's use of ""fighting words"" where the ordinance, as construed by the Ohio courts, is facially unconstitutional because it may be applied to punish not only unprotected, but also protected, speech.  Even though a law may be valid as applied to the conduct charged against a particular defendant, he may raise its vagueness or unconstitutional overbreadth as applied to others, and, if the law is found deficient in one of these respects, it may not be applied to him either, absent a satisfactory limiting construction. Reversed. PER CURIAM. The Court of Appeals of Franklin County, Ohio, in an unreported opinion, affirmed appellant's conviction of violating Columbus City Code § 2327.03, which provides:  ""No person shall abuse another by using menacing, insulting, slanderous, or profane language.""  The Ohio Supreme Court, in an unreported order,  sua sponte,  dismissed appellant's appeal to that court ""for the reason that no substantial constitutional question exists herein.""  We granted leave to proceed  in forma pauperis  and reverse. On December 11, 1972, we held that  Gooding v. Wilson,   405 U. S. 518  (1972), required the reversal of a previous action of the Ohio Supreme Court that dismissed an appeal from a conviction under § 2327.03.   Cason v. City of Columbus,  409 U.S. 1053.  Section 2327.03 punishes only spoken words, and, as construed by the Ohio courts, is facially unconstitutional because not limited   in application ""to punish only unprotected speech,"" but is ""susceptible of application to protected expression.""   Gooding v. Wilson, supra,  at   405 U. S. 522 .  In that circumstance, the Ohio Supreme Court erred when it found no constitutional infirmity in the holding of the Court of Appeals of Franklin County that the ordinance might constitutionally reach appellant's conduct because ""the words as used by the [appellant] are in the nature of 'fighting words,' and thereby fall within that limit of conduct proscribed by the ordinance. . . ."" For ""'[a]lthough [the ordinance] may be neither vague, overbroad, nor otherwise invalid as applied to the conduct charged against a particular defendant, he is permitted to raise its vagueness or unconstitutional overbreadth as applied to others.  And if the law is found deficient in one of these respects, it may not be applied to him either, until and unless a satisfactory limiting construction is placed on the [ordinance].  The [ordinance], in effect, is stricken down on its face. . . .'"" Id.  at   405 U. S. 521 . Reversed. THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN dissent for the reasons expressed in MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN's dissenting opinion in  Gooding v. Wilson,   405 U. S. 518 ,   405 U. S. 534  (1972), and in the dissenting statement in  Cason v. City of Columbus,  409 U.S. 1053 (1972)."

Indiana No. 73-5290 Decided November 19, 1973 414 U.S. 105 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIANA
 Syllabus   Appellant, who was arrested during an anti-war demonstration on a college campus for loudly stating, ""We'll take the fucking street later (or again),"" was subsequently convicted for violating the Indiana disorderly conduct statute.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, relying primarily on the trial court's finding that the statement ""was intended to incite further lawless action on the part of the crowd in the vicinity of appellant, and was likely to produce such action."" Held:   Appellant's language did not fall within any of the ""narrowly limited classes of speech"" that the States may punish without violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and, since the evidence showed that the words he used were not directed to any person or group and there was no evidence that they were intended and likely to produce imminent disorder, application of the statute to appellant violated his rights of free speech.   Brandenburg v. Ohio,   395 U. S. 444 .   See also Terminiello v. Chicago,   337 U. S. 1 ,   337 U. S. 4 .  ___ Ind. ___,  297 N.E.2d 413 , reversed. PER CURIAM. Gregory Hess appeals from his conviction in the Indiana courts for violating the State's disorderly conduct statute. [ Footnote 1 ]  Appellant contends that his conviction should be reversed because the statute is unconstitutionally vague,  Connally v. General Construction Co. ,  269 U.S.   385 (1926), because the statute is overbroad in that it forbids activity that is protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments,  Gooding v. Wilson,   405 U. S. 518  (1972), and because the statute, as applied here, abridged his constitutionally protected freedom of speech,  Terminiello v. Chicago,   337 U. S. 1  (1949).  These contentions were rejected in the City Court, where Hess was convicted, and in the Superior Court, which reviewed his conviction. [ Footnote 2 ]  The Supreme Court of Indiana, with one dissent, considered and rejected each of Hess' constitutional contentions, and accordingly affirmed his conviction. The events leading to Hess' conviction began with an anti-war demonstration on the campus of Indiana University.  In the course of the demonstration, approximately 100 to 150 of the demonstrators moved onto a public street and blocked the passage of vehicles.  When the demonstrators did not respond to verbal directions from the sheriff to clear the street, the sheriff and his deputies began walking up the street, and the demonstrators in their path moved to the curbs on either side, joining a large number of spectators who had gathered.  Hess was standing off the street as the sheriff passed him.    The sheriff heard Hess utter the word ""fuck"" in what he later described as a loud voice and immediately arrested him on the disorderly conduct charge.  It was later stipulated that what appellant had said was ""We'll take the fucking street later,"" or ""We'll take the fucking street again.""  Two witnesses who were in the immediate vicinity testified, apparently without contradiction, that they heard Hess' words and witnessed his arrest.  They indicated that Hess did not appear to be exhorting the crowd to go back into the street, that he was facing the crowd and not the street when he uttered the statement, that his statement did not appear to be addressed to any particular person or group, and that his tone, although loud, was no louder than that of the other people in the area. Indiana's disorderly conduct statute was applied in this case to punish only spoken words.  It hardly needs repeating that ""[t]he constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech forbid the States to punish the use of words or language not within 'narrowly limited classes of speech.'"" Gooding v. Wilson, supra,  at   405 U. S. 521 -522.  The words here did not fall within any of these ""limited classes.""  In the first place, it is clear that the Indiana court specifically abjured any suggestion that Hess' words could be punished as obscene under  Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476  (1957), and its progeny.  Indeed, after  Cohen v. California,   403 U. S. 15  (1971), such a contention with regard to the language at issue would not be tenable.  By the same token, any suggestion that Hess' speech amounted to ""fighting words,""  Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,   315 U. S. 568  (1942), could not withstand scrutiny.  Even if, under other circumstances, this language could be regarded as a personal insult, the evidence is undisputed that Hess' statement was not directed to any person or group in particular.  Although the sheriff testified that he was offended by the language,   he also stated that he did not interpret the expression as being directed personally at him, and the evidence is clear that appellant had his back to the sheriff at the time.  Thus, under our decisions, the State could not punish this speech as ""fighting words.""   Cantwell v. Connecticut,   310 U. S. 296 ,   310 U. S. 309  (1940);  Cohen v. California, supra,  at   403 U. S. 20 . In addition, there was no evidence to indicate that Hess' speech amounted to a public nuisance in that privacy interests were being invaded. ""The ability of government, consonant with the Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect others from hearing it is . . . dependent upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner."" Cohen v. California, supra,  at   403 U. S. 21 .  The prosecution made no such showing in this case. The Indiana Supreme Court placed primary reliance on the trial court's finding that Hess' statement ""was intended to incite further lawless action on the part of the crowd in the vicinity of appellant, and was likely to produce such action.""  ___ Ind. ___,  297 N.E.2d 413 , 415 (1973).  At best, however, the statement could be taken as counsel for present moderation; at worst, it amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time.  This is not sufficient to permit the State to punish Hess' speech.  Under our decisions, ""the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing  imminent  lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."" Brandenburg v. Ohio,   395 U. S. 444 ,   395 U. S. 447  (1969).  (Emphasis added.)   See also Terminiello v. Chicago,  337 U.S. at   337 U. S. 4 .  Since the uncontroverted evidence showed that Hess' statement was not directed to any person or group of persons, it   cannot be said that he was advocating, in the normal sense, any action.  And since there was no evidence, or rational inference from the import of the language, that his words were intended to produce, and likely to produce, imminent disorder, those words could not be punished by the State on the ground that they had ""a  tendency to lead to violence.'""  ___ Ind. at ___, 297 N.E.2d  at 415.
 Accordingly, the motion to proceed  in forma pauperis  is granted and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana is reversed. [ Footnote 1 ] ""Whoever shall act in a loud, boisterous or disorderly manner so as to disturb the peace and quiet of any neighborhood or family, by loud or unusual noise, or by tumultuous or offensive behavior, threatening, traducing, quarreling, challenging to fight or fighting, shall be deemed guilty of disorderly conduct, and upon conviction, shall be fined in any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars [$500] to which may be added imprisonment for not to exceed one hundred eighty [180] days."" Ind.Code 35-27-2-1 (1971), Ind.Ann.Stat. § 10-1510 (Supp. 1972). [ Footnote 2 ] The State contends that Hess failed to preserve his constitutional contentions in the state courts.  But the record demonstrates that Hess moved to quash the affidavit for disorderly conduct in the City Court on the constitutional grounds that he is asserting in this Court.  The State points out that, on appeal to the Superior Court, appellant received a trial  de novo  and did not again move to quash the affidavit in that court.  But the refusal of the City Court to quash the affidavit was asserted as error by Hess on his appeal to the Superior Court, and his memorandum in support of his appeal pressed the constitutional contentions.  Since the Supreme Court of Indiana considered and resolved each of Hess' constitutional contentions, it is apparent that it regarded Hess' actions in the state courts as sufficient under state law to preserve his constitutional arguments on appeal."

 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA
 Syllabus   The application of appellants (the Communist Party of Indiana, certain of its officers and potential voters, and its candidates for President and Vice President) for a place on the Indiana ballot for the 1972 general election was rejected for failure to submit a statutory loyalty oath stating that the Party ""does not advocate the overthrow of local, state or national government by force or violence.""  Appellants, contending that the statute was unconstitutional, thereupon filed this action in the District Court for injunctive and declaratory relief.  On September 28, 1972, a three-judge court declared the statute constitutional and ordered the Election Board to place the Party on the ballot, but only if the required oath was submitted.  After a qualified oath submitted by the Party was rejected, appellants, on October 3, sought a District Court order directing the Board to accept such oath, and, on the same day, the Board requested reconsideration of the September 28 order.  The next day, the District Court denied both motions.  On October 10, appellants filed a notice of appeal to this Court, which it later sought to withdraw so that the District Court might act on appellants' motion of the same day that the September 28 order be amended in certain respects.  On October 31, the District Court allowed withdrawal of the appeal notice, but denied the motion to amend.  Appellants refiled their notice of appeal to this Court on November 29, which appellees contend is untimely. Held: 1. Appellants' notice of appeal was within the 60-day appeal period prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 2101(b), since appellees' October 3 motion for reconsideration suspended the finality of the September 28 judgment until the District Court's denial of such motion on October 4 restored it, so that the time for appeal thus began to run from October 4.  Pp.   414 U. S. 45 -44. 2. The loyalty oath requirement of the Indiana statute violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   414 U. S. 446 -450.  (a) The principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action, applies to state regulation burdening access to the ballot, rights of association in the political party of one's choice, casting an effective ballot, and in running for office, which are interests as substantial as those in other areas that this Court has protected against statutory schemes contrary to the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   414 U. S. 448 -449. (b) For purposes of determining whether to grant a place on the ballot, a group advocating violent overthrow as abstract doctrine need not be regarded as necessarily advocating unlawful action.

 Syllabus   On remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of  Gooding v. Wilson,   405 U. S. 518 , appellant's conviction of violating a New Orleans ordinance making it unlawful ""to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward or with reference to"" a police officer while in performance of his duties was again sustained by the Louisiana Supreme Court, which did not narrow or refine the words of the ordinance, although stating that it was limited to ""fighting words"" uttered to specific persons at a specific time. Held:   The ordinance, as thus construed, is susceptible of application to protected speech, and therefore is overbroad in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and facially invalid.  The ordinance plainly has a broader sweep than the constitutional definition of ""fighting words"" as being words ""which, by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,""  Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,   315 U. S. 568 ,   315 U. S. 572 ;  Gooding v. Wilson, supra,  at   405 U.

 FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Appellee, for wearing a small United States flag sewn to the seat of his trousers, was convicted of violating the provision of the Massachusetts flag-misuse statute that subjects to criminal liability anyone who ""publicly . . . treats contemptuously the flag of the United States. . . .""  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.  The District Court in appellee's habeas corpus action found the ""treats contemptuously"" phrase of the statute unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The challenged statutory language, which had received no narrowing state court interpretation, is void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since, by failing to draw reasonably clear lines between the kinds of nonceremonial treatment of the flag that are criminal and those that are not, it does not provide adequate warning of forbidden conduct, and sets forth a standard so indefinite that police, court, and jury are free to react to nothing more than their own preferences for treatment of the flag.  Pp.   415 U. S. 572 -576,   415 U. S. 578 . 2. By challenging in state courts the vagueness of the ""treats contemptuously"" phrase as applied to him, appellee preserved his due process claim for purposes of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction,  Picard v. Connor,   404 U. S. 270 , since the challenged language is void for vagueness as applied to appellee or to anyone else.  A ""hard-core"" violator concept has little meaning with regard to the challenged language, because the phrase at issue is vague not in the sense of requiring a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible standard, but in the sense of not specifying any ascertainable standard of conduct at all.  Pp.   415 U. S. 576 -578. 3. Even if, as appellant contends, the statute could be said to deal only with ""actual"" flags of the United States, this would not resolve the central vagueness deficiency of failing to define contemptuous treatment.  Pp.   415 U. S. 578 -579.  4. That other words of the desecration and contempt portion of the statute address more specific conduct (mutilation, trampling, and defacing of the flag) does not assist appellant, since appellee was tried solely under the ""treats contemptuously"" phrase, and the highest state court in this case did not construe the challenged phrase as taking color from more specific accompanying language.  Pp.   415 U. S. 579 -50. 5. Regardless of whether restriction by that court of the scope of the challenged phrase to intentional contempt may be held against appellee, such an interpretation nevertheless does not clarify what conduct constitutes contempt of the flag, whether intentional or inadvertent.  P.   415 U. S. 580 . 471 F.2d 88, affirmed. POWELL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which DOUGLAS, BRENNAN, STEWART, and MARSHALL, JJ., joined.

 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   Appellees, prison inmates, brought this class action challenging prisoner mail censorship regulations issued by the Director of the California Department of Corrections and the ban against the use of law students and legal paraprofessionals to conduct attorney-client interviews with inmates.  The mail censorship regulations,  inter alia,  proscribed inmate correspondence that ""unduly complain[ed],"" ""magnif[ied] grievances,"" ""express[ed] inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views or beliefs,"" or contained matter deemed ""defamatory"" or ""otherwise inappropriate.""  The District Court held these regulations unconstitutional under the First Amendment, void for vagueness, and violative of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of procedural due process, and it enjoined their continued enforcement.  The court required that an inmate be notified of the rejection of correspondence, and that the author of the correspondence be allowed to protest the decision and secure review by a prison official other than the original censor.  The District Court also held that the ban against the use of law students and legal paraprofessionals to conduct attorney-client interviews with inmates abridged the right of access to the courts and enjoined its continued enforcement.  Appellants contend that the District Court should have abstained from deciding the constitutionality of the mail censorship regulations. Held: 1. The District Court did not err in refusing to abstain from deciding the constitutionality of the mail censorship regulations.  Pp. 400-404. 2. The censorship of direct personal correspondence involves incidental restrictions on the right to free speech of both prisoners and their correspondents, and is justified if the following criteria are met:  (1) it must further one or more of the important and substantial governmental interests of security, order, and the rehabilitation of inmates, and (2) it must be no greater than is necessary to further the legitimate governmental interest involved.  Pp.   416 U. S. 404 -414.  3. Under this standard, the invalidation of the mail censorship regulations by the District Court was correct.  Pp.   416 U. S. 415 -416. 4. The decision to censor or withhold delivery of a particular letter must be accompanied by minimum procedural safeguards against arbitrariness or error, and the requirements specified by the District Court were not unduly burdensome.  Pp.   416 U. S. 417 -419. 5. The ban against attorney-client interviews conducted by law students or legal paraprofessionals, which was not limited to prospective interviewers who posed some colorable threat to security or to those inmates thought to be especially dangerous and which created an arbitrary distinction between law students employed by attorneys and those associated with law school programs (against whom the ban did not operate), constituted an unjustifiable restriction on the inmates' right of access to the courts.

 Syllabus   Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1966 (the Act) provides for federal funding of special programs for educationally deprived children in both public and private schools.  Respondents, parents of children attending nonpublic schools in Kansas City, Mo., brought this class action, alleging that petitioner state school officials arbitrarily and illegally were approving Title I programs that deprived eligible nonpublic school children of services comparable to those offered eligible public school children, and seeking injunctive and other relief.  Petitioners answered that the aid sought by respondents exceeded Title I's requirements and contravened the State's Constitution and state law and public policy.  First Amendment issues were also raised.  The District Court denied relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that:  petitioners were violating the requirement of the Act and implementing regulations that educationally deprived nonpublic school children be afforded a program comparable to that provided in public schools; if ""on the premises"" special teaching services are furnished public school children, then comparable programs must be provided nonpublic school children; the state constitutional provision barring use of ""public"" school funds in private schools did not apply to Title I funds; the question whether Title I funds were ""public"" within the meaning of the State Constitution was governed by federal law; and, since no plan for ""on the premises"" instruction in nonpublic schools had yet been implemented, the court would refuse to pass on petitioners' claims that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment would be violated if Title I does require or permit such instruction. Held: 1. At this stage of the proceedings, this Court cannot reach and decide whether Title I requires the assignment of publicly employed teachers to provide remedial instruction during regular school hours on the premises of private schools attended by Title I eligible students.  Pp.   417 U. S. 415 -426. (a) While the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the District Court erred in denying relief where it clearly appeared that   petitioners had failed to comply with the Act's comparability requirement, the Court of Appeals' opinion is not to be read to the effect that petitioners must submit and approve plans that employ the use of Title I teachers on private school premises during regular school hours.  P.   417 U. S. 415 . (b) That court erred in holding that federal law governed the question whether ""on the premises"" private school instruction is permissible under Missouri law, since Title I evinces a dear intention that state constitutional spending proscriptions not be preempted as a condition of accepting federal funds.  The key issue whether federal aid is money ""donated to any state fund for public school purposes"" within the meaning of the Missouri Constitution is purely a question of state, and not federal, law, and by characterizing the problem as one involving ""federal,"" and not ""state,"" funds, and then concluding that federal law governs, the Court of Appeals in effect nullified the Act's policy of accommodating state law.  Pp.   417 U. S. 415 -419. (c) It was unnecessary for the Court of Appeals to reach the issue whether ""on the premises"" nonpublic school instruction is permissible under state law, since, in view of the fact that Title I does not obligate the State to provide such instruction, but only to provide ""comparable"" (not identical) services, the illegality of such instruction under state law would not provide a defense to respondents' charge of noncompliance with Title I.  Pp.   417 U. S. 419 -420. (d) On remand, petitioners and the local school agency have the option to provide for ""on the premises"" instruction for nonpublic school children, but if they do not choose this method or if it turns out that state law prevents its use, then the following options remain:  (1) they may approve a plan that does not utilize nonpublic school ""on the premises"" instruction but that still complies with the Act's comparability requirement; (2) they may submit a plan that eliminates ""on the premises"" instruction in public schools and may resort, instead, to other means, such as neutral sites or summer programs; or (3) they may choose not to participate at all in the Title I program.  Pp.   417 U. S. 421 -426. 2. The Court of Appeals properly declined to pass on the First Amendment issue, since no order requiring ""on the premises"" nonpublic school instruction having been entered, the matter was not ripe for review.  Pp.   417 U. S. 426 -427. 3. While, under the Act, respondents are entitled to comparable services, and therefore to relief, they are not entitled to any particular form of service, and it is the role of state and local agencies,   not of the federal courts, at least at this stage, to formulate a suitable plan.  Pp.   417 U. S. 427 -428. 475 F.2d 1338, affirmed. BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN, STEWART, POWELL, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.

 Syllabus   Four California prison inmates and three professional journalists brought this suit in the District Court challenging the constitutionality of a regulation, § 415.071, of the California Department of Corrections Manual, which provides that ""[p]ress and other media interviews with specific individual inmates will not be permitted.""  That provision was promulgated following a violent prison episode that the correction authorities attributed at least in part to the former policy of free face-to-face prisoner-press interviews, which had resulted in a relatively small number of inmates gaining disproportionate notoriety and influence among their fellow inmates.  The District Court granted the inmate appellees' motion for summary judgment, holding that § 415.071, insofar as it prohibited inmates from having face-to-face communication with journalists unconstitutionally infringed the inmates' First and Fourteenth Amendment freedoms.  The court granted a motion to dismiss with respect to the claims of the media appellants, holding that their rights were not infringed, in view of their otherwise available rights to enter state institutions and interview inmates at random and the even broader access afforded prisoners by the court's ruling with respect to the inmate appellees.  The prison officials (in No. 73-754) and the journalists (in No. 73-918) have appealed. Held: 1. In light of the alternative channels of communication that are open to the inmate appellees, § 415.071 does not constitute a violation of their rights of free speech.  Pp.   417 U. S. 821 -828. (a) A prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system, and here the restrictions on inmates' free speech rights must be balanced against the State's legitimate interest in confining prisoners   to deter crime, to protect society by quarantining criminal offenders for a period during which rehabilitative procedures can be applied, and to maintain the internal security of penal institutions.  Pp.   417 U. S. 822 -824. (b) Alternative means of communication remain open to the inmates; they can correspond by mail with persons (including media representatives),  Procunier v. Martinez,   416 U. S. 396 ; they have rights of visitation with family, clergy, attorneys, and friends of prior acquaintance; and they have unrestricted opportunity to communicate with the press or public through their prison visitors.  Pp.   417 U. S. 824 -828. 2. The rights of the media appellants under the First and Fourteenth Amendments are not infringed by § 415.071, which does not deny the press access to information available to the general public.  Newsmen, under California policy, are free to visit both maximum security and minimum security sections of California penal institutions and to speak with inmates whom they may encounter, and (unlike members of the general public) are also free to interview inmates selected at random.  ""[T]he First Amendment does not guarantee the press a constitutional right of special access to information not available to the public generally.""   Branzburg v. Hayes,   408 U. S. 665 ,   408 U.

 Syllabus   The Policy Statement of the Federal Bureau of Prisons prohibiting personal interviews between newsmen and individually designated inmates of federal medium security and maximum security prisons does not abridge the freedom of the press that the First Amendment guarantees,  Pell v. Procunier, ante  p.   417 U. S. 817 , since it ""does not deny the press access to sources of information available to members of the general public,"" but is merely a particularized application of the general rule that nobody may enter the prison and designate an inmate whom he would like to visit unless the prospective visitor is a lawyer, clergyman, relative, or friend of that inmate.

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioners were convicted of mailing and conspiring to mail an obscene advertising brochure with sexually explicit photographic material relating to their illustrated version (hereafter Illustrated Report) of an official report on obscenity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 371, and 1461.  The indictment under § 1461 charged petitioners in the language of the statute, which provides in pertinent part that obscene material and written information as to where it may be obtained is nonmailable, and that ""[w]hoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing . . . of anything declared by this section . . . to be nonmailable . . ."" commits a crime.  The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the counts charging the mailing of the allegedly obscene Illustrated Report.  Following affirmance of the convictions by the Court of Appeals, this Court decided  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , and companion cases (hereafter collectively the  Miller  cases), after considering which, the Court of Appeals denied a petition for rehearing.  Petitioners challenge their convictions based upon the pre- Miller  obscenity test in  Memoirs v. Massachusetts,   383 U. S. 413 , and also as failing to meet the standards of the  Miller  cases; and challenge various procedural and evidentiary rulings of the District Court, as well as its instructions. Held: 1. Title 18 U.S.C. § 1461, ""applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, do[es] not offend constitutional safeguards against convictions based upon protected material, or fail to give men in acting adequate notice of what is prohibited,"" Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 ,   354 U. S. 492 .  Pp.   418 U. S. 98 -99. 2. The jury's determination that the brochure was obscene was supported by the evidence, and was consistent with the  Memoirs  obscenity formulation.  P.   418 U. S. 100 . 3. The inability of the jury to reach a verdict on the counts charging distribution of the Illustrated Report had no relevance to its finding that the brochure was obscene, consistency in verdicts not being required, and the brochure being separable from the Illustrated Report.  Pp.   418 U. S. 100 -101.  4. The standards established in the  Miller  cases do not, as applied to petitioners' pre- Miller  conduct, require a reversal of their convictions.  Pp.   418 U. S. 101 -117. (a) Defendants like petitioners, who were convicted prior to the decisions in the  Miller  cases but whose convictions were on direct appeal at that time, should receive any benefit available to them from those decisions.  Pp.   418 U. S. 101 -102. (b) The instruction to the jury on the application of national community standards of obscenity was not constitutionally improper, since, in rejecting the view that the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that the proscription of obscenity be based on uniform national standards, the Court in the  Miller  cases did not require as a constitutional matter the substitution of some smaller geographical area into the same sort of formula; the test was stated in terms of the understanding of the ""average person, applying contemporary community standards.""  The Court's holding in  Miller  that California could constitutionally proscribe obscenity in terms of a ""state-wide"" standard did not mean that any such precise geographic area is required as a matter of constitutional law.  Reversal is required in pre- Miller  cases only where there is a probability that the excision of the references to the ""nation as a whole"" in the instruction dealing with community standards would have materially affected the deliberations of the jury.  Pp.   418 U. S. 103 -110. (c) Construing 18 U.S.C. § 1461 as being limited to the sort of ""patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific  hard core' sexual conduct given as examples in  Miller v. California, "" the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, it being plain that the brochure is a form of hard-core pornography well within the permissibly proscribed depictions described in  Miller.   The enumeration of specific categories of obscene material in  Miller  did not purport to proscribe, for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1461, conduct that had not previously been thought criminal, but instead added a ""clarifying gloss"" to the prior construction, making the statute's meaning ""more definite.""   Bouie v. City of Columbia.   378 U. S. 347 ,   378 U. S. 353 .  Pp.   418 U. S. 110 -116.
 (d)  Miller's  rejection of  Memoirs'  ""social value"" formulation did not mean that 18 U.S.C. § 1461 was unconstitutionally vague at the time of petitioners' convictions because it did not provide them with sufficient guidance as to the proper test of ""social value,"" that formula having been rejected not for vagueness   reasons but because it departed from  Roth's  obscenity definition and entailed a virtually impossible prosecutorial burden.  Pp.   418 U. S. 116 -117. 5. The indictment was sufficiently definite.  Pp.   418 U. S. 117 -119. (a) The language of § 1461 was not ""too vague to support conviction for crime,""  Roth v. United States, supra,  at   354 U. S. 480 .  P.   418 U. S. 117 . (b) The indictment gave petitioners adequate notice of the charges against them, since, at the time petitioners were indicted, the statutory term ""obscene,"" a legal term of art and not a generic expression, had a definite legal meaning.   Russell v. United States,   369 U. S. 749 , distinguished.  Pp.   418 U. S. 117 -119. 6. The District Court did not err in its instructions to the jury on  scienter,  including its instruction that ""[petitioners'] belief as to the obscenity or non-obscenity of the material is irrelevant,"" it being constitutionally sufficient that the prosecution show that a defendant had knowledge of the contents of materials that he distributes, and that he knew the character and nature of the materials.   Rosen v. United States,   161 U. S. 29 , followed;  Smith v. California,   361 U. S. 147 , distinguished.  Pp.   418 U. S. 119 -124. 7. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict.  P.   418 U. S. 124 . 8. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding allegedly comparable materials (materials with second-class mailing privileges, or judicially found to have been nonobscene, or available on newsstands), since,  inter alia,  expert testimony had been allowed on relevant community standards; and similar materials or judicial determinations with respect thereto do not necessarily prove nonobscenity of the materials the accused is charged with circulating; and with respect to whether proffered evidence is cumulative, clearly relevant, or confusing, the trial court has considerable latitude.  Pp.   418 U. S. 125 -127. 9. The District Court's instruction that, in deciding whether the predominant appeal of the brochure was to a prurient interest in sex, the jury could consider whether some portions appealed to a specifically defined deviant group as well as to the average person was not erroneous, since, in measuring prurient appeal, the jury (which was instructed that it must find that the material as a whole appealed generally to a prurient interest in sex) may consider the material's prurient appeal to clearly defined deviant sexual groups.   Mishkin v. New York,   383 U. S. 502 ,   383 U. S. 508 -509.  Pp.   418 U. S. 127 -130.  10. Since evidence of pandering can be relevant in determining obscenity, as long as the proper constitutional definition of obscenity is applied,  Ginzburg v. United States,   383 U. S. 463 , it was not improper for the District Court to instruct the jury in connection with the  Memoirs  test that it could also consider whether the brochure had been pandered by looking to the manner of its distribution and editorial intent.  Pp.   418 U. S. 130 -131. 11. The Court of Appeals did not err in refusing to reverse petitioners' convictions for the District Court's failure to comply with Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 30 by denying petitioners' counsel's request to make additional objections to the instructions out of the presence of the jury, since this Court's independent examination of the record confirms the Court of Appeals' view that petitioners were not prejudiced thereby.  Pp.   418 U. S. 131 -135. 12. Petitioner' argument that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance until a new jury with a presumably greater ratio of young people could be drawn -- it having been almost four years since the jury wheel had last been filled -- is without merit, since there was no showing of a discriminatory exclusion of an identifiable group entitled to a group-based protection.  Pp.   418 U. S. 135 -138. 13. The District Court's  voir dire  examination was sufficient to test the qualifications and competency of the prospective jurors, and complied with Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 24(a), and that court did not constitutionally err in not asking certain questions propounded by petitioners.  Pp.   418 U. S. 138 -140. 481 F.2d 307, affirmed. REHNQUIST, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and WHITE, BLACKMUN, and POWELL, JJ., joined.

 Syllabus   After appellant newspaper had refused to print appellee's replies to editorials critical of appellee's candidacy for state office, appellee brought suit in Florida Circuit Court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and damages, based on Florida's ""right of reply"" statute that grants a political candidate a right to equal space to answer criticism and attacks on his record by a newspaper, and making it a misdemeanor for the newspaper to fail to comply.  The Circuit Court held the statute unconstitutional as infringing on the freedom of the press, and dismissed the action.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statute did not violate constitutional guarantees, and that civil remedies, including damages, were available, and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Held: 1. The Florida Supreme Court's judgment is ""final"" under 28 U.S.C. § 1257, and thus is ripe for review by this Court.   North Dakota Pharmacy Bd. v. Snyder's Stores,   414 U. S. 156 .  Pp.   418 U. S. 246 -247. 2. The statute violates the First Amendment's guarantee of a free press.  Pp.   418 U. S. 247 -258. (a) Governmental compulsion on a newspaper to publish that which ""reason"" tells it should not be published is unconstitutional.  P.   418 U. S. 256 . (b) The statute operates as a command by a State in the same sense as a statute or regulation forbidding appellant to publish specified matter.  P.   418 U. S. 256 . (c) The statute exacts a penalty on the basis of the content of a newspaper by imposing additional printing, composing, and materials costs and by taking up space that could be devoted to other material the newspaper may have preferred to print.  Pp.   418 U. S. 256 -257 (d) Even if a newspaper would face no additional costs to comply with the statute and would not be forced to forgo publication of news or opinion by the inclusion of a reply, the statute still fails to clear the First Amendment's barriers because of its   intrusion into the function of editors in choosing what material goes into a newspaper and in deciding on the size and content of the paper and the treatment of public issues and officials.

 Syllabus   As part of its ongoing efforts to organize the remainder of letter carriers, appellant union, the carriers' collective bargaining representative in Richmond, Virginia, published a ""List of Scabs"" in its newsletter, including the names of appellees, together with a pejorative definition of ""scab"" using words like ""traitor.""  Appellees brought libel actions.  Though recognizing that the case involved the publications of a labor union that were relevant to the union's organizational campaign, the trial court overruled appellants' motions to dismiss based on the ground that the publication had First Amendment and federal labor law protection.  The court interpreted  Linn v. Plant Guard Workers,   383 U. S. 53 , to permit application of state libel laws as long as the challenged statements were made with ""actual malice,"" defined as being ""actuated by some sinister or corrupt motive such as hatred, personal spite, ill will, or desire to injure the plaintiff . . . or . . . with such gross indifference and recklessness as to amount to a wanton or willful disregard of the rights of the plaintiff."" The jury awarded appellees damages, and the State Supreme Court affirmed. Held: 1. Although  Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, supra,  held that federal labor law does not completely preempt the application of state laws to libels published during labor disputes, that decision recognized that federal law does preempt state law to the extent that the State seeks to make actionable defamatory statements in labor disputes published without knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard of the truth.  Pp.   418 U. S. 270 -273. 2. Federal labor laws favor uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in labor disputes.  Pp.   418 U. S. 273 -279. (a) The relevant law here is Executive Order No. 11491, governing labor relations in federal employment.  The basic provisions of the Executive Order are like those of the National Labor Relations Act, and similarly afford wide latitude for union freedom   of speech.  The partial preemption of  Linn  is thus equally applicable here.  Pp.   418 U. S. 273 -279. (b) The free speech protections afforded union organizing efforts extend to post-recognition organizing activity to the same degree as to pre-recognition activity.  P.   418 U. S. 279 . 3. The trial court's instruction defining malice in common law terms was erroneous and reflected a misunderstanding of  Linn,  which adopted the ""reckless or knowing falsehood"" test of  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 .  Pp.   418 U. S. 280 -282. 4. The state libel award arising out of the publication of the union newsletter here did not comport with the protection for freedom of speech in labor disputes recognized in  Linn.   The use of the epithet ""scab,"" which was literally and factually true, and is common parlance in labor disputes, was protected under federal law.  Publication of the pejorative definition was likewise not actionable, since the use of words like ""traitor"" cannot be construed as representations of fact and their use in a figurative sense to manifest the union's strong disagreement with the views of workers opposing unionization is also protected by federal law.

 FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A Chicago policeman named Nuccio was convicted of murder.  The victim's family retained petitioner, a reputable attorney, to represent them in civil litigation against Nuccio.  An article appearing in respondent's magazine alleged that Nuccio's murder trial was part of a Communist conspiracy to discredit the local police, and it falsely stated that petitioner had arranged Nuccio's ""frameup,"" implied that petitioner had a criminal record, and labeled him a ""Communist-fronter.""  Petitioner brought this diversity libel action against respondent.  After the jury returned a verdict for petitioner, the District Court decided that the standard enunciated in  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , which bars media liability for defamation of a public official absent proof that the defamatory statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, should apply to this suit.  The court concluded that that standard protects media discussion of a public issue without regard to whether the person defamed is a public official as in  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra,  or a public figure, as in  Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts,   388 U. S. 130 .  The court found that petitioner had failed to prove knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth, and therefore entered judgment  n.o.v.  for respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. A publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehoods about an individual who is neither a public official nor a public figure may not claim the  New York Times  protection against liability for defamation on the ground that the defamatory statements concern an issue of public or general interest.  Pp.   418 U. S. 339 -348. (a) Because private individuals characteristically have less effective opportunities for rebuttal than do public officials and public figures, they are more vulnerable to injury from defamation.  Because they have not voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehoods, they are also more deserving of recovery.  The state interest in compensating   injury to the reputation of private individuals is therefore greater than for public officials and public figures.  Pp.   418 U. S. 343 -345. (b) To extend the  New York Times  standard to media defamation of private persons whenever an issue of general or public interest is involved would abridge to an unacceptable degree the legitimate state interest in compensating private individuals for injury to reputation and would occasion the additional difficulty of forcing courts to decide on an  ad hoc  basis which publications and broadcasts address issues of general or public interest and which do not.  Pp.   418 U. S. 345 -346. (c) So long as they do not impose liability without fault, the States may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood which injures a private individual and whose substance makes substantial danger to reputation apparent.  Pp.   418 U. S. 347 -348. 2. The States, however, may not permit recovery of presumed or punitive damages when liability is not based on knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth, and the private defamation plaintiff who establishes liability under a less demanding standard than the  New York Times  test may recover compensation only for actual injury.  Pp.   418 U. S. 348 -350. 3. Petitioner was neither a public official nor a public figure.  Pp.   418 U. S. 351 -352. (a) Neither petitioner's past service on certain city committees nor his appearance as an attorney at the coroner's inquest into the death of the murder victim made him a public official.  P.   418 U. S. 351 . (b) Petitioner was also not a public figure.  Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community and pervasive involvement in ordering the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public figure for all aspects of his life.  Rather, the public figure question should be determined by reference to the individual's participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.  Petitioner's role in the Nuccio affair did not make him a public figure.  Pp.   418 U. S. 351 -352. 471 F.2d 801, reversed and remanded.

Washington No. 72-1690 Argued January 9, 1974 Decided June 25, 1974 418 U.S. 405 APPEAL FROM SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON
 Syllabus   For displaying out of his apartment window a United States flag upside down with a peace symbol taped thereto, appellant was convicted under Washington's ""improper use"" statute forbidding the exhibition of a United States flag to which is attached or superimposed figures, symbols, or other extraneous material.  He testified without contradiction at his trial that he thus displayed his flag as a protest against then-recent actions in Cambodia and fatal events at Kent State University, and that his purpose was to associate the American flag with peace instead of war and violence.  The Washington Supreme Court sustained the conviction, rejecting appellant's contention,  inter alia,  that the improper use statute, on its face and as applied, contravened the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Held:   The statute, as applied to appellant's activity, impermissibly infringed a form of protected expression. 81 Wash. 2d 788 ,  506 P.2d 293 , reversed. PER CURIAM. Appellant displayed a United States flag, which he owned, out of the window of his apartment.  Affixed to both surfaces of the flag was a large peace symbol fashioned of removable tape.  Appellant was convicted under a Washington statute forbidding the exhibition of a United States flag to which is attached or superimposed figures, symbols, or other extraneous material.  The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed appellant's   conviction.   81 Wash. 2d 788 ,  506 P.2d 293  (1973).  It rejected appellant's contentions that the statute under which he was charged, on its face and as applied, contravened the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, and was void for vagueness.  We noted probable Jurisdiction.  414 U.S. 815 (1973).  We reverse on the ground that, as applied to appellant's activity, the Washington statute impermissibly infringed protected expression. I On May 10, 1970, appellant, a college student, hung his United States flag from the window of his apartment on private property in Seattle, Washington.  The flag was upside down, and attached to the front and back was a peace symbol ( i.e.,  a circle enclosing a trident) made of removable black tape.  The window was above the ground floor.  The flag measured approximately three by five feet and was plainly visible to passersby.  The peace symbol occupied roughly half of the surface of the flag. Three Seattle police officers observed the flag and entered the apartment house.  They were met at the main door by appellant, who said:  ""I suppose you are here about the flag.  I didn't know there was anything wrong with it.  I will take it down.""  Appellant permitted the officers to enter his apartment, where they seized the flag and arrested him.  Appellant cooperated with the officers.  There was no disruption or altercation. Appellant was not charged under Washington's flag desecration statute.   See  Wash.Rev.Code § 9.86.030, as amended. [ Footnote 1 ]  Rather, the State relied on the so-called   ""improper use"" statute, Wash.Rev.Code § 9.86.020.  This statute provides, in pertinent part: ""No person shall, in any manner, for exhibition or display:"" ""(1) Place or cause to be placed any word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawing or advertisement of any nature upon any flag, standard, color, ensign or shield of the United States or of this state . . . or"" ""(2) Expose to public view any such flag, standard, color, ensign or shield upon which shall have been printed, painted or otherwise produced, or to which shall have been attached, appended, affixed or annexed any such word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawing or advertisement. . . . [ Footnote 2 ]"" Appellant initially was tried to the bench in a local Justice court, where he was found guilty and sentenced to 90 days' confinement, with 60 days suspended.  Appellant exercised his right to be tried  de novo  in King County Superior Court, where he received a Jury trial. The State based its case on the flag itself and the testimony of the three arresting officers, who testified that they had observed the flag displayed from appellant's window, and that on the flag was superimposed what they identified as a peace symbol.  Appellant took   the stand in his own defense.  He testified that he put a peace symbol on the flag and displayed it to public view as a protest against the invasion of Cambodia and the killings at Kent State University, events which occurred a few days prior to his arrest.  He said that his purpose was to associate the American flag with peace, instead of war and violence: ""I felt there had been so much killing and that this was not what America stood for.  I felt that the flag stood for America, and I wanted people to know that I thought America stood for peace."" Appellant further testified that he chose to fashion the peace symbol from tape so that it could be removed without damaging the flag.  The State made no effort to controvert any of appellant's testimony. The trial court instructed the jury, in essence, that the mere act of displaying the flag with the peace symbol attached, if proved beyond a reasonable doubt, was sufficient to convict.  There was no requirement of specific intent to do anything more than display the flag in that manner.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty.  The court sentenced appellant to 10 days in jail, suspended, and to a $75 fine.  The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.  5 Wash. App. 752, 490 P.2d 1321 (1971).  It held the improper use statute overbroad and invalid on its face under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  With one justice dissenting and two concurring in the result, the Washington Supreme Court reversed and reinstated the conviction.   81 Wash. 2d 788 ,  506 P.2d 293  (1973). II A number of factors are important in the instant case.  First, this was a privately owned flag.  In a technical property sense, it was not the property of any government.    We have no doubt that the State or National Governments constitutionally may forbid anyone from mishandling in any manner a flag that is public property.  But this is a different case.  Second, appellant displayed his flag on private property.  He engaged in no trespass or disorderly conduct.  Nor is this a case that might be analyzed in terms of reasonable time, place, or manner restraints on access to a public area.  Third, the record is devoid of proof of any risk of breach of the peace.  It was not appellant's purpose to incite violence or even stimulate a public demonstration.  There is no evidence that any crowd gathered or that appellant made any effort to attract attention beyond hanging the flag out of his own window.  Indeed, on the facts stipulated by the parties, there is no evidence that anyone other than the three police officers observed the flag. Fourth, the State concedes, as did the Washington Supreme Court, that appellant engaged in a form of communication. [ Footnote 3 ]  Although the stipulated facts fail to show that any member of the general public viewed the flag, the State's concession is inevitable on this record.  The undisputed facts are that appellant ""wanted people to know that I thought America stood for peace.""  To be sure, appellant did not choose to articulate his views through printed or spoken words.  It is therefore necessary to determine whether his activity was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, for as the Court noted in  United States v. O'Brien,   391 U. S. 367 ,   391 U. S. 376  (1968), ""[w]e cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea."" But the nature of   appellant's activity, combined with the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken, lead to the conclusion that he engaged in a form of protected expression. The Court for decades has recognized the communicative connotations of the use of flags.   E.g., Stromberg v. California,   283 U. S. 359  (1931).  In many of their uses, flags are a form of symbolism comprising a ""primitive but effective way of communicating ideas . . . ,"" and ""a short-cut from mind to mind.""   Board of Education v. Barnette,   319 U. S. 624 ,   319 U. S. 632  (1943).  On this record, there can be little doubt that appellant communicated through the use of symbols.  The symbolism included not only the flag, but also the superimposed peace symbol. Moreover, the context in which a symbol is used for purposes of expression is important, for the context may give meaning to the symbol.   See Tinker v. Des Moines School District,   393 U. S. 503  (1969).  In  Tinker,  the wearing of black armbands in a school environment conveyed an unmistakable message about a contemporaneous issue of intense public concern -- the Vietnam hostilities.   Id.  at   393 U. S. 505 -514.  In this case, appellant's activity was roughly simultaneous with and concededly triggered by the Cambodian incursion and the Kent State tragedy, also issues of great public moment.   Cf. Scheuer v. Rhodes,   416 U. S. 232  (1974).  A flag bearing a peace symbol and displayed upside down by a student today might be interpreted as nothing more than bizarre behavior, but it would have been difficult for the great majority of citizens to miss the drift of appellant's point at the time that he made it. It may be noted, further, that this was not an act of mindless nihilism.  Rather, it was a pointed expression of anguish by appellant about the then-current domestic and foreign affairs of his government.  An intent to   convey a particularized message was present, and in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it. We are confronted then with a case of prosecution for the expression of an idea through activity.  Moreover, the activity occurred on private property, rather than in an environment over which the State by necessity must have certain supervisory powers unrelated to expression.   Cf. Procunier v. Martinez,   416 U. S. 396  (1974);  Healy v. James,   408 U. S. 169  (1972);  Tinker v. Des Moines School District, supra.   Accordingly, we must examine with particular care the interests advanced by appellee to support its prosecution. We are met at the outset with something of an enigma in the manner in which the case was presented to us.  The Washington Supreme Court rejected any reliance on a ""breach of the peace"" rationale.  81 Wash. 2d  at 796 n. 1, 506 P.2d  at 299 n. 1.  It based its result primarily on the ground that ""the nation and state both have a recognizable interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of the nation. . . ."" [ Footnote 4 ]  Yet counsel for the State declined to support the highest state court's principal rationale in argument before us. [ Footnote 5 ]  He pursued instead the ""breach of the peace"" theory discarded by the state court.  Indeed, that was the only basis on which he chose to support the constitutionality of the state statute.  Despite counsel's approach, we think it appropriate to review briefly the range of various state interests that might be thought to support the challenged conviction, drawing upon the arguments before us, the opinions below, and the Court's opinion in  Street v. New York,   394 U. S. 576 ,   394 U. S. 590 -594 (1969).  The first interest at issue is prevention of breach of the peace.  In our view, the Washington Supreme Court correctly rejected this notion.  It is totally without support in the record. We are also unable to affirm the judgment below on the ground that the State may have desired to protect the sensibilities of passersby. ""It is firmly settled that, under our Constitution, the public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers."" Street v. New York, supra,  at   394 U. S. 592 .  Moreover, appellant did not impose his ideas upon a captive audience.  Anyone who might have been offended could easily have avoided the display.   See Cohen v. California,   403 U. S. 15  (1971).  Nor may appellant be punished for failing to show proper respect for our national emblem.   Street v. New York, supra,  at   394 U. S. 593 ;  Board of Education v. Barnette, supra.  [ Footnote 6 ] We are brought, then, to the state court's thesis that Washington has an interest in preserving the national flag as an unalloyed symbol of our country.  The court did not define this interest; it simply asserted it.   See  81 Wash. 2d  at 799, 506 P.2d  at 300.  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST's dissenting opinion today,  see post  at   418 U. S. 420 -422, adopts essentially the same approach.  Presumably, this interest might be seen as an effort to prevent the appropriation of a revered national symbol by an individual, interest group, or enterprise where there was a risk that association of the symbol with a particular   product or viewpoint might be taken erroneously as evidence of governmental endorsement. [ Footnote 7 ]  Alternatively, it might be argued that the interest asserted by the state court is based on the uniquely universal character of the national flag as a symbol.  For the great majority of us, the flag is a symbol of patriotism, of pride in the history of our country, and of the service, sacrifice, and valor of the millions of Americans who, in peace and war, have joined together to build and to defend a Nation in which self-government and personal liberty endure.  It evidences both the unity and diversity which are America.  For others, the flag carries in varying degrees a different message.  ""A person gets from a symbol the meaning he puts into it, and what is one man's comfort and inspiration is another's jest and scorn.""   Board of Education v. Barnette,  319 U.S. at   319 U. S. 632 -633.  It might be said that we all draw something from our national symbol, for it is capable of conveying simultaneously a spectrum of meanings.  If it may be destroyed or permanently disfigured, it could be argued that it will lose its capability of mirroring the sentiments of all who view it. But we need not decide in this case whether the interest   advanced by the court below is valid. [ Footnote 8 ]  We assume,  arguendo,  that it is.  The statute is nonetheless unconstitutional as applied to appellant's activity. [ Footnote 9 ]  There was no risk that appellant's acts would mislead viewers into assuming that the Government endorsed his viewpoint.  To the contrary, he was plainly and peacefully [ Footnote 10 ]   protesting the fact that it did not.  Appellant was not charged under the desecration statute,  see   n  1,  supra,  nor did he permanently disfigure the flag or destroy it.  He displayed it as a flag of his country in a way closely analogous to the manner in which flags have always been used to convey ideas.  Moreover, his message was direct, likely to be understood, and within the contours of the First Amendment.  Given the protected character of his expression, and in light of the fact that no interest the State may have in preserving the physical integrity of a privately owned flag was significantly impaired on these facts, the conviction must be invalidated.

 FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioners, a mother and her son, brought a diversity action against respondents, a newspaper publisher and a reporter, for invasion of privacy based on a feature story in the newspaper discussing the impact upon petitioners' family of the death of the father in a bridge collapse.  The story concededly contained a number of inaccuracies and false statements about the family.  The District Judge struck the claims for punitive damages for lack of evidence of malice ""within the legal definition of that term,"" but allowed the case to go to the jury on the ""false light"" theory of invasion of privacy, after instructing the jurors that liability could be imposed only if they found that the false statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, and the jury returned a verdict for compensatory damages.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Judge should have directed a verdict for respondents, since his finding of no malice in striking the punitive damages claims was based on the definition of ""actual malice"" established in  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , and thus was a determination that there was no evidence of the knowing falsity or reckless disregard of the truth required for liability. Held:   The Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the jury's verdict.  Pp.   419 U. S. 251 -254. (a) The record discloses that the District Judge, when he dismissed the punitive damages claims, was not referring to the  New York Times  ""actual malice"" standard, but to the common law standard of malice that is generally required under state tort law to support an award of punitive damages, and that, in a ""false light"" case, would focus on the defendant's attitude toward the plaintiff's privacy, and not on the truth or falsity of the material published, and thus was not determining that petitioners had failed to introduce evidence of knowing falsity or reckless disregard of the truth.  Pp.   419 U. S. 251 -252.  (b) Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to support jury findings that respondents had published knowing or reckless falsehoods about petitioners, particularly with respect to ""calculated falsehoods"" about petitioner mother's being present when the story was being prepared, and that respondent reporter's writing of the story was within the scope of his employment at the newspaper so as to render respondent publisher vicariously liable under  respondeat superior  for the knowing falsehoods in the story.

 Syllabus   Appellant reporter, employed by a television station owned by appellant broadcasting company, during a news report of a rape case, broadcast the deceased rape victim's name, which he had obtained from the indictments, which were public records available for inspection.  The victim's father, appellee, brought a damages action against appellants in reliance on a Georgia statute making it a misdemeanor to broadcast a rape victim's name, claiming that his right to privacy had been invaded by the broadcast of his daughter's name.  The trial court, rejecting appellants' claims that the broadcast was privileged under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, held that the Georgia statute gave a civil remedy to those injured by its violation and granted summary judgment for appellee.  On appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court initially held that, while the trial court erred in construing the Georgia statute to extend a cause of action for invasion of privacy, the complaint stated a cause of action for common law invasion of privacy, and that the First and Fourteenth Amendments did not, as a matter of law, require judgment for appellants.  On a motion for rehearing, appellants contended that a rape victim's name was a matter of public interest, and hence could be published with impunity, but the Supreme Court denied the motion on the ground that the statute declared a state policy that a rape victim's name was not a matter of public concern, and sustained the statute as a legitimate limitation on the First Amendment's freedom of expression. Held: 1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1257(2).  Pp.   420 U. S. 476 -487. (a) The constitutionality of the Georgia statute was ""drawn in question"" within the meaning of § 1257(2), since, when the Georgia Supreme Court relied upon it as a declaration of state public policy, the statute was drawn in question in a manner directly bearing upon the merits of the action, and the decision upholding its constitutional validity invokes this Court's appellate jurisdiction.  P.   420 U. S. 476 . (b) The Georgia Supreme Court's decision is a ""final judgment or decree"" within the meaning of § 1257.  It was plainly final on the federal issue of whether the broadcasts were privileged   under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and is not subject to further review in the state courts; and appellants would be liable for damages if the elements of the state cause of action were proved.  Moreover, since the litigation could be terminated by this Court's decision on the merits and a failure to decide the free speech question now will leave the Georgia press operating in the shadow of civil and criminal sanctions of a rule of law and statute whose constitutionality is in serious doubt, this Court's reaching the merits comports with its past pragmatic approach in determining finality.  Pp.   420 U. S. 476 -487. 2. The State may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, impose sanctions on the accurate publication of a rape victim's name obtained from judicial records that are maintained in connection with a public prosecution and that themselves are open to public inspection.  Here, under circumstances where appellant reporter based his televised report upon notes taken during court proceedings and obtained the rape victim's name from official court documents open to public inspection, the protection of freedom of the press provided by the First and Fourteenth Amendments bars Georgia from making appellants' broadcast the basis of civil liability in a cause of action for invasion of privacy that penalizes pure expression -- the content of a publication.  Pp.   420 U. S. 487 -497. (a) The commission of a crime, prosecutions resulting therefrom, and judicial proceedings arising from the prosecutions are events of legitimate concern to the public, and consequently fall within the press' responsibility to report the operations of government.  Pp.   420 U. S. 492 -493. (b) The interests of privacy fade when the information involved already appears on public record, especially when viewed in terms of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and in light of the public interest in a vigorous press.

 FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner, a promoter of theatrical productions, applied to respondents, members of a municipal board charged with managing a city auditorium and a city leased theater, to present a musical production at the theater.  Upon the basis of outside reports from which it concluded that the production would not be ""in the best interest of the community,"" respondents rejected the application.  Petitioner's subsequent motion for a preliminary injunction was denied following a hearing by the District Court, which did not review the merits of respondents' decision but concluded that petitioner had not met the burden of proving irreparable injury.  Petitioner then sought a permanent injunction permitting it to use the auditorium.  Several months later, respondents filed their first responsive pleading, and the District Court, after a three-day hearing on the content of the musical, concluded that the production contained obscene conduct not entitled to First Amendment protection, and denied injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. Respondents' denial of use of the municipal facilities for the production, which was based on the board members' judgment of the musical's content, constituted a prior restraint.   Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham,   394 U. S. 147 ;  Cantwell v. Connecticut,   310 U. S. 296 .  Pp.   420 U. S. 552 -558. 2.

S. 58 ,  viz.,  (1) the burden of instituting judicial proceedings, and of proving that the material is unprotected, must rest on the censor; (2) any restraint before judicial review can be imposed only for a specified brief period and only to preserve the  status quo;  and (3) a prompt judicial determination must be assured.  Since those safeguards in several respects were lacking here, respondents' action violated petitioner's First Amendment rights.  Pp.   420 U. S. 558 -562. 486 F.2d 894, reversed.

 Syllabus   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is authorized to provide directly to all children enrolled in nonpublic elementary and secondary schools meeting Pennsylvania's compulsory attendance requirements ""auxiliary services"" (Act 194) and loans of textbook ""acceptable for use in"" the public schools (Act 195).  Act 195 also provides for loans directly to the nonpublic schools of ""instructional materials and equipment, useful to the education"" of nonpublic school children.  The auxiliary services include counseling, testing, psychological services, speech and hearing therapy, and related services for exceptional, remedial, or educationally disadvantaged students, ""and such other secular, neutral, non-ideological service as are of benefit to nonpublic school children"" and are provided for those in public schools.  The instructional materials include periodicals, photographs, maps, charts, recordings, and films.  The instructional equipment includes projectors, recorders, and laboratory paraphernalia.  Appellants brought this suit in the District Court challenging the constitutionality of both Acts.  The court upheld the constitutionality of the textbook and instructional materials loan programs and the auxiliary services program, but invalidated the instructional equipment loan program to the extent that it sanctioned the loan of equipment ""which, from its nature, can be diverted to religious purposes."" Held:   Act 194 and all but the textbook loan provisions of Act 195 violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  Pp.   421 U.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security, pursuant to its authority under a Senate resolution to make a complete study of the administration, operation, and enforcement of the Internal Security Act of 1950, began an inquiry into the various activities of respondent organization, to determine whether they were potentially harmful to the morale of United States Armed Forces.  In connection with such inquiry, it issued a subpoena  duces tecum  to the bank where the organization had an account, ordering the bank to produce all records involving the account.  The organization and two of its members then brought an action against the Chairman, Senator Members, Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee, and the bank to enjoin implementation of the subpoena on First Amendment grounds.  The District Court dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although courts should hesitate to interfere with congressional actions even where First Amendment rights are implicated, such restraint should not preclude judicial review where no alternative avenue of relief is available, and that, if the subpoena was obeyed, respondents' First Amendment rights would be violated. Held:   The activities of the Senate Subcommittee, the individual Senators, and the Chief Counsel fall within the ""legitimate legislative sphere,"" and since it is determined that such is the case, those activities are protected by the absolute prohibition of the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution against being ""questioned in any other Place,"" and hence are immune from judicial interference.  Pp.   421 U. S. 501 -511. (a) The applicability of the Clause to private civil actions is supported by the absoluteness of the term ""shall not be questioned"" and the sweep of the term ""in any other Place.""  P.   421 U. S. 503 . (b) Issuance of subpoenas such as the one in question is a legitimate use by Congress of its power to investigate, and the subpoena power may be exercised by a committee acting, as here, on behalf of one of the Houses.  Pp.   421 U. S. 503 -505. (c) Inquiry into the sources of the funds used to carry on activities suspected by a subcommittee of Congress to have a potential   for undermining the morale of the Armed Forces is within the legitimate legislative sphere.  Pp.   421 U. S. 505 -507. (d) There is no distinction between the Subcommittee's Members and its Chief Counsel insofar as complete immunity from the issuance of the subpoena under the Speech or Debate Clause is concerned, and since the Members are immune because the issuance of the subpoena is ""essential to legislating,"" their aides share that immunity.  P.   421 U. S. 507 . (e) The subpoena cannot be held subject to judicial questioning on the alleged ground that it works an invasion of respondents' privacy, since it is ""essential to legislating.""  P.   421 U. S. 508 . (f) Nor can the subpoena be held outside the protection of speech or debate immunity on the alleged ground that the motive of the investigation was improper, since, in determining the legitimacy of a congressional action, the motives alleged to have prompted it are not to be considered.  Pp.   421 U. S. 508 -509. (g) In view of the absolute terms of the speech or debate protection, a mere allegation that First Amendment rights may be infringed by the subpoena does not warrant judicial interference.

Virginia No. 73-1309 Argued December 18, 1974 Decided June 16, 1975 421 U.S. 809 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA
 Syllabus   Appellant, the managing editor of a weekly newspaper published in Virginia, as the result of publishing a New York City organization's advertisement announcing that it would arrange low-cost placements for women with unwanted pregnancies in accredited hospitals and clinics in New York (where abortions were legal and there were no residency requirements), was convicted of violating a Virginia statute making it a misdemeanor, by the sale or circulation of any publication, to encourage or prompt the processing of an abortion.  The trial court had rejected appellant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth as being facially overbroad and as applied to appellant.  The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, also rejecting appellant's First Amendment claim and holding that the advertisement was a commercial one which could be constitutionally prohibited under the State's police power, and that, because appellant himself lacked a legitimate First Amendment interest inasmuch as his activity ""was of a purely commercial nature,"" he had no standing to challenge the statute as being facially overbroad. Held: 1. Though an intervening amendment of the statute, as a practical matter, moots the overbreadth issue for the future, the Virginia courts erred in denying appellant standing to raise that issue, since ""pure speech"", rather than conduct, was involved, and no consideration was given to whether or not the alleged overbreadth was substantial.  Pp.   421 U. S. 815 -818. 2. The statute as applied to appellant infringed constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment.  Pp.   421 U. S. 818 -829. (a) The Virginia courts erred in assuming that advertising, as such, was entitled to no First Amendment protection and that appellant had no legitimate First Amendment interest, since speech is not stripped of First Amendment protection merely because it appears in the form of a paid commercial advertisement, and the fact that the advertisement in question had commercial   aspects or reflected the advertiser's commercial interests did not negate all First Amendment guarantees.  Pp.   421 U. S. 818 -821. (b) Viewed in its entirety, the advertisement conveyed information of potential interest and value to a diverse audience consisting of not only readers possibly in need of the services offered, but also those concerned with the subject matter or the law of another State, and readers seeking reform in Virginia; and thus appellant's First Amendment interests coincided with the constitutional interests of the general public.  Pp.   421 U. S. 821 -822. (c) A State does not acquire power or supervision over another State's internal affairs merely because its own citizens' welfare and health may be affected when they travel to the other State, and while a State may seek to disseminate information so as to enable its citizens to make better informed decisions when they leave, it may not, under the guise of exercising internal police powers, bar a citizen of another State from disseminating information about an activity that is legal in that State, as the placement services here were at the time they were advertised.  Pp.   421 U. S. 822 -825. (d) Virginia's asserted interest in regulating what Virginians may  hear  or  read  about the New York services or in shielding its citizens from information about activities outside Virginia's borders (which Virginia's police powers do not reach) is entitled to little, if any, weight under the circumstances.

 Syllabus   Respondent stockholder brought this action seeking damages in favor of petitioner Bethlehem Steel Corp., a Delaware corporation, and injunctive relief because of advertisements in connection with the 1972 Presidential election that petitioner corporate directors had authorized from general corporate funds in alleged violation of 18 U.S.C. § 610, which prohibits corporations from making contributions or expenditures in connection with specified federal elections.  Respondent alleged jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and sought to state a private claim for relief under 18 U.S.C. § 610, and also invoked pendent jurisdiction for an  ultra vires  claim under Delaware law.  The District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction was upheld on appeal, following which respondent dropped the pendent claim rather than post security for expenses under state law before proceeding with that claim.  The District Court then granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the passage of the election had not mooted the case, since damages were sought, and that ""a private cause of action, whether brought by a citizen to secure injunctive relief or by a stockholder to secure injunctive or derivative damage relief [is] proper to remedy violation of § 610."" After the Court of Appeals decision Congress enacted the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 (hereinafter the Amendments), under which,  inter alia,  the Federal Election Commission can receive citizen complaints of statutory violations and, where warranted, request the Attorney General to seek injunctive action. Held: 1. The Amendments constitute an intervening law that relegates to the Commission's cognizance respondent's complaint as citizen or stockholder for injunctive relief against any alleged violations of § 610 in future elections, since this Court must examine this case according to the law existing at the time of its decision.   United States v. Schooner Peggy ,  1 Cranch 103,   5 U. S. 110 ;  Bradley v. Richmond School Board,   416 U. S. 696 ,   416 U. S. 711 .  Pp.   422 U. S. 74 -77.  2. Respondent stockholder's derivative suit with regard to the alleged 1972 violation cannot be implied under 18 U.S.C. § 610, and respondent's remedy, if any, must be under Delaware's corporation law.  Pp.   422 U. S. 77 -85. (a) Section 610 was primarily concerned not with the internal relations between corporations and stockholders, but with corporations as a source of aggregated wealth, and therefore of potential corrupting influence; thus, this statute differs from other criminal statutes in which private causes of action have been inferred because of a clearly articulated federal right in the plaintiff,  e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents,   403 U. S. 388 , or a pervasive legislative scheme governing the relationship between the plaintiff class and the defendant class in a particular regard,  e.g., J. I. Case Co. v. Borak,   377 U. S. 426 .  Pp.   422 U. S. 78 -82. (b) The legislative history of § 610 suggests no congressional intention to vest in corporate shareholders a federal right to damages for a violation of the statute.  Pp.   422 U. S. 82 -84. (c) A private remedy would not further the statutory purpose of dulling corporate influence on federal elections, since any compelled repayment to the corporation might well not deter the initial violation.  P.   422 U. S. 84 . (d) The cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law in an area of primarily state concern.  In addition to the  ultra vires  claim urged by respondent the alleged misuse of corporate funds might, under the law of some States, give rise to a cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty.  Pp.   422 U. S. 84 -85. 496 F.2d 416, reversed. BRENNAN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. "

 OF FLORIDA, FIRST DISTRICT
 Syllabus   A Jacksonville, Fla., ordinance making it a public nuisance and a punishable offense for a drive-in movie theater to exhibit films containing nudity, when the screen is visible from a public street or place, held facially invalid as an infringement of First Amendment rights.  Pp.   422 U. S. 208 -217. (a) The ordinance, by discriminating among movies solely on the basis of content, has the effect of deterring drive-in theaters from showing movies containing any nudity, however innocent or even educational, and such censorship of the content of otherwise protected speech cannot be justified on the basis of the limited privacy interest of persons on the public streets, who, if offended by viewing the movies, can readily avert their eyes.  Pp.   422 U. S. 208 -212. (b) Nor can the ordinance be justified as an exercise of the city's police power for the protection of children against viewing the films.  Even assuming that such is its purpose, the restriction is broader than permissible. since it is not directed against sexually explicit nudity or otherwise limited.  Pp.   422 U. S. 212 -214. (c) Nor can the ordinance be justified as a traffic regulation.  If this were its purpose, it would be invalid as a strikingly underinclusive legislative classification, since it singles out movies containing nudity from all other movies that might distract a passing motorist.  Pp.   422 U. S. 214 -215. (d) The possibility of a narrowing construction of the ordinance appears remote, particularly where appellee city offered several distinct justifications for it in its broadest terms.  Moreover, its deterrent effect on legitimate expression in the form of movies is both real and substantial.  Pp.   422 U. S. 215 -217. 288 So. 2d 260, reversed.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (Act), as amended in 1974, (a) limits political contributions to candidates for federal elective office by an individual or a group to $1,000 and by a political committee to $5,000 to any single candidate per election, with an over-all annual limitation of $25,000 by an individual contributor; (b) limits expenditures by individuals or groups ""relative to a clearly identified candidate"" to $1,000 per candidate per election, and by a candidate from his personal or family funds to various specified annual amounts depending upon the federal office sought, and restricts over-all general election and primary campaign expenditures by candidates to various specified amounts, again depending upon the federal office sought; (c) requires political committees to keep detailed records of contributions and expenditures, including the name and address of each individual contributing in excess of $10, and his occupation and   principal place of business if his contribution exceeds $100, and to file quarterly reports with the Federal Election Commission disclosing the source of every contribution exceeding $100 and the recipient and purpose of every expenditure over $100, and also requires every individual or group, other than a candidate or political committee, making contributions or expenditures exceeding $100 ""other than by contribution to a political committee or candidate"" to file a statement with the Commission; and (d) creates the eight-member Commission as the administering agency with recordkeeping, disclosure, and investigatory functions and extensive rulemaking, adjudicatory, and enforcement powers, and consisting of two members appointed by the President  pro tempore  of the Senate, two by the Speaker of the House, and two by the President (all subject to confirmation by both Houses of Congress), and the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House as  ex officio  nonvoting members.  Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC), as amended in 1974, provides for public financing of Presidential nominating conventions and general election and primary campaigns from general revenues and allocates such funding to conventions and general election campaigns by establishing three categories:  (1) ""major"" parties (those whose candidate received 25% or more of the vote in the most recent election), which receive full funding; (2) ""minor"" parties (those whose candidate received at least 5% but less than 25% of the votes at the last election), which receive only a percentage of the funds to which the major parties are entitled; and (3) ""new"" parties (all other parties), which are limited to receipt of post-election funds or are not entitled to any funds if their candidate receives less than 5% of the vote.  A primary candidate for the Presidential nomination by a political party who receives more than $5,000 from private sources (counting only the first $250 of each contribution) in each of at least 20 States is eligible for matching public funds.  Appellants (various federal officeholders and candidates, supporting political organizations, and others) brought suit against appellees (the Secretary of the Senate, Clerk of the House, Comptroller General, Attorney General, and the Commission) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the above statutory provisions on various constitutional grounds.  The Court of Appeals, on certified questions from the District Court, upheld all but one of the statutory provisions.  A three-judge District Court upheld the constitutionality of Subtitle H. Held:   1. This litigation presents an Art. III ""case or controversy,"" since the complaint discloses that at least some of the appellants have a sufficient ""personal stake"" in a determination of the constitutional validity of each of the challenged provisions to present ""a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts."" Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,   300 U. S. 227 ,   300 U. S. 241 .  Pp.   424 U. S. 11 -12 2. The Act's contribution provisions are constitutional, but the expenditure provisions violate the First Amendment.  Pp.   424 U. S. 12 -59. (a) The contribution provisions, along with those covering disclosure, are appropriate legislative weapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence stemming from the dependence of candidates on large campaign contributions, and the ceilings imposed accordingly serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion.  Pp.   424 U. S. 23 -38. (b) The First Amendment requires the invalidation of the Act's independent expenditure ceiling, its limitation on a candidate's expenditures from his own personal funds, and its ceilings on over-all campaign expenditures, since those provisions place substantial and direct restrictions on the ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions that the First Amendment cannot tolerate.  Pp.   424 U. S. 39 -59. 3. The Act's disclosure and recordkeeping provisions are constitutional.  Pp.   424 U. S. 60 -84. (a) The general disclosure provisions, which serve substantial governmental interests in informing the electorate and preventing the corruption of the political process, are not overbroad insofar as they apply to contributions to minor parties and independent candidates.  No blanket exemption for minor parties is warranted, since such parties, in order to prove injury as a result of application to them of the disclosure provisions, need show only a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of a party's contributors' names will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals in violation of their First Amendment associational rights.  Pp.   424 U. S. 64 -74. (b) The provision for disclosure by those who make independent   contributions and expenditures, as narrowly construed to apply only (1) when they make contributions earmarked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent to some person other than a candidate or political committee and (2) when they make an expenditure for a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate is not unconstitutionally vague and does not constitute a prior restraint, but is a reasonable and minimally restrictive method of furthering First Amendment values by public exposure of the federal election system.  Pp.   424 U. S. 74 -82. (c) The extension of the recordkeeping provisions to contributions as small as those just above $10 and the disclosure provisions to contributions above $100 is not, on this record, overbroad, since it cannot be said to be unrelated to the informational and enforcement goals of the legislation.  Pp.   424 U. S. 82 -84. 4. Subtitle H of the IRC is constitutional.  Pp.   424 U. S. 85 -109. (a) Subtitle H is not invalid under the General Welfare Clause but, as a means to reform the electoral process, was clearly a choice within the power granted to Congress by the Clause to decide which expenditures will promote the general welfare.  Pp.   424 U. S. 90 -92. (b) Nor does Subtitle H violate the First Amendment.  Rather than abridging, restricting, or censoring speech, it represents an effort to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process.  Pp.   424 U. S. 92 -93. (c) Subtitle H, being less burdensome than ballot access regulations and having been enacted in furtherance of vital governmental interests in relieving major party candidates from the rigors of soliciting private contributions, in not funding candidates who lack significant public support, and in eliminating reliance on large private contributions for funding of conventions and campaigns, does not invidiously discriminate against minor and new parties in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   424 U. S. 93 -108. (d) Invalidation of the spending limit provisions of the Act does not render Subtitle H unconstitutional, but the Subtitle is severable from such provisions, and is not dependent upon the existence of a generally applicable expenditure limit.  Pp.   424 U. S. 108 -109. 5. The Commission's composition as to all but its investigative and informative powers violates Art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  With respect to the Commission's powers, all of which are ripe for review,   to enforce the Act, including primary responsibility for bringing civil actions against violators, to make rules for carrying out the Act, to temporarily disqualify federal candidates for failing to file required reports, and to authorize convention expenditures in excess of the specified limits, the provisions of the Act vesting such powers in the Commission and the prescribed method of appointment of members of the Commission to the extent that a majority of the voting members are appointed by the President  pro tempore  of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, violate the Appointments Clause, which provides, in pertinent part, that the President shall nominate, and, with the Senate's advice and consent, appoint, all ""Officers of the United States,"" whose appointments are not otherwise provided for, but that Congress may vest the appointment of such inferior officers as it deems proper in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments.  Hence (though the Commission's past acts are accorded  de facto  validity and a stay is granted permitting it to function under the Act for not more than 30 days), the Commission, as presently constituted, may not, because of that Clause, exercise such powers, which can be exercised only by ""Officers of the United States"" appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause, although it may exercise such investigative and informative powers as are in the same category as those powers that Congress might delegate to one of its own committees.

PER CURIAM. These appeals present constitutional challenges to the key provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (Act), and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, all as amended in 1974. [ Footnote 1 ]  The Court of Appeals, in sustaining the legislation in large part against various constitutional challenges, [ Footnote 2 ] viewed it as ""by far the most comprehensive reform legislation [ever] passed by Congress concerning the election of the President, Vice-President, and members of Congress.""  171 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 182, 519 F.2d 821, 831 (1975).  The statutes at issue, summarized in broad terms, contain the following provisions:  (a) individual political contributions are limited to $1,000 to any single candidate per election, with an over-all annual limitation of $25,000 by any contributor; independent expenditures by individuals and groups ""relative to a clearly identified candidate"" are limited to $1,000 a year; campaign spending by candidates for various federal offices and spending for national conventions by political parties are subject to prescribed limits; (b) contributions and expenditures above certain threshold levels must be reported and publicly disclosed; (c) a system for public funding of Presidential campaign activities is established by Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code; [ Footnote 3 ] and (d) a Federal Election Commission is established to administer and enforce the legislation. This suit was originally filed by appellants in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Plaintiffs included a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, a United States Senator who is a candidate for reelection, a potential contributor, the   Committee for a Constitutional Presidency -- McCarthy '76, the Conservative Party of the State of New York, the Mississippi Republican Party, the Libertarian Party, the New York Civil Liberties Union, Inc., the American Conservative Union, the Conservative Victory Fund, and Human Events, Inc.  The defendants included the Secretary of the United States Senate and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, both in their official capacities and as  ex officio  members of the Federal Election Commission.  The Commission itself was named as a defendant.  Also named were the Attorney General of the United States and the Comptroller General of the United States. Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2201, and 2202, and § 315(a) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. § 437h(a) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). [ Footnote 4 ]  The complaint sought both a   declaratory judgment that the major provisions of the Act were unconstitutional and an injunction against enforcement of those provisions.  Appellants requested the convocation of a three-judge District Court as to all matters and also requested certification of constitutional questions to the Court of Appeals, pursuant to the terms of § 315(a).  The District Judge denied the application for a three-judge court and directed that the case be transmitted to the Court of Appeals.  That court entered an order stating that the case was ""preliminarily deemed"" to be properly certified under § 315(a).  Leave to intervene was granted to various groups and individuals. [ Footnote 5 ]  After considering matters regarding factfinding procedures, the Court of Appeals entered an order en banc remanding the case to the District Court to (1) identify the constitutional issues in the complaint; (2) take whatever evidence was found necessary in addition to the submissions suitably dealt with by way of judicial notice; (3) make findings of fact with reference to those issues; and (4) certify the constitutional questions arising from the foregoing steps to the Court of Appeals. [ Footnote 6 ]  On remand, the District   Judge entered a memorandum order adopting extensive findings of fact and transmitting the augmented record back to the Court of Appeals. On plenary review, a majority of the Court of Appeals rejected, for the most part, appellants' constitutional attacks.  The court found ""a clear and compelling interest,"" 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 192, 519 F.2d  at 841, in preserving the integrity of the electoral process.  On that basis, the court upheld, with one exception, [ Footnote 7 ] the substantive provisions of the Act with respect to contributions, expenditures, and disclosure.  It also sustained the constitutionality of the newly established Federal Election Commission.  The court concluded that, notwithstanding the manner of selection of its members and the breadth of its powers, which included nonlegislative functions, the Commission is a constitutionally authorized agency created to perform primarily legislative functions. [ Footnote 8 ]    The provisions for public funding of the three stages of the Presidential selection process were upheld as a valid exercise of congressional power under the General Welfare Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, § 8. In this Court, appellants argue that the Court of Appeals failed to give this legislation the critical scrutiny demanded under accepted First Amendment and equal protection principles.  In appellants' view, limiting the use of money for political purposes constitutes a restriction on communication violative of the First Amendment, since virtually all meaningful political communications in the modern setting involve the expenditure of money.  Further, they argue that the reporting and disclosure provisions of the Act unconstitutionally impinge on their right to freedom of association.  Appellants also view the federal subsidy provisions of Subtitle H as violative of the General Welfare Clause, and as inconsistent with the First and Fifth Amendments.  Finally, appellants renew their attack on the Commission's composition and powers. At the outset, we must determine whether the case before us presents a ""case or controversy"" within the meaning of Art. III of the Constitution.  Congress may not, of course, require this Court to render opinions in matters which are not ""cases or controversies.""   Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,   300 U. S. 227 ,   300 U. S. 240 -241 (1937).  We must therefore decide whether appellants have the ""personal stake in the outcome of the controversy"" necessary to meet the requirements of Art. III.   Baker v. Carr,   369 U. S. 186 ,   369 U. S. 204  (1962).  It is clear that Congress, in enacting   2 U.S.C. § 437h (1970 ed., Supp. IV), [ Footnote 9 ] intended to provide judicial review to the extent permitted by Art. III.  In our view, the complaint in this case demonstrates that at least some of the appellants have a sufficient ""personal stake"" [ Footnote 10 ] in a determination of the constitutional validity of each of the challenged provisions to present ""a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts."" Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, supra  at   300 U. S. 241 . [ Footnote 11 ] I . CONTRIBUTION AND EXPENDITURE LIMITATIONS The intricate statutory scheme adopted by Congress to regulate federal election campaigns includes restrictions   on political contributions and expenditures that apply broadly to all phases of and all participants in the election process.  The major contribution and expenditure limitations in the Act prohibit individuals from contributing more than $25,000 in a single year or more than $1,000 to any single candidate for an election campaign [ Footnote 12 ] and from spending more than $1,000 a year ""relative to a clearly identified candidate."" [ Footnote 13 ]  Other provisions restrict a candidate's use of personal and family resources in his campaign [ Footnote 14 ] and limit the over-all amount that can be spent by a candidate in campaigning for federal office. [ Footnote 15 ] The constitutional power of Congress to regulate federal elections is well established and is not questioned by any of the parties in this case. [ Footnote 16 ]  Thus, the critical constitutional   questions presented here go not to the basic power of Congress to legislate in this area, but to whether the specific legislation that Congress has enacted interferes with First Amendment freedoms or invidiously discriminates against nonincumbent candidates and minor parties in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. A. General Principles
 The Act's contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities.  Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution.  The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such political expression in order ""to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.""   Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 ,   354 U. S. 484  (1957).  Although First Amendment protections are not confined to ""the exposition of ideas,""  Winters v. New York,   333 U. S. 507 ,   333 U. S. 510  (1948), ""there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs, . . . of course includ[ing] discussions of candidates. . . ."" Mills v. Alabama,   384 U. S. 214 ,   384 U. S. 218  (1966).  This no more than reflects our ""profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,""  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 ,   376 U. S. 270  (1964).  In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates   for office is essential, for the identities of those who are elected will inevitably shape the course that we follow as a nation.  As the Court observed in  Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,   401 U. S. 265 ,   401 U. S. 272  (1971), ""it can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office."" The First Amendment protects political association as well as political expression.  The constitutional right of association explicated in  NAACP v. Alabama,   357 U. S. 449 ,   357 U. S. 460  (1958), stemmed from the Court's recognition that ""[e]ffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association."" Subsequent decisions have made clear that the First and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee "" freedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas,'"" a freedom that encompasses ""`[t]he right to associate with the political party of one's choice.'""   Kusper v. Pontikes,   414 U. S. 51 ,   414 U. S. 56 ,   414 U. S. 57  (1973), quoted in  Cousins v. Wigoda,   419 U. S. 477 ,   419 U. S. 487  (1975).
 It is with these principles in mind that we consider the primary contentions of the parties with respect to the Act's limitations upon the giving and spending of money in political campaigns.  Those conflicting contentions could not more sharply define the basic issues before us.  Appellees contend that what the Act regulates is conduct, and that its effect on speech and association is incidental, at most.  Appellants respond that contributions and expenditures are at the very core of political speech, and that the Act's limitations thus constitute restraints on First Amendment liberty that are both gross and direct. In upholding the constitutional validity of the Act's contribution and expenditure provisions on the ground   that those provisions should be viewed as regulating conduct, not speech, the Court of Appeals relied upon  United States v. O'Brien,   391 U. S. 367  (1968).   See  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 191, 519 F.2d  at 840.  The  O'Brien  case involved a defendant's claim that the First Amendment prohibited his prosecution for burning his draft card because his act was "" symbolic speech'"" engaged in as a ""`demonstration against the war and against the draft.'""  391 U.S. at   391 U. S. 376 .  On the assumption that ""the alleged communicative element in O'Brien's conduct [was] sufficient to bring into play the First Amendment,"" the Court sustained the conviction because it found ""a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element"" that was ""unrelated to the suppression of free expression"" and that had an ""incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms . . . no greater than [was] essential to the furtherance of that interest.""   Id.  at   391 U. S. 376 -377.  The Court expressly emphasized that  O'Brien  was not a case
 ""where the alleged governmental interest in regulating conduct arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful."" Id.  at   391 U. S. 382 . We cannot share the view that the present Act's contribution and expenditure limitations are comparable to the restrictions on conduct upheld in  O'Brien.   The expenditure of money simply cannot be equated with such conduct as destruction of a draft card.  Some forms of communication made possible by the giving and spending of money involve speech alone, some involve conduct primarily, and some involve a combination of the two.  Yet this Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to introduce a nonspeech element or to reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment.   See Bigelow v. Virginia,   421 U. S. 809 ,    421 U. S. 820  (1975);  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra  at   376 U. S. 266 .  For example, in  Cox v. Louisiana,   379 U. S. 559  (1965), the Court contrasted picketing and parading with a newspaper comment and a telegram by a citizen to a public official.  The parading and picketing activities were said to constitute conduct ""intertwined with expression and association,"" whereas the newspaper comment and the telegram were described as a ""pure form of expression"" involving ""free speech alone,"" rather than ""expression mixed with particular conduct.""   Id.  at   379 U. S. 563 -564. Even if the categorization of the expenditure of money as conduct were accepted, the limitations challenged here would not meet the  O'Brien  test because the governmental interests advanced in support of the Act involve ""suppressing communication.""  The interests served by the Act include restricting the voices of people and interest groups who have money to spend and reducing the over-all scope of federal election campaigns.  Although the Act does not focus on the ideas expressed by persons or groups subject to its regulations, it is aimed in part at equalizing the relative ability of all voters to affect electoral outcomes by placing a ceiling on expenditures for political expression by citizens and groups.  Unlike  O'Brien,  where the Selective Service System's administrative interest in the preservation of draft cards was wholly unrelated to their use as a means of communication, it is beyond dispute that the interest in regulating the alleged ""conduct"" of giving or spending money ""arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful.""  391 U.S. at   391 U. S. 382 . Nor can the Act's contribution and expenditure limitations be sustained, as some of the parties suggest, by reference to the constitutional principles reflected in such   decisions as  Cox v. Louisiana, supra; Adderley v. Florida,   385 U. S. 39  (1966); and  Kovacs v. Cooper,   336 U. S. 77  (1949).  Those cases stand for the proposition that the government may adopt reasonable time, place, and manner regulations, which do not discriminate among speakers or ideas, in order to further an important governmental interest unrelated to the restriction of communication.   See Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville,   422 U. S. 205 ,   422 U. S. 209  (1975).  In contrast to  O'Brien,  where the method of expression was held to be subject to prohibition,  Cox, Adderley,  and  Kovacs  involved place or manner restrictions on legitimate modes of expression -- picketing, parading, demonstrating, and using a sound truck.  The critical difference between this case and those time, place, and manner cases is that the present Act's contribution and expenditure limitations impose direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by persons, groups, candidates, and political parties in addition to any reasonable time, place, and manner regulations otherwise imposed. [ Footnote 17 ]  A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. [ Footnote 18 ] This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech. The expenditure limitations contained in the Act represent substantial, rather than merely theoretical, restraints on the quantity and diversity of political speech.  The $1,000 ceiling on spending ""relative to a clearly identified candidate,"" 18 U.S.C. § 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), would appear to exclude all citizens and groups except candidates, political parties, and the institutional press [ Footnote 19 ] from any significant use of the most   effective modes of communication. [ Footnote 20 ]  Although the Act's limitations on expenditures by campaign organizations and political parties provide substantially greater room for discussion and debate, they would have required restrictions in the scope of a number of past congressional and Presidential campaigns [ Footnote 21 ] and would operate to constrain campaigning by candidates who raise sums in excess of the spending ceiling. By contrast with a limitation upon expenditures for political expression, a limitation upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free communication.    A contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.  The quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated, symbolic act of contributing.  At most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor's support for the candidate. [ Footnote 22 ]  A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues.  While contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor. Given the important role of contributions in financing political campaigns, contribution restrictions could have a severe impact on political dialogue if the limitations prevented candidates and political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.  There is no indication, however, that the contribution limitations imposed by the Act would have any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns and political associations. [ Footnote 23 ]  The over-all effect of the Act's contribution   ceilings is merely to require candidates and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons and to compel people who would otherwise contribute amounts greater than the statutory limits to expend such funds on direct political expression, rather than to reduce the total amount of money potentially available to promote political expression. The Act's contribution and expenditure limitations also impinge on protected associational freedoms.  Making a contribution, like joining a political party, serves to affiliate a person with a candidate.  In addition, it enables like-minded persons to pool their resources in furtherance of common political goals.  The Act's contribution ceilings thus limit one important means of associating with a candidate or committee, but leave the contributor free to become a member of any political association and to assist personally in the association's efforts on behalf of candidates.  And the Act's contribution limitations permit associations and candidates to aggregate large sums of money to promote effective advocacy.  By contrast, the Act's $1,000 limitation on independent expenditures ""relative to a clearly identified candidate"" precludes most associations from effectively amplifying the voice of their adherents, the original basis for the recognition of First Amendment protection of the freedom of association.   See NAACP v. Alabama,  357 U.S. at   357 U. S. 460 .  The Act's constraints on the ability of independent associations and candidate campaign organizations to expend resources on political expression ""is simultaneously an interference with the freedom of [their] adherents,""  Sweezy v. New Hampshire,   354 U. S. 234 ,   354 U. S. 250  (1957) (plurality opinion).   See Cousins v.     Wigoda,  419 U.S. at   419 U. S. 487 -488;  NAACP v. Button,   371 U. S. 415 ,   371 U. S. 431  (1963). In sum, although the Act's contribution and expenditure limitations both implicate fundamental First Amendment interests, its expenditure ceilings impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than do its limitations on financial contributions. B. Contribution Limitations
 1. The $1,000 Limitation on Contributions by Individuals and Groups to Candidates and Authorized Campaign Committees Section 608(b) provides, with certain limited exceptions, that ""no person shall make contributions to any candidate with respect to any election for Federal office which, in the aggregate, exceed $1,000."" The statute defines ""person"" broadly to include ""an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation or any other organization or group of persons.""  § 591(g).  The limitation reaches a gift, subscription, loan, advance, deposit of anything of value, or promise to give a contribution, made for the purpose of influencing a primary election, a Presidential preference primary, or a general election for any federal office. [ Footnote 24 ]  §§ 591(e)(1), (2).  The   $1,000 ceiling applies regardless of whether the contribution is given to the candidate, to a committee authorized in writing by the candidate to accept contributions on his behalf, or indirectly via earmarked gifts passed through an intermediary to the candidate.  §§ 608(b)(4), (6). [ Footnote 25 ]  The restriction applies to aggregate amounts contributed to the candidate for each election -- with primaries, runoff elections, and general elections counted separately, and all Presidential primaries held in any calendar year treated together as a single election campaign.  § 608(b)(5). Appellants contend that the $1,000 contribution ceiling unjustifiably burdens First Amendment freedoms, employs overbroad dollar limits, and discriminates against candidates opposing incumbent officeholders and against minor party candidates in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  We address each of these claims of invalidity in turn. (a)
 As the general discussion in Part   424 U. S.     supra,  indicated, the primary First Amendment problem raised by the Act's contribution limitations is their restriction of one aspect of the contributor's freedom of political association.   The Court's decisions involving associational freedoms establish that the right of association is a ""basic constitutional freedom,""  Kusper v. Pontikes,  414 U.S. at   414 U. S. 57 , that is ""closely allied to freedom of speech and a right which, like free speech, lies at the foundation of a free society.""   Shelton v. Tucker,   364 U. S. 479 ,   364 U. S. 486  (1960).   See, e.g., Bates v. Little Rock,   361 U. S. 516 ,   361 U. S. 522 -523 (1960);  NAACP v. Alabama, supra  at   357 U. S. 460 -461;  NAACP v. Button, supra  at   371 U. S. 452  (Harlan, J., dissenting).  In view of the fundamental nature of the right to associate, governmental ""action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny.""   NAACP v. Alabama, supra  at   357 U. S. 460 -461.  Yet, it is clear that ""[n]either the right to associate nor the right to participate in political activities is absolute.""   CSC v. Letter Carriers,   413 U. S. 548 ,   413 U. S. 567  (1973).  Even a "" significant interference' with protected rights of political association"" may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.   Cousins v. Wigoda, supra  at   419 U. S. 488 ;  NAACP v. Button, supra  at   371 U. S. 438 ;  Shelton v. Tucker, supra  at   364 U. S. 488 .
 Appellees argue that the Act's restrictions on large campaign contributions are justified by three governmental interests.  According to the parties and  amici,  the primary interest served by the limitations and, indeed, by the Act as a whole, is the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption spawned by the real or imagined coercive influence of large financial contributions on candidates' positions and on their actions if elected to office.  Two ""ancillary"" interests underlying the Act are also allegedly furthered by the $1,000 limits on contributions.  First, the limits serve to mute the voices of affluent persons and groups in the election   process and thereby to equalize the relative ability of all citizens to affect the outcome of elections. [ Footnote 26 ]  Second, it is argued, the ceilings may to some extent act as a brake on the skyrocketing cost of political campaigns and thereby serve to open the political system more widely to candidates without access to sources of large amounts of money. [ Footnote 27 ] It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose -- to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions -- in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation.  Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign.  The increasing importance of the communications media and sophisticated mass-mailing and polling operations to effective campaigning make the raising of large sums of money an ever more essential ingredient of an effective candidacy.  To the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political  quid pro quo  from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of   representative democracy is undermined.  Although the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained, the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 election demonstrate that the problem is not an illusory one. [ Footnote 28 ] Of almost equal concern as the danger of actual  quid pro quo  arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.  In  CSC v. Letter Carriers, supra,  the Court found that the danger to ""fair and effective government"" posed by partisan political conduct on the part of federal employees charged with administering the law was a sufficiently important concern to justify broad restrictions on the employees' right of partisan political association.  Here, as there, Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence ""is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.""  413 U.S. at   413 U. S. 565 . [ Footnote 29 ] Appellants contend that the contribution limitations must be invalidated because bribery laws and narrowly drawn disclosure requirements constitute a less restrictive means of dealing with ""proven and suspected  quid pro quo  arrangements.""  But laws making criminal   the giving and taking of bribes deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action.  And while disclosure requirements serve the many salutary purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, [ Footnote 30 ]  Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure, and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions are fully disclosed. The Act's $1,000 contribution limitation focuses precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions -- the narrow aspect of political association where the actuality and potential for corruption have been identified -- while leaving persons free to engage in independent political expression, to associate actively through volunteering their services, and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and committees with financial resources. [ Footnote 31 ]  Significantly, the   Act's contribution limitations in themselves do not undermine to any material degree the potential for robust and effective discussion of candidates and campaign issues by individual citizens, associations, the institutional press, candidates, and political parties. We find that, under the rigorous standard of review established by our prior decisions, the weighty interests served by restricting the size of financial contributions to political candidates are sufficient to justify the limited effect upon First Amendment freedoms caused by the $1,000 contribution ceiling. (b)
 Appellants' first overbreadth challenge to the contribution ceilings rests on the proposition that most large contributors do not seek improper influence over a candidate's position or an officeholder's action.  Although the truth of that proposition may be assumed, it does not   undercut the validity of the $1,000 contribution limitation.  Not only is it difficult to isolate suspect contributions but, more importantly, Congress was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated. A second, related overbreadth claim is that the $1,000 restriction is unrealistically low because much more than that amount would still not be enough to enable an unscrupulous contributor to exercise improper influence over a candidate or officeholder, especially in campaigns for state-wide or national office.  While the contribution limitation provisions might well have been structured to take account of the graduated expenditure limitations for congressional and Presidential campaigns, [ Footnote 32 ] Congress' failure to engage in such fine tuning does not invalidate the legislation.  As the Court of Appeals observed, ""[i]f it is satisfied that some limit on contributions is necessary, a court has no scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000."" 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 193, 519 F.2d  at 842.  Such distinctions in degree become significant only when they can be said to amount to differences in kind.   Compare Kusper v. Pontikes,   414 U. S. 51  (1973),  with Rosario v. Rockefeller,   410 U. S. 752  (1973). (c)
 Apart from these First Amendment concerns, appellants argue that the contribution limitations work such an invidious discrimination between incumbents   and challengers that the statutory provisions must be declared unconstitutional on their face. [ Footnote 33 ]  In considering this contention, it is important at the outset to note that the Act applies the same limitations on contributions to all candidates regardless of their present occupations, ideological views, or party affiliations.  Absent record evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a class, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restrictions.   Cf. James v. Valtierra,   402 U. S. 137  (1971).  There is no such evidence to support the claim that the contribution limitations in themselves discriminate against major party challengers to incumbents.  Challengers can and often do defeat incumbents in federal elections. [ Footnote 34 ]  Major party challengers in federal elections are usually men and women who are well known and influential in their community or State.  Often such challengers are themselves incumbents in important local, state, or federal offices.  Statistics in the record indicate that major party challengers as well as incumbents are capable of raising large sums for campaigning. [ Footnote 35 ]  Indeed, a small but nonetheless significant number of challengers have in recent elections outspent their incumbent rivals. [ Footnote 36 ]  And, to the extent that incumbents generally are more likely than challengers to attract very large contributions, the Act's $1,000 ceiling has the practical effect of benefiting challengers as a class. [ Footnote 37 ]  Contrary to the broad generalization   drawn by the appellants, the practical impact of the contribution ceilings in any given election will clearly depend upon the amounts in excess of the ceilings that, for various reasons, the candidates in that election would otherwise have received and the utility of these additional amounts to the candidates.  To be sure, the limitations may have a significant effect on particular challengers or incumbents, but the record provides no basis for predicting that such adventitious factors will invariably and invidiously benefit incumbents as a class. [ Footnote 38 ]  Since the danger of corruption and the appearance of corruption apply with equal force to challengers and to incumbents, Congress had ample justification for imposing the same fundraising constraints upon both. The charge of discrimination against minor party and independent candidates is more troubling, but the record provides no basis for concluding that the Act invidiously disadvantages such candidates.  As noted above, the Act, on its face treats, all candidates equally with regard to contribution limitations.  And the restriction would appear to benefit minor party and independent candidates relative to their major party opponents, because major party candidates receive far more money in large contributions. [ Footnote 39 ]  Although there is some   force tax appellants' response that minor party candidates are primarily concerned with their ability to amass the resources necessary to reach the electorate, rather than with their funding position relative to their major party opponents, the record is virtually devoid of support for the claim that the $1,000 contribution limitation will have a serious effect on the initiation and scope of minor party and independent candidacies. [ Footnote 40 ]  Moreover, any attempt   to exclude minor parties and independents  en masse  from the Act's contribution limitations overlooks the fact that minor party candidates may win elective office or have a substantial impact on the outcome of an election. [ Footnote 41 ] In view of these considerations, we conclude that the impact of the Act's $1,000 contribution limitation on major party challengers and on minor party candidates does not render the provision unconstitutional on its face. 2. The $5,000 Limitation on Contributions by Political Committees Section 608(b)(2) permits certain committees, designated as ""political committees,"" to contribute up to $5,000 to any candidate with respect to any election for federal office.  In order to qualify for the higher contribution ceiling, a group must have been registered with the Commission as a political committee under 2 U.S.C. § 433 (1970 ed., Supp. IV) for not less than six months, have received contributions from more than 50 persons, and, except for state political party organizations, have contributed to five or more candidates for federal office.  Appellants argue that these qualifications unconstitutionally discriminate against  ad hoc  organizations in favor of established interest groups and impermissibly burden free association.  The argument is without merit.  Rather than undermining freedom of association, the basic provision enhances the opportunity of  bona fide  groups to participate in the election process, and the registration, contribution, and candidate conditions serve the permissible purpose of preventing individuals   from evading the applicable contribution limitations by labeling themselves committees. 3. Limitations on Volunteers' Incidental Expenses The Act excludes from the definition of contribution ""the value of services provided without compensation by individuals who volunteer a portion or all of their time on behalf of a candidate or political committee."" § 591(e)(5)(A).  Certain expenses incurred by persons in providing volunteer services to a candidate are exempt from the $1,000 ceiling only to the extent that they do not exceed $500.  These expenses are expressly limited to (1) ""the use of real or personal property and the cost of invitations, food, and beverages, voluntarily provided by an individual to a candidate in rendering voluntary personal services on the individual's residential premises for candidate-related activities,"" § 591(e)(5)(B); (2) ""the sale of any food or beverage by a vendor for use in a candidate's campaign at a charge [at least equal to cost but] less than the normal comparable charge,"" § 591(e)(5)(C); and (3) ""any unreimbursed payment for travel expenses made by an individual who on his own behalf volunteers his personal services to a candidate,"" § 591(e)(5)(D). If, as we have held, the basic contribution limitations are constitutionally valid, then surely these provisions are a constitutionally acceptable accommodation of Congress' valid interest in encouraging citizen participation in political campaigns while continuing to guard against the corrupting potential of large financial contributions to candidates.  The expenditure of resources at the candidate's direction for a fundraising event at a volunteer's residence or the provision of in-kind assistance in the form of food or beverages to be resold to raise funds or consumed by the participants in such an event provides material financial assistance to a candidate.  The ultimate   effect is the same as if the person had contributed the dollar amount to the candidate and the candidate had then used the contribution to pay for the fundraising event or the food.  Similarly, travel undertaken as a volunteer at the direction of the candidate or his staff is an expense of the campaign and may properly be viewed as a contribution if the volunteer absorbs the fare.  Treating these expenses as contributions when made to the candidate's campaign or at the direction of the candidate or his staff forecloses an avenue of abuse [ Footnote 42 ] without limiting actions voluntarily undertaken by citizens independently of a candidate's campaign. [ Footnote 43 ]  4. The 25,000 Limitation on Total Contributions During any Calendar Year In addition to the $1,000 limitation on the nonexempt contributions that an individual may make to a particular candidate for any single election, the Act contains an over-all $25,000 limitation on total contributions by an individual during any calendar year.  § 608(b)(3).  A contribution made in connection with an election is considered, for purposes of this subsection, to be made in the year the election is held.  Although the constitutionality of this provision was drawn into question by appellants, it has not been separately addressed at length by the parties.  The over-all $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support.  But this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate's political party.  The limited, additional restriction on associational freedom imposed by the over-all ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid.  C. Expenditure Limitations
 The Act's expenditure ceilings impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech.  The most drastic of the limitations restricts individuals and groups, including political parties that fail to place a candidate on the ballot, [ Footnote 44 ] to an expenditure of $1,000 ""relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year.""  § 608(e)(1).  Other expenditure ceilings limit spending by candidates, § 608(a), their campaigns, § 608(c), and political parties in connection with election campaigns, § 608(f).  It is clear that a primary effect of these expenditure limitations is to restrict the quantity of campaign speech by individuals, groups, and candidates.  The restrictions, while neutral as to the ideas expressed, limit political expression ""at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms.""   Williams v. Rhodes,   393 U. S. 23 ,   393 U. S. 32  (1968). 1. The $1,000 Limitation on Expenditures ""Relative to a Clearly Identified Candidate"" Section 608(e)(1) provides that ""[n]o person may make any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year which, when added to all other expenditures made by such person during the year advocating the election or defeat of such candidate, exceeds $1,000. [ Footnote 45 ]"" The plain effect of § 608(e)(1) is to   prohibit all individuals, who are neither candidates nor owners of institutional press facilities, and all groups, except political parties and campaign organizations, from voicing their views ""relative to a clearly identified candidate"" through means that entail aggregate expenditures of more than $1,000 during a calendar year.  The provision, for example, would make it a federal criminal offense for a person or association to place a single one-quarter page advertisement ""relative to a clearly identified candidate"" in a major metropolitan newspaper. [ Footnote 46 ] Before examining the interests advanced in support of § 608(e)(1)'s expenditure ceiling, consideration must be given to appellants' contention that the provision is unconstitutionally vague. [ Footnote 47 ]  Close examination of the   specificity of the statutory limitation is required where, as here, the legislation imposes criminal penalties in an area permeated by First Amendment interests.   See Smith v. Goguen,   415 U. S. 566 ,   415 U. S. 573  (1974);  Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction,   368 U. S. 278 ,   368 U. S. 287 -288 (1961);  Smith v. California,   361 U. S. 147 ,   361 U. S. 151  (1959). [ Footnote 48 ]  The test is whether the language of § 608(e)(1) affords the ""[p]recision of regulation [that] must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.""   NAACP v. Button,  371 U.S. at   371 U. S. 438 . The key operative language of the provision limits ""any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified candidate.""  Although ""expenditure,"" ""clearly identified,"" and ""candidate"" are defined in the Act, there is no definition clarifying what expenditures are ""relative to"" a candidate.  The use of so indefinite a phrase as ""relative to"" a candidate fails to clearly mark the boundary between permissible and impermissible speech, unless other portions of § 608(e)(1) make sufficiently explicit the range of expenditures   covered by the limitation.  The section prohibits ""any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year which,  when added to all other expenditures . . . advocation the election or defeat of such candidate,  exceeds $1,000.""  (Emphasis added.)  This context clearly permits, if indeed it does not require, the phrase ""relative to"" a candidate to be read to mean ""advocating the election or defeat of"" a candidate. [ Footnote 49 ] But while such a construction of § 608(e)(1) refocuses the vagueness question, the Court of Appeals was mistaken in thinking that this construction eliminates the problem of unconstitutional vagueness altogether.  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 204, 519 F.2d  at 853.  For the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.  Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions.  Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest. [ Footnote 50 ]  In an analogous   context, this Court in  Thomas v. Collins,   323 U. S. 516  (1945), observed: ""[W]hether words intended and designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect.  No speaker, in such circumstances, safely could assume that anything he might say upon the general subject would not be understood by some as an invitation.  In short, the supposedly clear-cut distinction between discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and solicitation puts the speaker in these circumstances wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding of his hearers and consequently of whatever inference may be drawn as to his intent and meaning."" ""Such a distinction offers no security for free discussion.  In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty whatever may be said.  It compels the speaker to hedge and trim."" Id.  at   323 U. S. 535 .   See also United States v. Auto. Workers,   352 U. S. 567 ,   352 U. S. 595 -596 (1957) (Douglas, J., dissenting);  Gitlow v. New York,   268 U. S. 652 ,   268 U. S. 673  (1925) (Holmes, J., dissenting). The constitutional deficiencies described in  Thomas v. Collins  can be avoided only by reading § 608(e)(1) as limited to communications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate, much as the definition of ""clearly identified"" in § 608(e)(2) requires that an explicit and unambiguous reference to the candidate appear as part of the communication. [ Footnote 51 ]  This   is the reading of the provision suggested by the nongovernmental appellees in arguing that ""[f]unds spent to propagate one's views on issues without expressly calling for a candidate's election or defeat are thus not covered.""  We agree that, in order to preserve the provision against invalidation on vagueness grounds, § 608(e)(1) must be construed to apply only to expenditures for communications that, in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office. [ Footnote 52 ] We turn then to the basic First Amendment question -- whether § 608(e)(1), even as thus narrowly and explicitly construed, impermissibly burdens the constitutional right of free expression.  The Court of Appeals summarily held the provision constitutionally valid on the ground that ""section 608(e) is a loophole-closing provision only"" that is necessary to prevent circumvention of the contribution limitations.  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 204, 519 F.2d  at 853.  We cannot agree. The discussion in   424 U. S.     supra,  explains why the Act's expenditure limitations impose far greater restraints on the freedom of speech and association than do its contribution limitations.  The markedly greater burden on basic freedoms caused by § 608(e)(1) thus cannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations.  Rather, the constitutionality of § 608(e)(1) turns on whether the governmental interests advanced in its support satisfy the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations   on core First Amendment rights of political expression. We find that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate to justify § 608(e)(1)'s ceiling on independent expenditures.  First, assuming,  arguendo,  that large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent  quid pro quo  arrangements as do large contributions, § 608(e)(1) does not provide an answer that sufficiently relates to the elimination of those dangers.  Unlike the contribution limitations' total ban on the giving of large amounts of money to candidates, § 608(e)(1) prevents only some large expenditures.  So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that, in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views.  The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness thus undermines the limitation's effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat, but nevertheless benefited the candidate's campaign.  Yet no substantial societal interest would be served by a loophole-closing provision designed to check corruption that permitted unscrupulous persons and organizations to expend unlimited sums of money in order to obtain improper influence over candidates for elective office.   Cf. Mills v. Alabama,  384 U.S. at   384 U. S. 220 . Second, quite apart from the shortcomings of § 608(e)(1)   in preventing any abuses generated by large independent expenditures, the independent advocacy restricted by the provision does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions.  The parties defending § 608(e)(1) contend that it is necessary to prevent would-be contributors from avoiding the contribution limitations by the simple expedient of paying directly for media advertisements or for other portions of the candidate's campaign activities.  They argue that expenditures controlled by or coordinated with the candidate and his campaign might well have virtually the same value to the candidate as a contribution and would pose similar dangers of abuse.  Yet such controlled or coordinated expenditures are treated as contributions, rather than expenditures under the Act. [ Footnote 53 ]  Section 608(b)'s   contribution ceilings, rather than § 608(e)(1)'s independent expenditure limitation, prevent attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions.  By contrast, 608(e)(1) limits expenditures for express advocacy of candidates made totally independently of the candidate and his campaign.  Unlike contributions, such independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidate's campaign, and indeed may prove counterproductive.  The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a  quid pro quo  for improper commitments from the candidate.  Rather than preventing circumvention of the contribution limitations, § 608(e)(1) severely restricts all independent advocacy despite its substantially diminished potential for abuse. While the independent expenditure ceiling thus fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming   the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process, it heavily burdens core First Amendment expression.  For the First Amendment right to "" speak one's mind . . . on all public institutions'"" includes the right to engage in ""`vigorous advocacy' no less than `abstract discussion.'""   New York Times Co. v Sullivan,  376 U.S. at   376 U. S. 269 , quoting  Bridges v. California,   314 U. S. 252 ,   314 U. S. 270  (1941), and  NAACP v. Button,  371 U.S. at   371 U. S. 429 .  Advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates for federal office is no less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of the passage or defeat of legislation. [ Footnote 54 ]  It is argued, however, that the ancillary governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections serves to justify the limitation on express advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates imposed by § 608(e)(1)'s expenditure ceiling. �But the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in   order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed ""to secure `the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources,'"" and ""`to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.'""   New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra  at   376 U. S. 266 ,   376 U. S. 269 , quoting  Associated Press v. United States,   326 U. S. 1 ,   326 U. S. 20  (1945), and  Roth v. United States,  354 U.S. at   354 U. S. 484 .  The First Amendment's protection against governmental abridgment of free expression cannot properly be made to depend on a person's financial ability to engage in public discussion.   Cf. Eastern R. Conf. v. Noerr Motors,   365 U. S. 127 ,   365 U. S. 13  (1961). [ Footnote 55 ]    The Court's decisions in  Mills v. Alabama,   384 U. S. 214  (1966), and  Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,   418 U. S. 241  (1974), held that legislative restrictions on advocacy of the election or defeat of political candidates are wholly at odds with the guarantees of the First Amendment.  In  Mills,  the Court addressed the question whether ""a State, consistently with the United States Constitution, can make it a crime for the editor of a daily newspaper to write and publish an editorial  on election day  urging people to vote a certain way on issues submitted to them."" 384 U.S. at   384 U. S. 215  (emphasis in original).  We held that ""no test of reasonableness can save [such] a state law from invalidation as a violation of the First Amendment.""   Id.  at   384 U. S. 220 .  Yet the prohibition of election day editorials invalidated in  Mills  is clearly a lesser intrusion on constitutional freedom than a $1,000 limitation on the amount of money any person or association can spend during an entire election year in advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for public office.  More recently, in  Tornillo,  the Court held that Florida could not constitutionally require a newspaper   to make space available for a political candidate to reply to its criticism.  Yet, under the Florida statute, every newspaper was free to criticize any candidate as much as it pleased so long as it undertook the modest burden of printing his reply.   See  418 U.S. at   418 U. S. 256 -257.  The legislative restraint involved in  Tornillo  thus also pales in comparison to the limitations imposed by § 608(e)(1). [ Footnote 56 ] For the reasons stated, we conclude that § 608(e)(1)'s independent expenditure limitation is unconstitutional under the First Amendment. 2. Limitation on Expenditures by Candidates from Personal or Family Resources The Act also sets limits on expenditures by a candidate ""from his personal funds, or the personal funds of his immediate family, in connection with his campaigns during any calendar year.""  § 608(a)(1).  These ceilings vary from $50,000 for Presidential or Vice Presidential candidates to $35,000 for senatorial candidates, and $25,000 for most candidates for the House of Representatives. [ Footnote 57 ]  The ceiling on personal expenditures by candidates on their own behalf, like the limitations on independent expenditures contained in § 608(e)(1), imposes a substantial restraint on the ability of persons to engage in protected First Amendment expression. [ Footnote 58 ]  The candidate, no less than any other person, has a First Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election and the election of other candidates.  Indeed, it is of particular importance that candidates have the unfettered   opportunity to make their views known so that the electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates' personal qualities and their positions on vital public issues before choosing among them on election day.  Mr. Justice Brandeis' observation that, in our country ""public discussion is a political duty,""  Whitney v. California,   274 U. S. 357 ,   274 U. S. 375  (1927) (concurring opinion), applies with special force to candidates for public office.  Section 608(a)'s ceiling on personal expenditures by a candidate in furtherance of his own candidacy thus clearly and directly interferes with constitutionally protected freedoms. The primary governmental interest served by the Act -- the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process -- does not support the limitation on the candidate's expenditure of his own personal funds.  As the Court of Appeals concluded: ""Manifestly, the core problem of avoiding undisclosed and undue influence on candidates from outside interests has lesser application when the monies involved come from the candidate himself or from his immediate family."" 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 206, 519 F.2d  at 855.  Indeed, the use of personal funds reduces the candidate's dependence on outside contributions, and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which the Act's contribution limitations are directed. [ Footnote 59 ]  The ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office, therefore, provides the sole relevant rationale for § 608(a)'s expenditure ceiling.  That interest is clearly not sufficient to justify the provision's infringement of fundamental First Amendment rights.  First, the limitation may fail to promote financial equality among candidates.  A candidate who spends less of his personal resources on his campaign may nonetheless outspend his rival as a result of more successful fundraising efforts.  Indeed, a candidate's personal wealth may impede his efforts to persuade others that he needs their financial contributions or volunteer efforts to conduct an effective campaign.  Second, and more fundamentally, the First Amendment simply cannot tolerate § 608(a)'s restriction upon the freedom of a candidate to speak without legislative limit on behalf of his own candidacy.  We therefore hold that § 608(a)'s restriction on a candidate's personal expenditures is unconstitutional. 3. Limitations on Campaign Expenditures Section 608(c) places limitations on over-all campaign expenditures by candidates seeking nomination for election and election to federal office. [ Footnote 60 ]  Presidential candidates may spend $10,000,000 in seeking nomination for office, and an additional $20,000,000 in the general election campaign.  §§ 608(c)(1)(A), (B). [ Footnote 61 ]    The ceiling on senatorial campaigns is pegged to the size of the voting-age population of the State, with minimum dollar amounts applicable to campaigns in States with small populations.  In senatorial primary elections, the limit is the greater of eight cents multiplied by the voting-age population or $100,000, and, in the general election, the limit is increased to 12 cents multiplied by the voting-age population, or $150,000.  §§ 608(c)(1)(C), (D).  The Act imposes blanket $70,000 limitations on both primary campaigns and general election campaigns for the House of Representatives, with the exception that the senatorial ceiling applies to campaigns in States entitled to only one Representative.  §§ 608(c)(1)(C)(E).  These ceilings are to be adjusted upwards at the beginning of each calendar year by the average percentage rise in the consumer price index for the 12 preceding months.  § 608(d). [ Footnote 62 ] No governmental interest that has been suggested is sufficient to justify the restriction on the quantity of political expression imposed by § 608(c)'s campaign expenditure limitations.  The major evil associated with rapidly increasing campaign expenditures is the danger of candidate dependence on large contributions.  The interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by the Act's contribution limitations and disclosure provisions, rather than by § 608(c)'s campaign expenditure ceilings.  The Court of Appeals' assertion that the expenditure restrictions are necessary to reduce the incentive to circumvent direct contribution limits is not persuasive.   See  171 U.S.App.D.C.   at 210, 519 F.2d  at 859.  There is no indication that the substantial criminal penalties for violating the contribution ceilings, combined with the political repercussion of such violations, will be insufficient to police the contribution provisions.  Extensive reporting, auditing, and disclosure requirements applicable to both contributions and expenditures by political campaigns are designed to facilitate the detection of illegal contributions.  Moreover, as the Court of Appeals noted, the Act permits an officeholder or successful candidate to retain contributions in excess of the expenditure ceiling, and to use these funds for ""any other lawful purpose.""  2 U.S.C. § 439a (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  This provision undercuts whatever marginal role the expenditure limitations might otherwise play in enforcing the contribution ceilings. The interest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates competing for federal office is no more convincing a justification for restricting the scope of federal election campaigns.  Given the limitation on the size of outside contributions, the financial resources available to a candidate's campaign, like the number of volunteers recruited, will normally vary with the size and intensity of the candidate's support. [ Footnote 63 ]  There is nothing invidious, improper, or unhealthy in permitting such funds to be spent to carry the candidate's message to the electorate. [ Footnote 64 ]  Moreover, the equalization of permissible campaign expenditures   might serve not to equalize the opportunities of all candidates, but to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign. The campaign expenditure ceilings appear to be designed primarily to serve the governmental interests in reducing the allegedly skyrocketing costs of political campaigns.  Appellees and the Court of Appeals stressed statistics indicating that spending for federal election campaigns increased almost 300% between 1952 and 1972 in comparison with a 57.6% rise in the consumer price index during the same period.  Appellants respond that, during these years, the rise in campaign spending lagged behind the percentage increase in total expenditures for commercial advertising and the size of the gross national product.  In any event, the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns, in and of itself, provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending and the resulting limitation on the scope of federal campaigns.  The First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise.  In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the government, but the people -- individually, as citizens and candidates, and collectively, as associations and political committees -- who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. [ Footnote 65 ]  For these reasons, we hold that § 608(c) is constitutionally invalid. [ Footnote 66 ] In sum, the provisions of the Act that impose a $1,000 limitation on contributions to a single candidate, § 608(b)(1), a $5,000 limitation on contributions by a political committee to a single candidate, § 608(b)(2), and a $25,000 limitation on total contributions by an individual during any calendar year, § 608(b)(3), are constitutionally valid.  These limitations, along with the disclosure provisions, constitute the Act's primary weapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence stemming from the dependence of candidates on large campaign contributions.  The contribution ceilings thus serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion.  By contrast, the First Amendment requires the invalidation of the Act's independent expenditure ceiling, § 608(e)(1), its limitation on a candidate's expenditures from his own personal funds, § 608(a), and its ceilings on over-all campaign expenditures, § 608(e).  These provisions place substantial and direct restrictions   on the ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions that the First Amendment cannot tolerate. [ Footnote 67 ]  II . REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS Unlike the limitations on contributions and expenditures imposed by 18 U.S.C. § 608 (1970 ed., Supp. IV), the disclosure requirements of the Act, 2 U.S.C. § 431  et seq.  (1970 ed., Supp. IV), [ Footnote 68 ] are not challenged by appellants as  per se  unconstitutional restrictions on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms of speech and association. [ Footnote 69 ] Indeed, appellants argue that ""narrowly drawn disclosure requirements are the proper solution to virtually all of the evils Congress sought to remedy.""  Brief for Appellants 171.  The particular requirements   embodied in the Act are attacked as overbroad -- both in their application to minor party and independent candidates and in their extension to contributions as small as $11 or $101.  Appellants also challenge the provision for disclosure by those who make independent contributions and expenditures, § 434(e).  The Court of Appeals found no constitutional infirmities in the provisions challenged here. [ Footnote 70 ]  We affirm the determination on overbreadth and hold that § 434(e), if narrowly construed, also is within constitutional bounds. The first federal disclosure law was enacted in 1910.  Act of June 25, 1910, c. 392, 36 Stat. 822.  It required political committees, defined as national committees and national congressional campaign committees of parties, and organizations operating to influence congressional elections in two or more States, to disclose names of all contributors of $100 or more; identification of recipients of expenditures of $10 or more was also required.  §§ 1, 5-6, 36 Stat. 822-824.  Annual expenditures of $50 or more ""for the purpose of influencing or controlling, in two or more States, the result of"" a congressional election had to be reported independently if they were not made through a political committee.  § 7, 36 Stat. 824.  In 1911, the Act was revised to include pre-nomination transactions such as those involved in conventions and primary campaigns.  Act of Aug.19, 1911, § 2, 37 Stat. 26.   See United States v. Auto. Workers,  352 U.S. at   352 U. S. 575 -576. Disclosure requirements were broadened in the Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925 (Title III of the Act of Feb. 28, 1925), 43 Stat. 1070.  That Act required political committees, defined as organizations that accept contributions or make expenditures ""for the purpose of   influencing or attempting to influence"" the Presidential or Vice Presidential elections (a) in two or more States or (b) as a subsidiary of a national committee, § 302(c), 43 Stat. 1070, to report total contributions and expenditures, including the names and addresses of contributors of $100 or more and recipients of $10 or more in a calendar year.  § 305(a), 43 Stat. 1071.  The Act was upheld against a challenge that it infringed upon the prerogatives of the States in  Burroughs v. United States,   290 U. S. 534  (1934).  The Court held that it was within the power of Congress ""to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard [a Presidential] election from the improper use of money to influence the result.""   Id.  at   290 U. S. 545 .  Although the disclosure requirements were widely circumvented, [ Footnote 71 ] no further attempts were made to tighten them until 1960, when the Senate passed a bill that would have closed some existing loopholes.  S. 2436, 106 Cong.Rec. 1193.  The attempt aborted because no similar effort was made in the House. The Act presently under review replaced all prior disclosure laws.  Its primary disclosure provisions impose reporting obligations on ""political committees"" and candidates.  ""Political committee"" is defined in § 431(d) as a group of persons that receives ""contributions"" or makes ""expenditures"" of over $1,000 in a calendar year.  ""Contributions"" and ""expenditures"" are defined in lengthy parallel provisions similar to those in Title 18, discussed   above. [ Footnote 72 ] Both definitions focus on the use of money or other objects of value ""for the purpose of . . . influencing"" the nomination or election of any person to federal office.  §§ 431(e)(1), (f)(1) Each political committee is required to register with the Commission, § 433, and to keep detailed records of both contributions and expenditures, §§ 432(c), (d).  These records must include the name and address of everyone making a contribution in excess of $10, along with the date and amount of the contribution.  If a person's contributions aggregate more than $100, his occupation and principal place of business are also to be included.  § 432(c)(2).  These files are subject to periodic audits and field investigations by the Commission.  § 438(a)(8). Each committee and each candidate also is required to file quarterly reports. § 434(a).  The reports are to contain detailed financial information, including the full name, mailing address, occupation, and principal place of business of each person who has contributed over $100 in a calendar year, as well as the amount and date of the contributions.  § 434(b).  They are to be made available by the Commission ""for public inspection and copying.""  § 438(a)(4).  Every candidate for federal office is required to designate a ""principal campaign committee,"" which is to receive reports of contributions and expenditures made on the candidate's behalf from other political committees and to compile and file these reports, together with its own statements, with the Commission.  § 432(f). Every individual or group, other than a political committee or candidate, who makes ""contributions"" or ""expenditures"" of over $100 in a calendar year ""other than   by contribution to a political committee or candidate"" is required to file a statement with the Commission.  § 434(e).  Any violation of these recordkeeping and reporting provisions is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or a prison term of not more than a year, or both. § 441(a). A. General Principles
 Unlike the over-all limitations on contributions and expenditures, the disclosure requirements impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities.  But we have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.   E.g., Gibson v. Florida Legislative Comm.,   372 U. S. 539  (1963);  NAACP v. Button,   371 U. S. 415  (1963);  Shelton v. Tucker,   364 U. S. 479  (1960);  Bates v. Little Rock,   361 U. S. 516  (1960);  NAACP v. Alabama,   357 U. S. 449  (1958). We long have recognized that significant encroachments on First Amendment rights of the sort that compelled disclosure imposes cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest.  Since  NAACP v. Alabama,  we have required that the subordinating interests of the State must survive exacting scrutiny. [ Footnote 73 ]  We also have insisted that there be a ""relevant correlation"" [ Footnote 74 ] or ""substantial relation"" [ Footnote 75 ] between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed.   See Pollard v. Roberts,   283 F. Supp. 248 , 257 (ED Ark.) (three-judge court),  aff'd,   393 U. S. 14  (1968)   (per curiam).  This type of scrutiny is necessary even if any deterrent effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights arises not through direct government action, but indirectly, as an unintended but inevitable result of the government's conduct in requiring disclosure.   NAACP v. Alabama, supra  at   357 U. S. 461 .   Cf. Kusper v. Pontikes,  414 U.S. at   414 U. S. 57 -58. Appellees argue that the disclosure requirements of the Act differ significantly from those at issue in  NAACP v. Alabama  and its progeny, because the Act only requires disclosure of the names of contributors, and does not compel political organizations to submit the names of their members. [ Footnote 76 ] As we have seen, group association is protected because it enhances ""[e]ffective advocacy.""   NAACP v. Alabama, supra  at   357 U. S. 460 .  The right to Join together ""for the advancement of beliefs and ideas,""  ibid.,  is diluted if it does not include the right to pool money through contributions, for funds are often essential if ""advocacy"" is   to be truly or optimally ""effective.""  Moreover, the invasion of privacy of belief may be as great when the information sought concerns the giving and spending of money as when it concerns the joining of organizations, for ""[f]inancial transactions can reveal much about a person's activities, associations, and beliefs.""   California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz,   416 U. S. 21 ,   416 U. S. 78 -79 (1974) (POWELL, J., concurring).  Our past decisions have not drawn fine lines between contributors and members, but have treated them interchangeably.  In  Bates,  for example, we applied the principles of  NAACP v. Alabama  and reversed convictions for failure to comply with a city ordinance that required the disclosure of ""dues, assessments, and contributions paid, by whom and when paid.""  361 U.S. at   361 U. S. 518 .   See also United States v. Rumely,   345 U. S. 41  (1953) (setting aside a contempt conviction of an organization official who refused to disclose names of those who made bulk purchases of books sold by the organization). The strict test established by  NAACP v. Alabama  is necessary because compelled disclosure has the potential for substantially infringing the exercise of First Amendment rights.  But we have acknowledged that there are governmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of infringement, particularly when the ""free functioning of our national institutions"" is involved.   Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Bd.,   367 U. S. 1 ,   367 U. S. 97  (1961). The governmental interests sought to be vindicated by the disclosure requirements are of this magnitude.  They fall into three categories.  First, disclosure provides the electorate with information ""as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate"" [ Footnote 77 ] in order to aid the voters in evaluating those   who seek federal office.  It allows voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches.  The sources of a candidate's financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive, and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office. Second, disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity. [ Footnote 78 ]  This exposure may discourage those who would use money for improper purposes either before or after the election.  A public armed with information about a candidate's most generous supporters is better able to detect any post-election special favors that may be given in return. [ Footnote 79 ]  And, as we recognized in  Burroughs v. United States,  290 U.S. at   290 U. S. 548 , Congress could reasonably conclude that full disclosure during an election campaign tends ""to prevent the corrupt use of money to affect elections.""  In enacting these requirements, it may have been mindful of Mr. Justice Brandeis' advice: ""Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases.  Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman. [ Footnote 80 ]"" Third, and not least significant, recordkeeping, reporting,   and disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of the contribution limitations described above. The disclosure requirements, as a general matter, directly serve substantial governmental interests.  In determining whether these interests are sufficient to justify the requirements, we must look to the extent of the burden that they place on individual rights. It is undoubtedly true that public disclosure of contributions to candidates and political parties will deter some individuals who otherwise might contribute.  In some instances, disclosure may even expose contributors to harassment or retaliation.  These are not insignificant burdens on individual rights, and they must be weighed carefully against the interests which Congress has sought to promote by this legislation.  In this process, we note and agree with appellants' concession [ Footnote 81 ] that disclosure requirements -- certainly in most applications -- appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of campaign ignorance and corruption that Congress found to exist. [ Footnote 82 ]  Appellants argue, however, that the balance tips against disclosure when it is required of contributors to certain parties and candidates.  We turn now to this contention. B. Application to Minor Parties and Independents
 Appellants contend that the Act's requirements are overbroad insofar as they apply to contributions to minor   parties and independent candidates because the governmental interest in this information is minimal, and the danger of significant infringement on First Amendment rights is greatly increased. 1. Requisite Factual Showing In  NAACP v. Alabama,  the organization had ""made an uncontroverted showing that, on past occasions, revelation of the identity of its rank-and-file members [had] exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility,"" 357 U.S. at   357 U. S. 462 , and the State was unable to show that the disclosure it sought had a ""substantial bearing"" on the issues it sought to clarify,  id.  at   357 U. S. 464 .  Under those circumstances, the Court held that ""whatever interest the State may have in [disclosure] has not been shown to be sufficient to overcome petitioner's constitutional objections.""   Id.  at   357 U. S. 465 . The Court of Appeals rejected appellants' suggestion that this case fits into the  NAACP v. Alabama  mold.  It concluded that substantial governmental interests in ""informing the electorate and preventing the corruption of the political process"" were furthered by requiring disclosure of minor parties and independent candidates, 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 218, 519 F.2d  at 867, and therefore found no tenable rationale for assuming that the public interest in minority party disclosure of contributions above a reasonable cutoff point is uniformly outweighed by potential contributors' associational rights, id.  at 219, 519 F.2d  at 868.  The court left open the question of the application of the disclosure requirements to candidates (and parties) who could demonstrate injury of the sort at stake in  NAACP v. Alabama.   No record of harassment on a similar scale was found in this case. [ Footnote 83 ]  We agree with   the Court of Appeals' conclusion that  NAACP v. Alabama  is inapposite where, as here, any serious infringement on First Amendment rights brought about by the compelled disclosure of contributors is highly speculative. It is true that the governmental interest in disclosure is diminished when the contribution in question is made to a minor party with little chance of winning an election.  As minor parties usually represent definite and publicized viewpoints, there may be less need to inform the voters of the interests that specific candidates represent.  Major parties encompass candidates of greater diversity.  In many situations, the label ""Republican"" or ""Democrat"" tells a voter little.  The candidate who bears it may be supported by funds from the far right, the far left, or any place in between on the political spectrum.  It is less likely that a candidate of, say, the Socialist Labor Party will represent interests that cannot be discerned from the party's ideological position. The Government's interest in deterring the ""buying"" of elections and the undue influence of large contributors on officeholders also may be reduced where contributions to a minor party or an independent candidate are concerned, for it is less likely that the candidate will be victorious.  But a minor party sometimes can play a significant role in an election.  Even when a minor party candidate has little or no chance of winning, he may be encouraged by major party interests in order to divert votes from other major party contenders. [ Footnote 84 ]  We are not unmindful that the damage done by disclosure to the associational interests of the minor parties and their members and to supporters of independents could be significant.  These movements are less likely to have a sound financial base, and thus are more vulnerable to fall-offs in contributions.  In some instances, fears of reprisal may deter contributions to the point where the movement cannot survive.  The public interest also suffers if that result comes to pass, for there is a consequent reduction in the free circulation of ideas both within [ Footnote 85 ] and without [ Footnote 86 ] the political arena. There could well be a case, similar to those before the Court in  NAACP v. Alabama  and  Bates,  where the threat to the exercise of First Amendment rights is so serious, and the state interest furthered by disclosure so insubstantial, that the Act's requirements cannot be constitutionally applied. [ Footnote 87 ]  But no appellant in this case has tendered record evidence of the sort proffered in  NAACP v. Alabama.   Instead, appellants primarily rely on ""the clearly articulated fears of individuals, well experienced in the political process.""  Brief for Appellants 173.  At   best they offer the testimony of several minor party officials that one or two persons refused to make contributions because of the possibility of disclosure. [ Footnote 88 ]  On this record, the substantial public interest in disclosure identified by the legislative history of this Act outweighs the harm generally alleged. 2. Blanket Exemption Appellants agree that ""the record here does not reflect the kind of focused and insistent harassment of contributors and members that existed in the NAACP cases.""   Ibid.   They argue, however, that a blanket exemption for minor parties is necessary lest irreparable injury be done before the required evidence can be gathered. Those parties that would be sufficiently ""minor"" to be exempted from the requirements of § 434 could be defined, appellants suggest, along the lines used for public financing purposes,  see   424 U. S.     infra,  as those who received less than 25% of the vote in past elections.  Appellants do not argue that this line is constitutionally required.  They suggest as an alternative defining ""minor parties"" as those that do not qualify for automatic ballot access under state law.  Presumably, other criteria, such as current political strength (measured by polls or petition), age, or degree of organization, could also be used. [ Footnote 89 ] The difficulty with these suggestions is that they reflect only a party's past or present political strength, and   that is only one of the factors that must be considered.  Some of the criteria are not precisely indicative of even that factor.  Age, [ Footnote 90 ] or past political success, for instance, may typically be associated with parties that have a high probability of success.  But not all long-established parties are winners -- some are consistent losers -- and a new party may garner a great deal of support if it can associate itself with an issue that has captured the public's imagination.  None of the criteria suggested is precisely related to the other critical factor that must be considered, the possibility that disclosure will impinge upon protected associational activity. An opinion dissenting in part from the Court of Appeals' decision concedes that no one line is ""constitutionally required."" [ Footnote 91 ]  It argues, however, that a flat exemption for minor parties must be carved out, even along arbitrary lines, if groups that would suffer impermissibly from disclosure are to be given any real protection.  An approach that requires minor parties to submit evidence that the disclosure requirements cannot constitutionally be applied to them offers only an illusory safeguard, the argument goes, because the ""evils"" of ""chill and harassment . . . are largely incapable of formal proof."" [ Footnote 92 ]  This dissent expressed its concern that a minor party, particularly a   new party, may never be able to prove a substantial threat of harassment, however real that threat may be, because it would be required to come forward with witnesses who are too fearful to contribute but not too fearful to testify about their fear.  A strict requirement that chill and harassment be directly attributable to the specific disclosure from which the exemption is sought would make the task even more difficult. We recognize that unduly strict requirements of proof could impose a heavy burden, but it does not follow that a blanket exemption for minor parties is necessary.  Minor parties must be allowed sufficient flexibility in the proof of injury to assure a fair consideration of their claim.  The evidence offered need show only a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of a party's contributors' names will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.  The proof may include, for example, specific evidence of past or present harassment of members due to their associational ties, or of harassment directed against the organization itself.  A pattern of threats or specific manifestations of public hostility may be sufficient.  New parties that have no history upon which to draw may be able to offer evidence of reprisals and threats directed against individuals or organizations holding similar views. Where it exists, the type of chill and harassment identified in  NAACP v. Alabama  can be shown.  We cannot assume that courts will be insensitive to similar showings when made in future cases.  We therefore conclude that a blanket exemption is not required. C. Section 434(e)
 Section 434(e) requires ""[e]very person (other than a political committee or candidate) who makes contributions   or expenditures"" aggregating over $100 in a calendar year ""other than by contribution to a political committee or candidate"" to file a statement with the Commission. [ Footnote 93 ]  Unlike the other disclosure provisions, this section does not seek the contribution list of any association.  Instead, it requires direct disclosure of what an individual or group contributes or spends. In considering this provision, we must apply the same strict standard of scrutiny, for the right of associational privacy developed in  NAACP v. Alabama  derives from the rights of the organization's members to advocate their personal points of view in the most effective way.  357 U.S. at   357 U. S. 458 ,   357 U. S. 460 .   See also NAACP v. Button,  371 U.S. at   371 U. S. 429 -431;  Sweezy v. New Hampshire,  354 U.S. at   354 U. S. 250 . Appellants attack § 434(e) as a direct intrusion on privacy of belief, in violation of  Talley v. California,   362 U. S. 60  (1960), and as imposing ""very real, practical burdens . . . certain to deter individuals from making expenditures for their independent political speech"" analogous to those held to be impermissible in  Thomas v. Collins,   323 U. S. 516  (1945). 1. The Role of § 434(e) The Court of Appeals upheld § 434(e) as necessary to enforce the independent expenditure ceiling imposed by 18 U.S.C. § 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  It ""If . . . Congress has both the authority and a compelling interest to regulate independent expenditures under section 608(e), surely it can require that there be disclosure to prevent misuse of the spending channel."" 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 220 519 F.2d  at 869.  We have found that § 608(e)(1) unconstitutionally in   fringes upon First Amendment rights. [ Footnote 94 ]  If the sole function of § 434(e) were to aid in the enforcement of that provision, it would no longer serve any governmental purpose. But the two provisions are not so intimately tied.  The legislative history on the function of § 434(e) is bare, but it was clearly intended to stand independently of § 608(e)(1).  It was enacted with the general disclosure provisions in 1971 as part of the original Act, [ Footnote 95 ] while § 608(e)(1) was part of the 1974 amendments. [ Footnote 96 ]  Like the other disclosure provisions, § 434(e) could play a role in the enforcement of the expanded contribution and expenditure limitations included in the 1974 amendments, but it also has independent functions.  Section 434(e) is part of Congress' effort to achieve ""total disclosure"" by reaching ""every kind of political activity"" [ Footnote 97 ] in order to insure that the voters are fully informed and to achieve through publicity the maximum deterrence to corruption and undue influence possible.  The provision is responsive to the legitimate fear that efforts would be made, as they had been in the past, [ Footnote 98 ] to avoid the disclosure requirements by routing financial support of candidates through avenues not explicitly covered by the general provisions of the Act. 2. Vagueness Problems In its effort to be all-inclusive, however, the provision raises serious problems of vagueness, particularly treacherous where, as here, the violation of its terms carries criminal penalties [ Footnote 99 ] and fear of incurring these sanctions   may deter those who seek to exercise protected First Amendment rights. Section 434(e) applies to ""[e]very person. . . who makes contributions or expenditures.""  ""Contributions"" and ""expenditures"" are defined in parallel provisions in terms of the use of money or other valuable assets ""for the purpose of . . . influencing"" the nomination or election of candidates for federal office. [ Footnote 100 ]  It is the ambiguity of this phrase that poses constitutional problems. Due process requires that a criminal statute provide adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that his contemplated conduct is illegal, for ""no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.""   United States v. Harriss,   347 U. S. 612 ,   347 U. S. 617  (1954).   See also Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville,   405 U. S. 156  (1972).  Where First Amendment rights are involved, an even ""greater degree of specificity"" is required.   Smith v. Goguen,  415 U.S. at   415 U. S. 573 .   See Grayned v. City of Rockford,   408 U. S. 104 ,   408 U. S. 109  (1972);  Kunz v. New York,   340 U. S. 290  (1951). There is no legislative history to guide us in determining the scope of the critical phrase ""for the purpose of . . . influencing.""  It appears to have been adopted without comment from earlier disclosure Acts. [ Footnote 101 ]  Congress ""has voiced its wishes in [most] muted strains,"" leaving us to draw upon ""those common sense assumptions that must be made in determining direction without a compass.""   Rosado v. Wyman,   397 U. S. 397 ,   397 U. S. 412  (1970).  Where the constitutional requirement of definiteness is at stake, we have the further obligation to construe the statute,   if that can be done consistent with the legislature's purpose, to avoid the shoals of vagueness.   United States v. Harriss, supra  at   347 U. S. 618 ;  United States v. Rumely,  345 U.S. at   345 U. S. 45 . In enacting the legislation under review, Congress addressed broadly the problem of political campaign financing.  It wished to promote full disclosure of campaign-oriented spending to insure both the reality and the appearance of the purity and openness of the federal election process. [ Footnote 102 ]  Our task is to construe ""for the purpose of . . . influencing,"" incorporated in § 434(e) through the definitions of ""contributions"" and ""expenditures,"" in a manner that precisely furthers this goal. In   424 U. S.    we discussed what constituted a ""contribution"" for purposes of the contribution limitations set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 608(b) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). [ Footnote 103 ]  We construed that term to include not only contributions made directly or indirectly to a candidate, political party, or campaign committee, and contributions made to other organizations or individuals but earmarked for political purposes, but also all expenditures placed in cooperation with or with the consent of a candidate, his agents, or an authorized committee of the candidate.  The definition of ""contribution"" in § 431(e), for disclosure purposes, parallels the definition in Title 18 almost word for word, and we construe the former provision as we have the latter.  So defined, ""contributions"" have a sufficiently close relationship to the goals of the Act, for they are connected with a candidate or his campaign. When we attempt to define ""expenditure"" in a similarly narrow way, we encounter line-drawing problems   of the sort we faced in 18 U.S.C. § 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Although the phrase, ""for the purpose of . . . influencing"" an election or nomination, differs from the language used in § 608(e)(1), it shares the same potential for encompassing both issue discussion and advocacy of a political result. [ Footnote 104 ]  The general requirement that ""political committees"" and candidates disclose their expenditures could raise similar vagueness problems, for ""political committee"" is defined only in terms of amount of annual ""contributions"" and ""expenditures,"" [ Footnote 105 ] and could be interpreted to reach groups engaged purely in issue discussion.  The lower courts have construed the words ""political committee"" more narrowly. [ Footnote 106 ]  To fulfill the purposes of the Act, they need only encompass organizations that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate.  Expenditures of candidates and of ""political committees,"" so construed, can be assumed to fall within the core area sought to be addressed by Congress.  They are, by definition, campaign-related. But when the maker of the expenditure is not within these categories -- when it is an individual other than a candidate or a group other than a ""political committee"" [ Footnote 107 ]   -- the relation of the information sought to the purposes of the Act may be too remote.  To insure that the reach of § 434(e) is not impermissibly broad, we construe ""expenditure"" for purposes of that section in the same way we construed the terms of § 608(e) -- to reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate [ Footnote 108 ] the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.  This reading is directed precisely to that spending that is unambiguously related to the campaign of a particular federal candidate. In summary, § 434(e), as construed, imposes independent reporting requirements on individuals and groups that are not candidates or political committees only in the following circumstances:  (1) when they make contributions earmarked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent, to some person other than a candidate or political committee, and (2) when they make expenditures for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. Unlike 18 U.S.C. § 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), § 434(e), as construed, bears a sufficient relationship to a substantial governmental interest.  As narrowed, § 434(e), like § 608(e)(1), does not reach all partisan discussion, for it only requires disclosure of those expenditures that expressly advocate a particular election result.  This might have been fatal if the only purpose of § 434(e)   were to stem corruption or its appearance by closing a loophole in the general disclosure requirements.  But the disclosure provisions, including § 434(e), serve another, informational interest, and, even as construed, § 434(e) increases the fund of information concerning those who support the candidates.  It goes beyond the general disclosure requirements to shed the light of publicity on spending that is unambiguously campaign-related, but would not otherwise be reported because it takes the form of independent expenditures or of contributions to an individual or group not itself required to report the names of its contributors.  By the same token, it is not fatal that § 434(e) encompasses purely independent expenditures uncoordinated with a particular candidate or his agent.  The corruption potential of these expenditures may be significantly different, but the informational interest can be as strong as it is in coordinated spending, for disclosure helps voters to define more of the candidates' constituencies. Section 434(e), as we have construed it, does not contain the infirmities of the provisions before the Court in  Talley v. California,   362 U. S. 60  (1960), and  Thomas v. Collins,   323 U. S. 516  (1945).  The ordinance found wanting in  Talley  forbade all distribution of handbills that did not contain the name of the printer, author, or manufacturer, and the name of the distributor.  The city urged that the ordinance was aimed at identifying those responsible for fraud, false advertising, and libel, but the Court found that it was ""in no manner so limited.""  362 U.S. at   362 U. S. 64 .  Here, as we have seen, the disclosure requirement is narrowly limited to those situations where the information sought has a substantial connection with the governmental interests sought to be advanced.   Thomas  held unconstitutional a prior restraint in the form of a registration requirement for labor organizers.    The Court found the State's interest insufficient to justify the restrictive effect of the statute.  The burden imposed by § 434(e) is no prior restraint, but a reasonable and minimally restrictive method of furthering First Amendment values by opening the basic processes of our federal election system to public view. [ Footnote 109 ] D. Thresholds
 Appellants' third contention, based on alleged overbreadth, is that the monetary thresholds in the recordkeeping and reporting provisions lack a substantial nexus with the claimed governmental interests, for the amounts involved are too low even to attract the attention of the candidate, much less have a corrupting influence. The provisions contain two thresholds.  Records are to be kept by political committees of the names and addresses of those who make contributions in excess of $10, § 432(c)(2), and these records are subject to Commission audit, § 438(a)(8).  If a person's contributions to a committee or candidate aggregate more than $100, his name and address, as well as his occupation and principal place of business, are to be included in reports filed by committees and candidates with the Commission, § 434(b)(2), and made available for public inspection, § 438(a)(4). The Court of Appeals rejected appellants' contention that these thresholds are unconstitutional.  It found the challenge on First Amendment grounds to the $10 threshold to be premature, for it could ""discern no basis in the statute for authorizing disclosure outside the Commission . . . ;   and hence no substantial  inhibitory effect' operating upon"" appellants.  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 216, 519 F.2d  at 865.  The $100 threshold was found to be within the ""reasonable latitude"" given the legislature ""as to where to draw the line.""   Ibid.   We agree.
 The $10 and $100 thresholds are indeed low.  Contributors of relatively small amounts are likely to be especially sensitive to recording or disclosure of their political preferences.  These strict requirements may well discourage participation by some citizens in the political process, a result that Congress hardly could have intended.  Indeed, there is little in the legislative history to indicate that Congress focused carefully on the appropriate level at which to require recording and disclosure.  Rather, it seems merely to have adopted the thresholds existing in similar disclosure laws since 1910. [ Footnote 110 ]  But we cannot require Congress to establish that it has chosen the highest reasonable threshold.  The line is necessarily a judgmental decision, best left in the context of this complex legislation to congressional discretion.  We cannot say, on this bare record, that the limits designated are wholly without rationality. [ Footnote 111 ] We are mindful that disclosure serves informational functions, as well as the prevention of corruption and the enforcement of the contribution limitations.  Congress is not required to set a threshold that is tailored only to the latter goals.  In addition, the enforcement   goal can never be well served if the threshold is so high that disclosure becomes equivalent to admitting violation of the contribution limitations. The $10 recordkeeping threshold, in a somewhat similar fashion, facilitates the enforcement of the disclosure provisions by making it relatively difficult to aggregate secret contributions in amounts that surpass the $100 limit.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that there is no warrant for assuming that public disclosure of contributions between $10 and $100 is authorized by the Act.  Accordingly, we do not reach the question whether information concerning gifts of this size can be made available to the public without trespassing impermissibly on First Amendment rights.   Cf. California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz,  416 U.S. at   416 U. S. 56 -57. [ Footnote 112 ] In summary, we find no constitutional infirmities in the recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure provisions of the Act. [ Footnote 113 ]  III . PUBLIC FINANCING OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS A series of statutes [ Footnote 114 ] for the public financing of Presidential election campaigns produced the scheme now found in § 6096 and Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue   Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. §§ 6096, 9001-9012, 9031-9042 (1970 ed., Supp. IV). [ Footnote 115 ]  Both the District Court,  401 F. Supp. 1235 , and the Court of Appeals, 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 229-238, 519 F.2d  at 878-887, sustained Subtitle H against a constitutional attack. [ Footnote 116 ]  Appellants renew their challenge here, contending that the legislation violates the First and Fifth Amendments.  We find no merit in their claims and affirm. A. Summary of Subtitle H
 Section 9006 establishes a Presidential Election Campaign Fund (Fund), financed from general revenues in the aggregate amount designated by individual taxpayers, under § 6096, who on their income tax returns may authorize payment to the Fund of one dollar of their tax liability in the case of an individual return or two dollars in the case of a joint return.  The Fund consists of three separate accounts to finance (1) party nominating conventions, § 9008(a), (2) general election campaigns, § 9006(a), and (3) primary campaigns, § 9037(a). [ Footnote 117 ]  Chapter 95 of Title 26 which concerns financing of party nominating conventions and general election campaigns, distinguishes among ""major,"" ""minor,"" and ""new"" parties.  A major party is defined as a party whose candidate for President in the most recent election received 25% or more of the popular vote.  § 9002(6).  A minor party is defined as a party whose candidate received at least 5% but less than 25% of the vote at the most recent election.  § 9002(7).  All other parties are new parties, § 9002(8), including both newly created parties and those receiving less than 5% of the vote in the last election. [ Footnote 118 ] Major parties are entitled to $2,000,000 to defray their national committee Presidential nominating convention expenses, must limit total expenditures to that amount, § 9008(d), [ Footnote 119 ] and may not use any of this money to benefit a particular candidate or delegate, § 9008(c).    A minor party receives a portion of the major party entitlement determined by the ratio of the votes received by the party's candidate in the last election to the average of the votes received by the major parties' candidates.  § 9008(b)(2).  The amounts given to the parties and the expenditure limit are adjusted for inflation, using 1974 as the base year.  § 9008(b)(5).  No financing is provided for new parties, nor is there any express provision for financing independent candidates or parties not holding a convention. For expenses in the general election campaign, § 9004(a)(1) entitles each major party candidate to $20,000,000. [ Footnote 120 ]  This amount is also adjusted for inflation.   See  § 9004(a)(1).  To be eligible for funds the candidate [ Footnote 121 ] must pledge not to incur expenses in excess of the entitlement under § 9004(a)(1) and not to accept private contributions except to the extent that the fund is insufficient to provide the full entitlement.  § 9003(b).  Minor party candidates are also entitled to funding, again based on the ratio of the vote received by the party's candidate in the preceding election to the average of the major party candidates.  § 9004(a)(2)(A). Minor party candidates must certify that they will not incur campaign expenses in excess of the major party entitlement and   that they will accept private contributions only to the extent needed to make up the difference between that amount and the public funding grant.  § 9003(c).  New party candidates receive no money prior to the general election, but any candidate receiving 5% or more of the popular vote in the election is entitled to post-election payments according to the formula applicable to minor party candidates.  § 9004(a)(3).  Similarly, minor party candidates are entitled to post-election funds if they receive a greater percentage of the average major party vote than their party's candidate did in the preceding election; the amount of such payments is the difference between the entitlement based on the preceding election and that based on the actual vote in the current election.  § 9004(a)(3).  A further eligibility requirement for minor and new party candidates is that the candidate's name must appear on the ballot, or electors pledged to the candidate must be on the ballot, in at least 10 States.  § 9002(2)(b). Chapter 96 establishes a third account in the Fund, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account.  § 9037(a).  This funding is intended to aid campaigns by candidates seeking Presidential nomination ""by a political party,"" § 9033(b)(2), in ""primary elections,"" § 9032(7). [ Footnote 122 ]  The threshold eligibility requirement is that the candidate raise at least $5,000 in each of 20 States, counting only the first $250 from each person contributing to the candidate.  §§ 9033(b)(3), (4).  In addition, the candidate must agree to abide by the spending limits in § 9035.   See  § 9033(b)(1). [ Footnote 123 ]  Funding is   provided according to a matching formula:  each qualified candidate is entitled to a sum equal to the total private contributions received, disregarding contributions from any person to the extent that total contributions to the candidate by that person exceed $250.  § 9034(a).  Payments to any candidate under Chapter 96 may not exceed 50% of the over-all expenditure ceiling accepted by the candidate. § 9034(b). B. Constitutionality of Subtitle H
 Appellants argue that Subtitle H is invalid (1) as ""contrary to the  general welfare,'"" Art. I, § 8, (2) because any scheme of public financing of election campaigns is inconsistent with the First Amendment, and (3) because Subtitle H invidiously discriminates against certain interests in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  We find no merit in these contentions.
 Appellants' ""general welfare"" contention erroneously treats the General Welfare Clause as a limitation upon congressional power.  It is rather a grant of power, the scope of which is quite expansive, particularly in view of the enlargement of power by the Necessary and Proper Clause.   M'Culloch v. Maryland ,  4 Wheat. 316,   17 U. S. 420  (1819).  Congress has power to regulate Presidential elections and primaries,  United States v. Classic,   313 U. S. 299  (1941);  Burroughs v. United States,   290 U. S. 534  (1934); and public financing of Presidential elections as a means to reform the electoral process was clearly a choice within the granted power.  It is for Congress to decide which expenditures will promote the general welfare: ""[T]he power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not   limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution."" United States v. Butler,   297 U. S. 1 ,   297 U. S. 66  (1936).   See Helvering v. Davis,   301 U. S. 619 ,   301 U. S. 640 -641 (1937).  Any limitations upon the exercise of that granted power must be found elsewhere in the Constitution.  In this case, Congress was legislating for the ""general welfare"" -- to reduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on our political process, to facilitate communication by candidates with the electorate, and to free candidates from the rigors of fundraising.   See  S.Rep. No. 9689, pp. 1-10 (1974).  Whether the chosen means appear ""bad,"" ""unwise,"" or ""unworkable"" to us is irrelevant; Congress has concluded that the means are ""necessary and proper"" to promote the general welfare, and we thus decline to find this legislation without the grant of power in Art. I, § 8. Appellants' challenge to the dollar check-off provision (§ 6096) fails for the same reason.  They maintain that Congress is required to permit taxpayers to designate particular candidates or parties as recipients of their money.  But the appropriation to the Fund in § 9006 is like any other appropriation from the general revenue except that its amount is determined by reference to the aggregate of the one- and two-dollar authorization on taxpayers' income tax returns.  This detail does not constitute the appropriation any less an appropriation by Congress. [ Footnote 124 ]  The fallacy of appellants' argument is therefore apparent;   every appropriation made by Congress uses public money in a manner to which some taxpayers object. [ Footnote 125 ]  Appellants next argue that, ""by analogy"" to the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, public financing of election campaigns, however meritorious, violates the First Amendment.  We have, of course, held that the Religion Clauses -- ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" -- require Congress, and the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, to remain neutral in matters of religion.   E.g., Abington School Dist. v. Schempp,   374 U. S. 203 ,   374 U. S. 222 -226 (1963).  The government may not aid one religion to the detriment of others or impose a burden on one religion that is not imposed on others, and may not even aid all religions.   E.g., Everson v. Board of Education,   330 U. S. 1 ,   330 U. S. 15 -16 (1947).   See  Kurland, Of Church and State and the Supreme Court, 29 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1, 96 (1961).  But the analogy is patently inapplicable to our issue here.  Although ""Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,"" Subtitle H is a congressional effort not to abridge, restrict, or censor speech, but rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public   discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a self-governing people. [ Footnote 126 ]  Thus, Subtitle H furthers, not abridges, pertinent First Amendment values. [ Footnote 127 ]  Appellants argue, however, that as constructed public financing invidiously discriminates in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  We turn therefore to that argument. Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.   Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld,   420 U. S. 636 ,   420 U. S. 638  n. 2 (1975), and cases cited. In several situations concerning the electoral process, the principle has been   developed that restrictions on access to the electoral process must survive exacting scrutiny.  The restriction can be sustained only if it furthers a ""vial"" governmental interest,  American Party of Texas v. White,   415 U. S. 767 ,   415 U. S. 780 -781 (1974), that is ""achieved by a means that does not unfairly or unnecessarily burden either a minority party's or an individual candidate's equally important interest in the continued availability of political opportunity."" Lubin v. Panish,   415 U. S. 709 ,   415 U. S. 716  (1974).   See American Party of Texas v. White, supra,  at   415 U. S. 780 ;  Storer v. Brown,   415 U. S. 724 ,   415 U. S. 729 -730 (1974).  These cases, however, dealt primarily with state laws requiring a candidate to satisfy certain requirements in order to have his name appear on the ballot.  These were, of course, direct burdens not only on the candidate's ability to run for office, but also on the voter's ability to voice preferences regarding representative government and contemporary issues.  In contrast, the denial of public financing to some Presidential candidates is not restrictive of voters' rights and less restrictive of candidates'. [ Footnote 128 ]  Subtitle H does not prevent any candidate from getting on the ballot or any voter from casting a vote for the candidate of his choice; the inability, if any, of minor party candidates to wage effective campaigns will derive not from lack of public funding but from their inability to   raise private contributions.  Any disadvantage suffered by operation of the eligibility formulae under Subtitle H is thus limited to the claimed denial of the enhancement of opportunity to communicate with the electorate that the formulae afford eligible candidates.  But eligible candidates suffer a countervailing denial.  As we more fully develop later, acceptance of public financing entails voluntary acceptance of an expenditure ceiling.  Noneligible candidates are not subject to that limitation. [ Footnote 129 ]  Accordingly, we conclude that public financing is generally less restrictive of access to the electoral process than the ballot-access regulations dealt with in prior cases. [ Footnote 130 ]  In any event, Congress enacted Subtitle H in furtherance of sufficiently important governmental interests and has   not unfairly or unnecessarily burdened the political opportunity of any party or candidate. It cannot be gainsaid that public financing as a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.  S.Rep. No. 93-689, pp. 4-5 (1974).  In addition, the limits on contributions necessarily increase the burden of fundraising, and Congress properly regarded public financing as an appropriate means of relieving major party Presidential candidates from the rigors of soliciting private contributions.   See id.  at 5.  The States have also been held to have important interests in limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who demonstrate substantial popular support.   E.g., Storer v. Brown, supra  at   415 U. S. 736 ;  Lubin v. Panish, supra  at   415 U. S. 718 -719;  Jenness v. Fortson,   403 U. S. 431 ,   403 U. S. 442  (1971);  Williams v. Rhodes,  393 U.S. at   393 U. S. 31 -33.  Congress' interest in not funding hopeless candidacies with large sums of public money, S.Rep. No. 93-689,  supra  at 7, necessarily justifies the withholding of public assistance from candidates without significant public support.  Thus, Congress may legitimately require ""some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support,""  Jenness v. Fortson, supra  at   403 U. S. 442 , as an eligibility requirement for public funds.  This requirement also serves the important public interest against providing artificial incentives to ""splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism.""   Storer v. Brown, supra  at   415 U. S. 736 ; S.Rep. No. 93-689,  supra  at 8; H.R.Rep. No. 93-1239, p. 13 (1974).   Cf. Bullock v. Carter,   405 U. S. 134 ,   405 U. S. 145  (1972). At the same time Congress recognized the constitutional restraints against inhibition of the present opportunity of minor parties to become major political entities if they obtain widespread support.  S.Rep. No. 93-689,  supra  at   424 U. S. 8 -10; H.R.Rep. No. 93-1239,  supra,  at 13.  As   the Court of Appeals said, ""provisions for public funding of Presidential campaigns . . . could operate to give an unfair advantage to established parties, thus reducing, to the nation's detriment, . . . the 'potential fluidity of American political life.'"" 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 231, 519 F.2d  at 880, quoting from  Jenness v. Fortson, supra  at   403 U. S. 439 . 1. General Election Campaign Financing Appellants insist that Chapter 95 falls short of the constitutional requirement in that its provisions supply larger, and equal, sums to candidates of major parties, use prior vote levels as the sole criterion for pre-election funding, limit new party candidates to post-election funds, and deny any funds to candidates of parties receiving less than 5% of the vote.  These provisions, it is argued, are fatal to the validity of the scheme, because they work invidious discrimination against minor and new parties in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  We disagree. [ Footnote 131 ] As conceded by appellants, the Constitution does not require Congress to treat all declared candidates the same for public financing purposes.  As we said in  Jenness v. Fortson, ""there are obvious differences in kind between the needs and potentials of a political party with historically established broad support, on the one hand, and a new or small political organization on the other. . . .  Sometimes the grossest discrimination can lie in treating   things that are different as though they were exactly alike, a truism well illustrated in  Williams v. Rhodes, supra. "" 403 U.S. at   403 U. S. 441 -442.  Since the Presidential elections of 1856 and 1860, when the Whigs were replaced as a major party by the Republicans, no third party has posed a credible threat to the two major parties in Presidential elections. [ Footnote 132 ]  Third parties have been completely incapable of matching the major parties' ability to raise money and win elections.  Congress was, of course, aware of this fact of American life, and thus was justified in providing both major parties full funding and all other parties only a percentage of the major party entitlement. [ Footnote 133 ]  Identical treatment of all parties, on the other hand, ""would not only make it easy to raid the United States Treasury, it would also artificially foster the proliferation of splinter parties.""  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 231, 519 F.2d  at 881.  The Constitution does not require the Government to ""finance the efforts of every nascent political group,""  American Party of Texas v. White,  415 U.S. at   415 U. S. 794 , merely because Congress chose to finance the efforts of the major parties. Furthermore, appellants have made no showing that   the election funding plan disadvantages nonmajor parties by operating to reduce their strength below that attained without any public financing.  First, such parties are free to raise money from private sources, [ Footnote 134 ] and, by our holding today, new parties are freed from any expenditure limits, although admittedly those limits may be a largely academic matter to them.  But since any major party candidate accepting public financing of a campaign voluntarily assents to a spending ceiling, other candidates will be able to spend more in relation to the major party candidates.  The relative position of minor parties that do qualify to receive some public funds because they received 5% of the vote in the previous Presidential election is also enhanced.  Public funding for candidates of major parties is intended as a substitute for private contributions; but for minor party candidates [ Footnote 135 ] such assistance may be viewed as a supplement to private contributions since these candidates may continue to solicit private funds up to the applicable spending limit.  Thus, we conclude that the general election funding system does not work an invidious discrimination against candidates of nonmajor parties. Appellants challenge reliance on the vote in past elections as the basis for determining eligibility.  That challenge is foreclosed, however, by our holding in  Jenness v. Fortson,  403 U.S. at   403 U. S. 439 -440, that popular vote totals in the last election are a proper measure of public support.    And Congress was not obliged to select instead from among appellants' suggested alternatives.  Congress could properly regard the means chosen as preferable, since the alternative of petition drives presents cost and administrative problems in validating signatures, and the alternative of opinion polls might be thought inappropriate, since it would involve a Government agency in the business of certifying polls or conducting its own investigation of support for various candidates, in addition to serious problems with reliability. [ Footnote 136 ] Appellants next argue, relying on the ballot access decisions of this Court, that the absence of any alternative means of obtaining pre-election funding renders the scheme unjustifiably restrictive of minority political interests.  Appellants' reliance on the ballot access decisions is misplaced.  To be sure, the regulation sustained in  Jenness v. Fortson,  for example, incorporated alternative means of qualifying for the ballot, 403 U.S. at   403 U. S. 440 , and the lack of an alternative was a defect in the scheme struck down in  Lubin v. Panish,  415 U.S. at   415 U. S. 718 .  To   suggest, however, that the constitutionality of Subtitle H therefore hinges solely on whether some alternative is afforded overlooks the rationale of the operative constitutional principles.  Our decisions finding a need for an alternative means turn on the nature and extent of the burden imposed in the absence of available alternatives.  We have earlier stated our view that Chapter 95 is far less burdensome upon and restrictive of constitutional rights than the regulations involved in the ballot access cases.   See supra  at   424 U. S. 94 -95.  Moreover, expenditure limits for major parties and candidates may well improve the chances of nonmajor parties and their candidates to receive funds and increase their spending.  Any risk of harm to minority interests is speculative due to our present lack of knowledge of the practical effects of public financing and cannot overcome the force of the governmental interests against use of public money to foster frivolous candidacies, create a system of splintered parties, and encourage unrestrained factionalism. Appellants' reliance on the alternative means analyses of the ballot access cases generally fails to recognize a significant distinction from the instant case.  The primary goal of all candidates is to carry on a successful campaign by communicating to the voters persuasive reasons for electing them.  In some of the ballot access cases, the States afforded candidates alternative means for qualifying for the ballot, a step in any campaign that, with rare exceptions, is essential to successful effort.  Chapter 95 concededly provides only one method of obtaining pre-election financing; such funding is, however, not as necessary as being on the ballot.   See   n  128,  supra.   Plainly, campaigns can be successfully carried out by means other than public financing; they have been up to this date, and this avenue is still open to all candidates.  And, after all, the important achievements of minority   political groups in furthering the development of American democracy [ Footnote 137 ] were accomplished without the help of public funds.  Thus, the limited participation or nonparticipation of nonmajor parties or candidates in public funding does not unconstitutionally disadvantage them. Of course, nonmajor parties and their candidates may qualify for post-election participation in public funding and in that sense the claimed discrimination is not total.  Appellants contend, however that the benefit of any such participation is illusory due to § 9004(c), which bars the use of the money for any purpose other than paying campaign expenses or repaying loans that had been used to defray such expenses.  The only meaningful use for post-election funds is thus to repay loans; but loans, except from national banks, are ""contributions"" subject to the general limitations on contributions, 18 U.S.C. § 591(e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Further, they argue, loans are not readily available to nonmajor parties or candidates before elections to finance their campaigns.  Availability of post-election funds therefore assertedly gives them nothing.  But, in the nature of things, the willingness of lenders to make loans will depend upon the pre-election probability that the candidate and his party will attract 5% or more of the voters.  When a reasonable prospect of such support appears, the party and candidate may be an acceptable loan risk, since the prospect of post-election participation in public funding will be good. [ Footnote 138 ]  Finally, appellants challenge the validity of the 50% threshold requirement for general election funding.  They argue that, since most state regulations governing ballot access have threshold requirements well below 50%, and because, in their view, the 50% requirement here is actually stricter than that upheld in  Jenness v. Fortson,   403 U. S. 431  (1971), [ Footnote 139 ] the requirement is unreasonable.  We have already concluded that the restriction under Chapter 95 is generally less burdensome than ballot access regulations.   Supra  at   424 U. S. 94 -95.  Further, the Georgia provision sustained in  Jenness  required the candidate to obtain the signatures of 70% of all eligible voters, without regard to party.  To be sure, the public funding formula does not permit anyone who voted for another party in the last election to be part of a candidate's 5%.  But, under Chapter 95, a Presidential candidate needs only 5% or more of the actual vote, not the larger universe of eligible voters.  As a result, we cannot say that Chapter 95 is numerically more, or less, restrictive than the regulation in  Jenness.   In any event, the choice of the percentage requirement that best accommodates the competing interests involved was for Congress to make.   See Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman,   277 U. S. 32 ,   277 U. S. 41  (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting);   n  111,  supra.   Without any doubt, a range of formulations would sufficiently protect the public fisc and not foster factionalism, and would also recognize the public interest in the fluidity of our political   affairs:  we cannot say that Congress' choice falls without the permissible range. [ Footnote 140 ] 2. Nominating Convention Financing The foregoing analysis and reasoning sustaining general election funding apply in large part to convention funding under Chapter 95 and suffice to support our rejection of appellants' challenge to these provisions.  Funding of party conventions has increasingly been derived from large private contributions,  see  H.R.Rep. No. 93-1239, p. 14 (1974), and the governmental interest in eliminating this reliance is as vital as in the case of private contributions to individual candidates.  The expenditure limitations on major parties participating in public financing enhance the ability of nonmajor parties to increase their spending relative to the major parties; further, in soliciting private contributions to finance conventions, parties are not subject to the $1,000 contribution limit pertaining to candidates. [ Footnote 141 ]  We therefore conclude that appellants' constitutional challenge to the   provisions for funding nominating conventions must also be rejected. 3. Primary Election Campaign Financing Appellants' final challenge is to the constitutionality of Chapter 96, which provides funding of primary campaigns.  They contend that these provisions are constitutionally invalid (1) because they do not provide funds for candidates not running in party primaries [ Footnote 142 ] and (2) because the eligibility formula actually increases the influence of money on the electoral process.  In not providing assistance to candidates who do not enter party primaries, Congress has merely chosen to limit at this time the reach of the reforms encompassed in Chapter 96.  This Congress could do without constituting the reforms a constitutionally invidious discrimination.  The governing principle was stated in  Katzenbach v. Morgan,   384 U. S. 641 ,   384 U. S. 657  (1966): ""[I]n deciding the constitutional propriety of the limitations in such a reform measure, we are guided by the familiar principles that a 'statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did,'  Roschen v. Ward,   279 U. S. 337 ,   279 U. S. 339 , that a legislature need not 'strike at all evils at the same time,'  Semler v. Dental Examiners,   294 U. S. 608 ,   294 U. S. 610 , and that 'reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind,'  Williamson v. Lee Optical Co.,   348 U. S. 483 ,   348 U. S. 489 . [ Footnote 143 ]    The choice to limit matching funds to candidates running in primaries may reflect that concern about large private contributions to candidates centered on primary races and that there is no historical evidence of similar abuses involving contributions to candidates who engage in petition drives to qualify for state ballots.  Moreover, assistance to candidates and nonmajor parties forced to resort to petition drives to gain ballot access implicates the policies against fostering frivolous candidacies, creating a system of splintered parties, and encouraging unrestrained factionalism."" The eligibility requirements in Chapter 96 are surely not an unreasonable way to measure popular support for a candidate, accomplishing the objective of limiting subsidization to those candidates with a substantial chance of being nominated.  Counting only the first $250 of each contribution for eligibility purposes requires candidates to solicit smaller contributions from numerous people.  Requiring the money to come from citizens of a minimum number of States eliminates candidates whose appeal is limited geographically; a President is elected not by popular vote, but by winning the popular vote in enough States to have a majority in the Electoral College. [ Footnote 144 ]  We also reject as without merit appellants' argument that the matching formula favors wealthy voters and candidates.  The thrust of the legislation is to reduce financial barriers [ Footnote 145 ] and to enhance the importance of smaller contributions. [ Footnote 146 ]  Some candidates undoubtedly could raise large sums of money, and thus have little need for public funds, but candidates with lesser fundraising capabilities will gain substantial benefits from matching funds.  In addition, one eligibility requirement for   matching funds is acceptance of an expenditure ceiling, and candidates with little fundraising ability will be able to increase their spending relative to candidates capable of raising large amounts in private funds. For the reasons stated, we reject appellants' claims that Subtitle H is facially unconstitutional. [ Footnote 147 ] C. Severability
 The only remaining issue is whether our holdings invalidating 18 U.S.C. §§ 608(a), (c), and ()(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) require the conclusion that Subtitle H is unconstitutional.  There is, of course, a relationship between the spending limits in § 608(c) and the public financing provisions; the expenditure limits accepted by a candidate to be eligible for public funding are identical to the limits in § 608(c).  But we have no difficulty in concluding that Subtitle H is severable. ""Unless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law."" Champlin     Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission,   286 U. S. 210 ,   286 U. S. 234  (1932).  Our discussion of ""what is left"" leaves no doubt that the value of public financing is not dependent on the existence of a generally applicable expenditure limit.  We therefore hold Subtitle H severable from those portions of the legislation today held constitutionally infirm. IV . THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION The 1974 amendments to the Act create an eight-member Federal Election Commission (Commission) and vest in it primary and substantial responsibility for administering and enforcing the Act.  The question that we address in this portion of the opinion is whether, in view of the manner in which a majority of its members are appointed, the Commission may, under the Constitution, exercise the powers conferred upon it.  We find it unnecessary to parse the complex statutory provisions in order to sketch the full sweep of the Commission's authority.  It will suffice for present purposes to describe what appear to be representative examples of its various powers. Chapter 14 of Title 2. [ Footnote 148 ] makes the Commission the principal repository of the numerous reports and statements which are required by that chapter to be filed by those engaging in the regulated political activities.  Its duties under § 438(a) with respect to these reports and statements include filing and indexing, making them available for public inspection, preservation, and auditing and field investigations.  It is directed to ""serve as a national clearinghouse for information in respect to the administration of elections.""  § 438(b).  Beyond these recordkeeping, disclosure, and investigative functions, however, the Commission is given extensive rulemaking and adjudicative powers.  Its duty under § 438(a)(10) is ""to prescribe suitable rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of . . . chapter [14].""  Under § 437d(a)(8), the Commission is empowered to make such rules ""as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."" [ Footnote 149 ]  Section 437d(a)(9) authorizes it to ""formulate general policy with respect to the administration of this Act"" and enumerated sections of Title 18's Criminal Code, [ Footnote 150 ] as to all of which provisions the Commission ""has primary jurisdiction with respect to [their] civil enforcement.""  § 437c(b). [ Footnote 151 ]  The Commission is authorized under § 437f(a) to render advisory opinions with respect to activities possibly violating the Act, the Title 18 sections, or the campaign funding provisions of Title 26, [ Footnote 152 ] the effect of which is that, ""[n]otwithstanding   any other provision of law, any person with respect to whom an advisory opinion is rendered . . . who acts in good faith in accordance with the provisions and findings [thereof] shall be presumed to be in compliance with the [statutory provision] with respect to which such advisory opinion is rendered."" § 437f(b).  In the course of administering the provisions for Presidential campaign financing, the Commission may authorize convention expenditures which exceed the statutory limits.  26 U.S.C. § 9008(d)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). The Commission's enforcement power is both direct and wide-ranging.  It may institute a civil action for (i) injunctive or other relief against ""any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of this Act,"" § 437g(a)(5); (ii) declaratory or injunctive relief ""as may be appropriate to implement or con[s]true any provisions"" of Chapter 95 of Title 26, governing administration of funds for Presidential election campaigns and national party conventions, 26 U.S.C. § 9011(b)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); and (iii) ""such injunctive relief as is appropriate to implement any provision"" of Chapter 96 of Title 26, governing the payment of matching funds for Presidential primary campaigns, 26 U.S.C. § 9040(c) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  If, after the Commission's post-disbursement audit of candidates receiving payments under Chapter 95 or 96, it finds an overpayment, it is empowered to seek repayment of all funds due the Secretary of the Treasury.  26 U.S.C. §§ 9010(b), 9040(b) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  In no respect do the foregoing civil actions require the concurrence of or participation by the Attorney General; conversely, the decision not to seek judicial relief in the above respects would appear to rest solely with the Commission. [ Footnote 153 ]  With respect to the   referenced Title 18 sections, § 437g(a)(7) provides that, if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing before it, the Commission finds an actual or threatened criminal violation, the Attorney General, ""upon request by the Commission . . . , shall institute a civil action for relief.""  Finally, as ""[a]dditional enforcement authority,"" § 456(a) authorizes the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to make ""a finding that a person . . . while a candidate for Federal office, failed to file"" a required report of contributions or expenditures.  If that finding is made within the applicable limitations period   for prosecutions, the candidate is thereby ""disqualified from becoming a candidate in any future election for Federal office for a period of time beginning on the date of such finding and ending one year after the expiration of the term of the Federal office for which such person was a candidate. [ Footnote 154 ]"" The body in which this authority is reposed consists of eight members. [ Footnote 155 ]  The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives are  ex officio  members of the Commission without the right to vote.  Two members are appointed by the President  pro tempore  of the Senate ""upon the recommendations of the majority leader of the Senate and the minority leader of the Senate."" [ Footnote 156 ]  Two more are to be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, likewise upon the recommendations of its respective majority and minority leaders.  The remaining two members are appointed by the President.  Each of the six voting members of the Commission must be confirmed by the majority of both Houses of Congress, and each of the three appointing authorities is forbidden to choose both of their appointees from the same political party. A. Ripeness
 Appellants argue that given the Commission's extensive powers the method of choosing its members under § 437c(a)(1) runs afoul of the separation of powers embedded in the Constitution, and urge that, as presently constituted, the Commission's ""existence be held unconstitutional by this Court.""  Before embarking on this or any   related inquiry, however, we must decide whether these issues are properly before us.  Because of the Court of Appeals' emphasis on lack of ""ripeness"" of the issue relating to the method of appointment of the members of the Commission, we find it necessary to focus particularly on that consideration in this section of our opinion. We have recently recognized the distinction between jurisdictional limitations imposed by Art. III and ""[p]roblems of prematurity and abstractness"" that may prevent adjudication in all but the exceptional case.   Socialist Labor Party v. Gilligan,   406 U. S. 583 ,   406 U. S. 588  (1972).  In  Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,   419 U. S. 102 ,   419 U. S. 140  (1974), we stated that ""ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing,"" and therefore the passage of months between the time of the decision of the Court of Appeals and our present ruling is, of itself, significant.  We likewise observed in the  Reorganization Act Cases: ""Thus, occurrence of the conveyance allegedly violative of Fifth Amendment rights is in no way hypothetical or speculative.  Where the inevitability of the operation of a statute against certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of a justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the disputed provisions will come into effect."" Id.  at   419 U. S. 143 . The Court of Appeals held that of the five specific certified questions directed at the Commission's authority, only its powers to render advisory opinions and to authorize excessive convention expenditures were ripe for adjudication.  The court held that the remaining aspects of the Commission's authority could not be adjudicated, because, ""[in] its present stance, this litigation does not present the court with the concrete facts that are necessary   to an informed decision."" [ Footnote 157 ] 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 244, 519 F.2d  at 893. Since the entry of judgment by the Court of Appeals,   the Commission has undertaken to issue rules and regulations under the authority of § 438(a)(10).  While many of its other functions remain as yet unexercised, the date of their all but certain exercise is now closer   by several months than it was at the time the Court of Appeals ruled.  Congress was understandably most concerned with obtaining a final adjudication of as many issues as possible litigated pursuant to the provisions of § 437h.  Thus, in order to decide the basic question whether the Act's provision for appointment of the members of the Commission violates the Constitution, we believe we are warranted in considering all of those aspects of the Commission's authority which have been presented by the certified questions. [ Footnote 158 ] Party litigants with sufficient concrete interests at stake may have standing to raise constitutional questions of separation of powers with respect to an agency designated to adjudicate their rights.   Palmore v. United States,   411 U. S. 389  (1973);  Glidden Co. v. Zdanok,   370 U. S. 530  (1962);  Coleman v. Miller,   307 U. S. 433  (1939).  In  Glidden,  of course, the challenged adjudication had already taken place, whereas in this case appellants' claim is of impending future rulings and determinations by the Commission.  But this is a question of ripeness, rather than lack of case or controversy under Art. III, and, for the reasons to which we have previously   adverted we hold that appellants' claims as they bear upon the method of appointment of the Commission's members may be presently adjudicated. B. The Merits
 Appellants urge that, since Congress has given the Commission wide-ranging rulemaking and enforcement powers with respect to the substantive provisions of the Act, Congress is precluded under the principle of separation of powers from vesting in itself the authority to appoint those who will exercise such authority.  Their argument is based on the language of Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which provides in pertinent part as follows: ""[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law:  but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."" Appellants' argument is that this provision is the exclusive method by which those charged with executing the laws of the United States may be chosen.  Congress, they assert, cannot have it both ways.  If the Legislature wishes the Commission to exercise all of the conferred powers, then its members are, in fact, ""Officers of the United States,"" and must be appointed under the Appointments Clause.  But if Congress insists upon retaining the power to appoint, then the members of the Commission may not discharge those many functions of the Commission which can be performed only by ""Officers of   the United States,"" as that term must be construed within the doctrine of separation of powers. Appellee Commission and  amici  in support of the Commission urge that the Framers of the Constitution, while mindful of the need for checks and balances among the three branches of the National Government, had no intention of denying to the Legislative Branch authority to appoint its own officers.  Congress, either under the Appointments Clause or under its grants of substantive legislative authority and the Necessary and Proper Clause in Art. I, is, in their view, empowered to provide for the appointment to the Commission in the manner which it did because the Commission is performing ""appropriate legislative functions."" The majority of the Court of Appeals recognized the importance of the doctrine of separation of powers which is at the heart of our Constitution, and also recognized the principle enunciated in  Springer v. Philippine Islands,   277 U. S. 189  (1928), that the Legislative Branch may not exercise executive authority by retaining the power to appoint those who will execute its laws.  But it described appellants' argument based upon Art. II, § 2, cl. 2 as ""strikingly syllogistic,"" and concluded that Congress had sufficient authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I of the Constitution not only to establish the Commission but to appoint the Commission's members.  As we have earlier noted, it upheld the constitutional validity of congressional vesting of certain authority in the Commission, and concluded that the question of the constitutional validity of the vesting of its remaining functions was not yet ripe for review.  The three dissenting judges in the Court of Appeals concluded that the method of appointment for the Commission did violate the doctrine of separation of powers.  We do not think appellants' arguments based upon Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution may be so easily dismissed as did the majority of the Court of Appeals.  Our inquiry, of necessity, touches upon the fundamental principles of the Government established by the Framers of the Constitution, and all litigants and all of the courts which have addressed themselves to the matter start on common ground in the recognition of the intent of the Framers that the powers of the three great branches of the National Government be largely separate from one another. James Madison, writing in the Federalist No. 47, [ Footnote 159 ] defended the work of the Framers against the charge that these three governmental powers were not entirely separate from one another in the proposed Constitution.  He asserted that, while there was some admixture, the Constitution was nonetheless true to Montesquieu's well known maxim that the legislative, executive, and judicial departments ought to be separate and distinct: ""The reasons on which Montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his meaning.  'When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body,' says he,"" ""there can be no liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest  the same  monarch or senate should  enact  tyrannical laws to  execute  them in a tyrannical manner."" ""Again:"" ""Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for  the judge  would then be  the legislator.   Were it joined to the executive power,  the judge  might behave with all the violence of  an oppressor. "" ""Some of these reasons   are more fully explained in other passages; but, briefly stated as they are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author. [ Footnote 160 ]"" Yet it is also clear from the provisions of the Constitution itself, and from the Federalist Papers, that the Constitution by no means contemplates total separation of each of these three essential branches of Government.  The President is a participant in the lawmaking process by virtue of his authority to veto bills enacted by Congress.  The Senate is a participant in the appointive process by virtue of its authority to refuse to confirm persons nominated to office by the President.  The men who met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 were practical statesmen, experienced in politics, who viewed the principle of separation of powers as a vital check against tyranny.  But they likewise saw that a hermetic sealing off of the three branches of Government from one another would preclude the establishment of a Nation capable of governing itself effectively. Mr. Chief Justice Taft, writing for the Court in  Hampton & Co. v. United States,   276 U. S. 394  (1928), after stating the general principle of separation of powers found in the United States Constitution, went on to observe: ""[T]he rule is that, in the actual administration of the government, Congress or the Legislature should exercise the legislative power, the President or the State executive, the Governor, the executive power, and the Courts or the judiciary the judicial power, and in carrying out that constitutional division into three branches, it is a breach of the National fundamental law if Congress gives up its legislative power   and transfers it to the President, or to the Judicial branch, or if, by law, it attempts to invest itself or its members with either executive power or judicial power.  This is not to say that the three branches are not coordinate parts of one government, and that each, in the field of its duties, may not invoke the action of the two other branches insofar as the action invoked shall not be an assumption of the constitutional field of action of another branch.  In determining what it may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental coordination."" Id.  at   276 U. S. 406 . More recently, Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring in the opinion and the judgment of the Court in  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,   343 U. S. 579 ,   343 U. S. 635  (1952), succinctly characterized this understanding: ""While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government.  It enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity."" The Framers regarded the checks and balances that they had built into the tripartite Federal Government as a self-executing safeguard against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other.  As Madison put it in Federalist No. 51: ""This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public.  We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the   several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other -- that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  These inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the State. [ Footnote 161 ]"" This Court has not hesitated to enforce the principle of separation of powers embodied in the Constitution when its application has proved necessary for the decisions of cases or controversies properly before it.  The Court has held that executive or administrative duties of a nonjudicial nature may not be imposed on judges holding office under Art. III of the Constitution.   United States v. Ferreira ,  13 How. 40 (1852);  Hayburn's Case ,  2 Dall. 409 (1792).  The Court has held that the President may not execute and exercise legislative authority belonging only to Congress.   Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, supra.   In the course of its opinion in that case, the Court said: ""In the framework of our Constitution, the President's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.  The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad.  And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute.  The first section of the first article says that 'All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States. . . .'"" 343 U.S. at   343 U. S. 587 -588.  More closely in point to the facts of the present case is this Court's decision in  Springer v. Philippine Islands,   277 U. S. 189  (1928), where the Court held that the legislature of the Philippine Islands could not provide for legislative appointment to executive agencies. 2. The Appointments Clause The principle of separation of powers was not simply an abstract generalization in the minds of the Framers:  it was woven into the document that they drafted in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.  Article I, § 1, declares:  ""All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.""  Article II, § 1, vests the executive power ""in a President of the United States of America,"" and Art. III, § 1, declares that ""The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."" The further concern of the Framers of the Constitution with maintenance of the separation of powers is found in the so-called ""Ineligibility"" and ""Incompatibility"" Clauses contained in Art. I, § 6: ""No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."" It is in the context of these cognate provisions of the document that we must examine the language of Art. II. § 2, cl. 2, which appellants contend provides the only authorization for appointment of those to whom substantial executive or administrative authority is given   by statute.  Because of the importance of its language, we again set out the provision: ""[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law:  but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers as they think proper in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."" The Appointments Clause could, of course, be read as merely dealing with etiquette or protocol in describing ""Officers of the United States,"" but the drafters had a less frivolous purpose in mind.  This conclusion is supported by language from  United States v. Germaine,   99 U. S. 508 ,   99 U. S. 509 -510 (1879): ""The Constitution, for purposes of appointment, very clearly divides all its officers into two classes.  The primary class requires a nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate.  But foreseeing that, when offices became numerous, and sudden removals necessary, this mode might be inconvenient, it was provided that, in regard to officers inferior to those specially mentioned, Congress might, by law, vest their appointment in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.   That all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government about to be established under the Constitution were intended to be included within one or the other of these modes of appointment there can be but little doubt. "" (Emphasis supplied.)  We think that the term ""Officers of the United States,""   as used in Art. II, defined to include ""all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government"" in  United States v. Germaine, supra,  is a term intended to have substantive meaning.  We think its fair import is that any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States is an ""Officer of the United States,"" and must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by § 2, cl. 2, of that Article. If ""all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government about to be established under the Constitution were intended to be included within one or the other of these modes of appointment,""  United States v. Germaine, supra,  it is difficult to see how the members of the Commission may escape inclusion.  If a postmaster first class,  Myers v. United States,   272 U. S. 52  (1926), and the clerk of a district court,  Ex parte Hennen ,  13 Pet. 230 (1839), are inferior officers of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, as they are, surely the Commissioners before us are, at the very least, such ""inferior Officers"" within the meaning of that Clause. [ Footnote 162 ] Although two members of the Commission are initially selected by the President, his nominations are subject to confirmation not merely by the Senate, but by the House of Representatives as well.  The remaining four voting members of the Commission are appointed by the President  pro tempore  of the Senate and by the Speaker of the House.  While the second part of the Clause   authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of the officers described in that part in ""the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments,"" neither the Speaker of the House nor the President  pro tempore  of the Senate comes within this language. The phrase ""Heads of Departments,"" used as it is in conjunction with the phrase ""Courts of Law,"" suggests that the Departments referred to are themselves in the Executive Branch or at least have some connection with that branch.  While the Clause expressly authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of certain officers in the ""Courts of Law,"" the absence of similar language to include Congress must mean that neither Congress nor its officers were included within the language ""Heads of Departments"" in this part of cl. 2. Thus, with respect to four of the six voting members of the Commission, neither the President, the head of any department, nor the Judiciary has any voice in their selection. The Appointments Clause specifies the method of appointment only for ""Officers of the United States"" whose appointment is not ""otherwise provided for"" in the Constitution.  But there is no provision of the Constitution remotely providing any alternative means for the selection of the members of the Commission or for anybody like them.  Appellee Commission has argued, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that the Appointments Clause of Art. II should not be read to exclude the ""inherent power of Congress"" to appoint its own officers to perform functions necessary to that body as an institution.  But there is no need to read the Appointments Clause contrary to its plain language in order to reach the result sought by the Court of Appeals.  Article I, § 3, cl. 5, expressly authorizes the selection of the President  pro tempore  of the Senate, and § 2, cl. 5, of that Article provides   for the selection of the Speaker of the House. Ranking nonmembers, such as the Clerk of the House of Representatives, are elected under the internal rules of each House, [ Footnote 163 ] and are designated by statute as ""officers of the Congress."" [ Footnote 164 ]  There is no occasion for us to decide whether any of these member officers are ""Officers of the United States"" whose ""appointment"" is otherwise provided for within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, since, even if they were such officers, their appointees would not be.  Contrary to the fears expressed by the majority of the Court of Appeals, nothing in our holding with respect to Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, will deny to Congress ""all power to appoint its own inferior officers to carry out appropriate legislative functions."" [ Footnote 165 ] Appellee Commission and  amici  contend somewhat obliquely that, because the Framers had no intention of relegating Congress to a position below that of the coequal Judicial and Executive Branches of the National Government, the Appointments Clause must somehow be read to include Congress or its officers as among those   in whom the appointment power may be vested.  But the debates of the Constitutional Convention, and the Federalist Papers, are replete with expressions of fear that the Legislative Branch of the National Government will aggrandize itself at the expense of the other two branches. [ Footnote 166 ]  The debates during the Convention, and the evolution of the draft version of the Constitution, seem to us to lend considerable support to our reading of the language of the Appointments Clause itself. An interim version of the draft Constitution had vested in the Senate the authority to appoint Ambassadors, public Ministers, and Judges of the Supreme Court, and the language of Art. II as finally adopted is a distinct change in this regard.  We believe that it was a deliberate change made by the Framers with the intent to deny Congress any authority itself to appoint those who were ""Officers of the United States.""  The debates on the floor of the Convention reflect at least in part the way the change came about. On Monday, August 6, 1787, the Committee on Detail to which had been referred the entire draft of the Constitution reported its draft to the Convention, including the following two articles that bear on the question before us: [ Footnote 167 ] ""Article IX, § 1:  'The Senate of the United States shall have power . . . to appoint Ambassadors, and Judges of the Supreme Court.'"" ""Article X, § 2:  '[The President] shall commission all   the officers of the United States, and shall appoint officers in all cases not otherwise provided for by this Constitution.'"" It will be seen from a comparison of these two articles that the appointment of Ambassadors and Judges of the Supreme Court was confided to the Senate, and that the authority to  appoint  -- not merely nominate, but to actually appoint -- all other officers was reposed in the President. During a discussion of a provision in the same draft from the Committee on Detail which provided that the ""Treasurer"" of the United States should be chosen by both Houses of Congress, Mr Read moved to strike out that clause, ""leaving the appointment of the Treasurer  as of other officers  to the Executive."" [ Footnote 168 ]  Opposition to Read's motion was based not on objection to the principle of executive appointment, but on the particular nature of the office of the ""Treasurer."" [ Footnote 169 ] On Thursday, August 23, the Convention voted to insert after the word ""Ambassadors"" in the text of draft Art. IX the words ""and other public Ministers.""  Immediately afterwards, the section as amended was referred to the ""Committee of Five."" [ Footnote 170 ]  The following day, the Convention took up Art. X.  Roger Sherman objected to the draft language of § 2 because it conferred too much power on the President, and proposed to insert after the words ""not otherwise provided for by this Constitution"" the words ""or by law.""  This motion was defeated by a vote of nine States to one. [ Footnote 171 ]  On September   3, the Convention debated the Ineligibility and Incompatibility Clauses which now appear in Art. I, and made the Ineligibility Clause somewhat less stringent. [ Footnote 172 ] Meanwhile, on Friday, August 31, a motion had been carried without opposition to refer such parts of the Constitution as had been postponed or not acted upon to a Committee of Eleven.  Such reference carried with it both Arts. IX and X.  The following week, the Committee of Eleven made its report to the Convention, in which the present language of Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, dealing with the authority of the President to nominate is found, virtually word for word, as § 4 of Art. X. [ Footnote 173 ]  The same Committee also reported a revised article concerning the Legislative Branch to the Convention.  The changes are obvious.  In the final version, the Senate is shorn of its power to appoint Ambassadors and Judges of the Supreme Court.  The President is given not the power to appoint public officers of the United States, but only the right to nominate them, and a provision is inserted by virtue of which Congress may require Senate confirmation of his nominees. It would seem a fair surmise that a compromise had been made.  But no change was made in the concept of the term ""Officers of the United States,"" which, since it had first appeared in Art. X, had been taken by all concerned to embrace all appointed officials exercising responsibility under the public laws of the Nation. Appellee Commission and  amici  urge that, because of what they conceive to be the extraordinary authority reposed in Congress to regulate elections, this case stands on a different footing than if Congress had exercised its legislative authority in another field.  There is, of course, no doubt that Congress has express authority to regulate   congressional elections, by virtue of the power conferred in Art. I, § 4. [ Footnote 174 ]  This Court has also held that it has very broad authority to prevent corruption in national Presidential elections.   Burroughs v. United States,   290 U. S. 534  (1934).  But Congress has plenary authority in all areas in which it has substantive legislative jurisdiction,  M'Culloch v. Maryland ,  4 Wheat. 316 (1819), so long as the exercise of that authority does not offend some other constitutional restriction.  We see no reason to believe that the authority of Congress over federal election practices is of such a wholly different nature from the other grants of authority to Congress that it may be employed in such a manner as to offend well established constitutional restrictions stemming from the separation of powers. The position that, because Congress has been given explicit and plenary authority to regulate a field of activity, it must therefore have the power to appoint those who are to administer the regulatory statute is both novel and contrary to the language of the Appointments Clause.  Unless their selection is elsewhere provided for, all officers of the United States are to be appointed in accordance with the Clause.  Principal officers are selected by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  Inferior officers Congress may allow to be appointed by the President alone, by the heads of departments, or by the Judiciary.  No class or type of officer is excluded because of its special functions.  The President appoints judicial, as well as executive, officers.  Neither has it been disputed -- and apparently   it is not now disputed -- that the Clause controls the appointment of the members of a typical administrative agency even though its functions, as this Court recognized in  Humphrey's Executor v. United States,   295 U. S. 602 ,   295 U. S. 624  (1935), may be ""predominantly  quasi -judicial and  quasi -legislative,"" rather than executive.  The Court in that case carefully emphasized that, although the members of such agencies were to be independent of the Executive in their day-to-day operations, the Executive was not excluded from selecting them.   Id.  at   295 U. S. 625 -626. Appellees argue that the legislative authority conferred upon the Congress in Art. I, § 4, to regulate ""the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives"" is augmented by the provision in § 5 that ""Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members.""  Section 5 confers, however, not a general legislative power upon the Congress, but rather a power ""judicial in character"" upon each House of the Congress.   Barry v. United States ex rel. Cunningham,   279 U. S. 597 ,   279 U. S. 613  (1929).  The power of each House to judge whether one claiming election as Senator or Representative has met the requisite qualifications,  Powell v. McCormack,   395 U. S. 486  (1969), cannot reasonably be translated into a power granted to the Congress itself to impose substantive qualifications on the right to so hold such office.  Whatever power Congress may have to legislate, such qualifications must derive from § 4, rather than § 5, of Art. I. Appellees also rely on the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution insofar as the authority of the Commission to regulate practices in connection with the Presidential election is concerned.  This Amendment provides that certificates of the votes of the electors be ""sealed [and]   directed to the President of the Senate,"" and that the ""President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted.""  The method by which Congress resolved the celebrated disputed Hayes-Tilden election of 1876, reflected in 19 Stat. 227, supports the conclusion that Congress viewed this Amendment as conferring upon its two Houses the same sort of power ""judicial in character,""  Barr v. United States ex rel. Cunningham, supra  at   279 U. S. 613 , as was conferred upon each House by Art. I, § 5, with respect to elections of its own members. We are also told by appellees and  amici  that Congress had good reason for not vesting in a Commission composed wholly of Presidential appointees the authority to administer the Act, since the administration of the Act would undoubtedly have a bearing on any incumbent President's campaign for reelection.  While one cannot dispute the basis for this sentiment as a practical matter, it would seem that those who sought to challenge incumbent Congressmen might have equally good reason to fear a Commission which was unduly responsive to members of Congress whom they were seeking to unseat.  But such fears, however rational, do not, by themselves, warrant a distortion of the Framers' work. Appellee Commission and  amici  finally contend, and the majority of the Court of Appeals agreed with them, that, whatever shortcomings the provisions for the appointment of members of the Commission might have under Art. II, Congress had ample authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I to effectuate this result.  We do not agree.  The proper inquiry when considering the Necessary and Proper Clause is not the authority of Congress to create an office or a commission, which is broad indeed, but rather its authority to provide   that its own officers may make appointments to such office or commission. So framed, the claim that Congress may provide for this manner of appointment under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I stands on no better footing than the claim that it may provide for such manner of appointment because of its substantive authority to regulate federal elections.  Congress could not, merely because it concluded that such a measure was ""necessary and proper"" to the discharge of its substantive legislative authority, pass a bill of attainder or  ex post facto  law contrary to the prohibitions contained in § 9 of Art. I.  No more may it vest in itself, or in its officers, the authority to appoint officers of the United States when the Appointments Clause, by clear implication, prohibits it from doing so. The trilogy of cases from this Court dealing with the constitutional authority of Congress to circumscribe the President's power to  remove  officers of the United States is entirely consistent with this conclusion.  In  Myers v. United States,   272 U. S. 52  (1926), the Court held that Congress could not, by statute, divest the President of the power to remove an officer in the Executive Branch whom he was initially authorized to appoint.  In explaining its reasoning in that case, the Court said: ""The vesting of the executive power in the President was essentially a grant of the power to execute the laws.  But the President, alone and unaided, could not execute the laws.  He must execute them by the assistance of subordinates. . . .  As he is charged specifically to take care that they be faithfully executed, the reasonable implication, even in the absence of express words, was that, as part of his executive power, he should select those who were   to act for him under his direction in the execution of the laws."" "" *    *    *    *""  ""Our conclusion on the merits, sustained by the arguments before stated, is that Article II grants to the President the executive power of the Government,  i.e.,  the general administrative control of those executing the laws, including the power of appointment and removal of executive officers -- a conclusion confirmed by his obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. . . ."" Id.  at   272 U. S. 117 ,   272 U. S. 163 -164. In the later case of  Humphrey's Executor,  where it was held that Congress could circumscribe the President's power to remove members of independent regulatory agencies, the Court was careful to note that it was dealing with an agency intended to be independent of executive authority "" except in its selection. ""  295 U.S. at   295 U. S. 625  (emphasis in original).   Wiener v. United States,   357 U. S. 349  (1958), which applied the holding in  Humphrey's Executor  to a member of the War Claims Commission, did not question in any respect that members of independent agencies are not independent of the Executive with respect to their appointments. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Mr. Justice Sutherland, the author of the Court's opinion in  Humphrey's Executor,  likewise wrote the opinion for the Court in  Springer v. Philippine Islands,   277 U. S. 189  (1928), in which it was said: ""Not having the power of appointment, unless expressly granted or incidental to its powers, the legislature cannot engraft executive duties upon a legislative office, since that would be to usurp the power of appointment by indirection; though the case might be different if the additional duties   were devolved upon an appointee of the executive."" Id.  at   277 U. S. 202 . 3. The Commission's Powers Thus, on the assumption that all of the powers granted in the statute may be exercised by an agency whose members  have been  appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause, [ Footnote 175 ] the ultimate question is which, if any, of those powers may be exercised by the present voting Commissioners, none of whom was appointed as provided by that Clause.  Our previous description of the statutory provisions,  see supra  at   424 U.S. 1 09 -113, disclosed that the Commission's powers fall generally into three categories:  functions relating to the flow of necessary information -- receipt, dissemination, and investigation; functions with respect to the Commission's task of fleshing out the statute -- rulemaking and advisory opinions; and functions necessary to ensure compliance with the statute and rules -- informal procedures, administrative determinations and hearings, and civil suits. Insofar as the powers confided in the Commission are essentially of an investigative and informative nature, falling in the same general category as those powers which Congress might delegate to one of its own committees, there can be no question that the Commission as presently constituted may exercise them.   Kilbourn v. Thompson,   103 U. S. 168  (1881);  McGrain v. Daugherty ,     273 U. S. 135  (1927);  Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund,   421 U. S. 491  (1975).  As this Court stated in  McGrain, supra,  at   273 U. S. 175 : ""A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information -- which not infrequently is true -- recourse must be had to others who do possess it.  Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed.  All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted.  In that period, the power of inquiry -- with enforcing process -- was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate -- indeed, was treated as inhering in it."" But when we go beyond this type of authority to the more substantial powers exercised by the Commission, we reach a different result.  The Commission's enforcement power, exemplified by its discretionary power to seek judicial relief, is authority that cannot possibly be regarded as merely in aid of the legislative function of Congress.  A lawsuit is the ultimate remedy for a breach of the law, and it is to the President, and not to the Congress, that the Constitution entrusts the responsibility to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.""  Art. II, § 3 Congress may undoubtedly under the Necessary and Proper Clause create ""offices"" in the generic sense and provide such method of appointment to those ""offices"" as it chooses.  But Congress' power under that Clause   is inevitably bounded by the express language of Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, and, unless the method it provides comports with the latter, the holders of those offices will not be ""Officers of the United States.""  They may, therefore, properly perform duties only in aid of those functions that Congress may carry out by itself, or in an area sufficiently removed from the administration and enforcement of the public law as to permit their being performed by persons not ""Officers of the United States."" This Court observed more than a century ago with respect to litigation conducted in the courts of the United States: ""Whether tested, therefore, by the requirements of the Judiciary Act, or by the usage of the government, or by the decisions of this court, it is clear that all such suits, so far as the interests of the United States are concerned, are subject to the direction, and within the control of, the Attorney General."" Confiscation Cases ,  7 Wall. 454,   74 U. S. 458 -459 (1869). The Court echoed similar sentiments 59 years later in  Springer v. Philippine Islands,  277 U.S. at   277 U. S. 202 , saying: ""Legislative power, as distinguished from executive power, is the authority to make laws, but not to enforce them or appoint the agents charged with the duty of such enforcement.  The latter are executive functions.  It is unnecessary to enlarge further upon the general subject, since it has so recently received the full consideration of this Court.   Myers v. United States,   272 U. S. 52 ."" ""Not having the power of appointment unless expressly granted or incidental to its powers, the legislature cannot engraft executive duties upon a legislative office, since that would be to usurp the power of appointment by indirection, though the   case might be different if the additional duties were devolved upon an appointee of the executive."" We hold that these provisions of the Act, vesting in the Commission primary responsibility for conducting civil litigation in the courts of the United States for vindicating public rights, violate Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution.  Such functions may be discharged only by persons who are ""Officers of the United States"" within the language of that section. All aspects of the Act are brought within the Commission's broad administrative powers:  rulemaking, advisory opinions, and determinations of eligibility for funds and even for federal elective office itself.  These functions, exercised free from day-to-day supervision of either Congress [ Footnote 176 ] or the Executive Branch, are more legislative and judicial in nature than are the Commission's   enforcement powers, and are of kinds usually performed by independent regulatory agencies or by some department in the Executive Branch under the direction of an Act of Congress.  Congress viewed these broad powers as essential to effective and impartial administration of the entire substantive framework of the Act.  Yet each of these functions also represents the performance of a significant governmental duty exercised pursuant to a public law.  While the President may not insist that such functions be delegated to an appointee of his removable at will,  Humphrey's Executor v. United States,   295 U. S. 602  (1935), none of them operates merely in aid of congressional authority to legislate or is sufficiently removed from the administration and enforcement of public law to allow it to be performed by the present Commission.  These administrative functions may therefore be exercised only by persons who are ""Officers of the United States."" [ Footnote 177 ]  It is also our view that the Commission's inability to exercise certain powers because of the method by which its members have been selected should not affect the validity of the Commission's administrative actions and determinations to this date, including its administration of those provisions, upheld today, authorizing the public financing of federal elections.  The past acts of the Commission are therefore accorded  de facto  validity, just as we have recognized should be the case with respect to legislative acts performed by legislators held to have been elected in accordance with an unconstitutional apportionment plan.   Connor v. Williams,   404 U. S. 549 ,   404 U. S. 559 -551 (1972).   See Ryan v. Tinsley,  316 F.2d 430, 431-432 (CA10 1963);  Schaefer v. Thomson,   251 F. Supp. 450 , 453 (Wyo.1965),  aff'd sub nom. Harrison v. Schaeffer,   383 U. S. 269  (1966).   Cf. City of Richmond v. United States,   422 U. S. 358 ,   422 U. S. 379  (1975) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  We also draw on the Court's practice in   the apportionment and voting rights cases and stay, for a period not to exceed 30 days, the Court's judgment insofar as it affects the authority of the Commission to exercise the duties and powers granted it under the Act.  This limited stay will afford Congress an opportunity to reconstitute the Commission by law or to adopt other valid enforcement mechanisms without interrupting enforcement of the provisions the Court sustains, allowing the present Commission in the interim to function  de facto  in accordance with the substantive provisions of the Act.   Cf. Georgia v. United States,   411 U. S. 526 ,   411 U. S. 541  (1973);  Fortson v. Morris,   385 U. S. 231 ,   385 U. S. 235  (1966);  Maryland Comm. v. Tawes,   377 U. S. 656 ,   377 U. S. 675 -676 (1964). CONCLUSION
 In summary, [ Footnote 178 ] we sustain the individual contribution limits, the disclosure and reporting provisions, and the public financing scheme.  We conclude, however, that the limitations on campaign expenditures, on independent expenditures by individuals and groups, and on expenditures by a candidate from his personal funds are constitutionally infirm.  Finally, we hold that most of the powers conferred by the Act upon the Federal Election Commission can be exercised only by ""Officers of the United States,"" appointed in conformity with Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, and therefore cannot be exercised by the Commission as presently constituted. In No. 75-436, the judgment of the Court of Appeals   is affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The judgment of the District Court in No. 75-437 is affirmed.  The mandate shall issue forthwith, except that our judgment is stayed, for a period not to exceed 30 days, insofar as it affects the authority of the Commission to exercise the duties and powers granted it under the Act. So ordered."

 Syllabus   After respondent had sought separate maintenance, her husband, the scion of a wealthy industrial family, filed a counterclaim for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.  The court granted the counterclaim, stating that ""neither party is domesticated, within the meaning of that term as used by the Supreme Court of Florida,"" and that ""the marriage should be dissolved.""  On the basis of newspaper and wire service reports and information from a bureau chief and a ""stringer,"" petitioner published in its magazine an item reporting that the divorce was granted ""on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.""  After petitioner had declined to retract, respondent brought this libel action in the state court.  A jury verdict for damages against petitioner was ultimately affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court.  Petitioner claims that the judgment violates its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Held: 1. The standard enunciated in  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , as later extended, which bars media liability for defamation of a public figure absent proof that the defamatory statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, is inapplicable to the facts of this case.  Pp.   424 U. S. 452 -457. (a) Respondent was not a ""public figure,"" since she did not occupy ""[a role] of especial prominence in the affairs of society,"" and had not been ""thrust . . . to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.""   Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,   418 U. S. 323 ,   418 U. S. 345 .  Pp.   424 U. S. 453 -455. (b) The  New York Times  rule does not automatically extend to all reports of judicial proceedings regardless of whether the party plaintiff in such proceedings is a public figure who might be assumed to ""have voluntarily exposed [himself] to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood.""   Gertz, supra  at   418 U. S. 345 .  There is no substantial reason why one involved in litigation should forfeit that degree of protection afforded by the law of defamation imply by virtue of being drawn into a courtroom.  Pp.   424 U. S. 455 -457.  2. No finding was ever made by the divorce court that respondent was guilty of adultery as petitioner had reported, and though petitioner contends that it faithfully reproduced the precise meaning of the divorce judgment, the jury's verdict, upheld on appeal, rejected petitioner's contention that the report was accurate.  Pp.   424 U. S. 457 -459. 3. In a case such as this,  Gertz, supra,  imposes the constitutional limitations that (1) compensatory awards ""be supported by competent evidence concerning the injury"" and (2) liability cannot be imposed without fault.  Since Florida permits damages awards in defamation actions based on elements other than injury to reputation, and there was competent evidence here to permit the jury to assess the amount of such injury, the first of these conditions was satisfied.  Pp.   424 U. S. 459 -461. 4. Since, however, there was no finding of fault on the part of the petitioner in its publication of the defamatory material, the second constitutional limitation imposed by  Gertz  was not met.  Though the trial court's failure to submit the question of fault to the jury does not, of itself, establish noncompliance with the constitutional requirement, none of the Florida courts that considered this case determined that petitioner was at fault.

 FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   When striking members of respondent union picketed in front of their employer's leased store located in petitioner's shopping center, the shopping center's general manager threatened them with arrest for criminal trespass if they did not depart, and they left.  The union then filed unfair labor practice charges against petitioner, alleging that the threat constituted interference with rights protected by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), concluding that the NLRA had been violated, issued a cease and desist order against petitioner, and the Court of Appeals enforced the order.  Petitioner and respondent union contend that the respective rights and liabilities of the parties are to be decided under the criteria of the NLRA alone, whereas the NLRB contends that such rights and liabilities must be measured under a First Amendment standard. Held: 1. Under the present state of the law, the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this, and the pickets here did not have a First Amendment right to enter the shopping center for the purpose of advertising their strike against their employer.   Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner,   407 U. S. 551 .  Pp.   424 U. S. 512 -521. 2. The rights and liabilities of the parties are dependent exclusively upon the NLRA, under which it is the NLRB's task, subject to judicial review, to resolve conflicts between § 7 rights and private property rights and to seek accommodation of such rights ""with as little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other,""  NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.,   351 U. S. 105 ,   351 U. S. 112 .  Hence, the case is remanded so that the NLRB may reconsider the case under the NLRA's statutory criteria alone.  Pp.   424 U.

 Syllabus   Pursuant to an Alabama statutory procedure, a prosecuting attorney brought an  in rem  equity action in state court against four magazines named as ""respondents,"" and two other parties, seeking an adjudication of the magazines' obscenity, which resulted in the court's decree that the magazines were ""judicially declared to be obscene.""  Petitioner, a bookstall operator who had not been given notice of or made a party to the equity proceeding, was officially advised of the decree concerning the specific magazines.  After officers later bought one of the magazines (New Directions) from petitioner's bookstall, he was charged with violating a criminal statute by selling ""mailable matter known . . . to have been judicially found to be obscene.""  At petitioner's trial, which resulted in his conviction, later upheld on appeal, petitioner was not allowed to have the issue of New Direction's obscenity presented to the jurors, who were instructed that they were not to be concerned with determining obscenity, but only with whether or not petitioner had sold material judicially declared to be obscene. Held:   The Alabama procedures, insofar as they precluded petitioner from litigating the obscenity  vel non  of New Directions as a defense to his criminal prosecution, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.   Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51 ;  Heller v. New York,   413 U. S. 483 .  The constitutional infirmity of those procedures cannot be avoided on the ground urged by the State that the equity action constituted an ""adversary judicial proceeding,"" since the respondents in that action were not in privity with the petitioner, and cannot be presumed to have had interests sufficiently identical to petitioner's as adequately to protect his First Amendment rights, which he had a right to assert in his own behalf in a proceeding to which he was a party.

 FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Fort Dix, a federal military reservation devoted primarily to basic training for newly inducted Army personnel, and over which the Government exercises exclusive jurisdiction, permits free civilian access to certain unrestricted areas.  However, post regulations ban speeches and demonstrations of a partisan political nature and also prohibit the distribution of literature without prior approval of post headquarters.  Pursuant to these regulations, the commanding officer of Fort Dix rejected the request of respondent candidates for President and Vice President to distribute campaign literature and hold a political meeting on the post and the other respondents, who had been evicted on several occasions for distributing literature not previously approved, were barred from reentering the post.  Respondents brought suit to enjoin enforcement of these regulations on the ground that they violated the First and Fifth Amendments.  The District Court issued an injunction prohibiting the military authorities from interfering with the making of political speeches or the distribution of leaflets in areas of Fort Dix open to the general public, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. The regulations are not constitutionally invalid on their face.  Since under the Constitution it is the basic function of a military installation like Fort Dix to train soldiers, not to provide a public forum, and since, as a necessary concomitant to this basic function, a commanding officer has the historically unquestioned power to exclude civilians from the area of his command, any notion that federal military installations, like municipal streets and parks, have traditionally served as a place for free public assembly and communication of thoughts by private citizens is false, and therefore respondents had no generalized constitutional right to make political speeches or distribute leaflets at Fort Dix.   Flower v. United States,   407 U. S. 197 , distinguished.  Pp.   424 U. S. 834 -838. 2. Nor were the regulations unconstitutionally applied under the circumstances of this case.  Pp.   424 U. S. 838 -840.  (a) As to the regulation banning political speeches and demonstrations, there is no claim that the military authorities discriminated in any way among candidates based upon the candidates' supposed political views; on the contrary, it appears that Fort Dix has a policy, objectively and evenhandedly applied, of keeping official military activities there wholly free of entanglement with any partisan political campaigns, a policy that the post was constitutionally free to pursue.  Pp.   424 U. S. 838 -839. (b) As to the regulation governing the distribution of literature, a military commander may disapprove only those publications that he perceives clearly endanger the loyalty, discipline, or morale of troops on the base under his command, and, while this regulation might in the future be applied irrationally, invidiously, or arbitrarily, none of the respondents even submitted any material for review, and the noncandidate respondents had been excluded from the post because they had previously distributed literature there without attempting to obtain approval.

 FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A county regulation limiting the length of county policemen's hair held not to violate any right guaranteed respondent policeman by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   425 U. S. 244 -249. (a) Respondent sought the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment, not as an ordinary citizen, but as a law enforcement employee of the county, a subdivision of the State, and this distinction is one of considerable significance, since a State has wider latitude and notably different interests in imposing restrictive regulations on its employees than it does in regulating the citizenry at large.  P.   425 U. S. 245 . (b) Choice of organization, dress, and equipment for law enforcement personnel is entitled to the same sort of presumption of legislative validity as are state choices to promote other aims within the cognizance of the State's police power.  Thus, the question is not whether the State can ""establish"" a ""genuine public need"" for the specific regulation, but whether respondent can demonstrate that there is no rational connection between the regulation, based as it is on the county's method of organizing its police force, and the promotion of safety of persons and property.  P.   425 U. S. 245 -247. (c) Whether a state or local government's choice to have its police uniformed reflects a desire to make police officers readily recognizable to the public or to foster the  esprit de corps  that similarity of garb and appearance may inculcate within the police force itself, the justification for the hair style regulation is sufficiently rational to defeat respondent's claim based on the liberty guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Mayor of Oradell No. 74-1329 Argued December 10, 1975 Decided May 19, 1976 425 U.S. 610 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY
 Syllabus   A municipal ordinance requiring that advance written notice be given to the local police department by ""[a]ny person [including representatives of Borough Civic Groups and Organizations] desiring to canvass, solicit or call from house to house . . . for a recognized charitable cause, or . . . for a Federal, State, County or Municipal political campaign or cause . . . for identification only"" held  invalid because of vagueness.  A municipality has the power to enforce reasonable door-to-door soliciting and canvassing regulations to protect its citizens from crime and undue annoyance.  The Court has consistently recognized that a narrowly drawn ordinance that does not vest in municipal officials the undefined power to determine what residents will hear or see may serve these interests consistent with the First Amendment.  The ordinance in question must fall, however, because, in certain respects, ""men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.""   Connally v. General Constr. Co.,   269 U. S. 385 ,   269 U. S. 391 .  First, the ordinance's coverage is unclear, since it does not explain whether a ""recognized charitable cause"" means one recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as tax exempt, one recognized by some community agency, or one approved by some municipal official; nor is it clear what is meant by a ""Federal, State, County or Municipal . . . cause,"" or what groups fall into the class of ""Borough Civic Groups and Organizations"" that the ordinance covers.

 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
 Syllabus   Appellees, as consumers of prescription drugs, brought suit against the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy and its individual members, appellants herein, challenging the validity under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of a Virginia statute declaring it unprofessional conduct for a licensed pharmacist to advertise the prices of prescription drugs.  A three-judge District Court declared the statute void and enjoined appellants from enforcing it. Held: 1. Any First Amendment protection enjoyed by advertisers seeking to disseminate prescription drug price information is also enjoyed, and thus may be asserted, by appellees as recipients of such information.  Pp.   425 U. S. 756 -757. 2. ""Commercial speech"" is not wholly outside the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Virginia statute is therefore invalid.  Pp.   425 U. S. 761 -773. (a) That the advertiser's interest in a commercial advertisement is purely economic does not disqualify him from protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Both the individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow of commercial information.  Pp.   425 U. S. 762 -765. (b) The ban on advertising prescription drug prices cannot be justified on the basis of the State's interest in maintaining the professionalism of its licensed pharmacists; the State is free to require whatever professional standards it wishes of its pharmacists, and may subsidize them or protect them from competition in other ways, but it may not do so by keeping the public in ignorance of the lawful terms that competing pharmacists are offering.  Pp.   425 U. S. 766 -770. (c) Whatever may be the bounds of time, place, and manner restrictions on commercial speech, they are plainly exceeded by   the Virginia statute, which singles out speech of a particular content and seeks to prevent its dissemination completely.  Pp.   425 U. S. 770 -771. (d) No claim is made that the prohibited prescription drug advertisements are false, misleading, or propose illegal transactions, and a State may not suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that information's effect upon its disseminators and its recipients.  Pp.   425 U. S. 771 -773. 373 F. Supp. 683 , affirmed. BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN, STEWART, WHITE, MARSHALL, and POWELL, JJ., joined.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND
 Syllabus   In 1971, a Maryland statute was enacted that authorizes the payment of state funds to any private institution of higher learning within the State that meets certain minimum criteria, and refrains from awarding ""only seminarian or theological degrees.""  The aid is in the form of an annual fiscal year subsidy to qualifying colleges and universities, based upon the number of students, excluding those in seminarian or theological academic programs.  The grants are noncategorical, but may not, under a provision added in 1972, ""be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes.""  The assistance program is primarily administered by the Maryland Council for Higher Education, which, in order to insure compliance with statutory restrictions, (1) determines whether an applicant institution is eligible at all, or is one ""awarding primarily theological or seminary degrees,"" and (2) requires that eligible institutions not use funds for sectarian purposes.  At the end of the fiscal year, the recipient institution must make a report and separately identify the aided nonsectarian expenditures, subject to the Council's verification if necessary.  This suit was brought by appellants, four individual Maryland citizens and taxpayers, who challenged the statutory scheme as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and claimed that appellees, four colleges affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, were constitutionally ineligible for the state aid.  The District Court, applying the three-part requirement of  Lemon v. Kurtzman,   403 U. S. 602  ( viz.,  state aid such as this must have a secular purpose, a primary effect other than the advancement of religion, and no tendency to entangle the State excessively in church affairs), upheld the statute and denied appellants relief.  The court found that, despite their formal affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church, appellee colleges are not ""pervasively sectarian.""  The court also found that aid was, in fact, extended only to ""the secular side,"" having taken cognizance of the statutory prohibition against sectarian use, and the Council's administrative   enforcement of that prohibition.  The court also found that ""there is no necessity for state officials to investigate the conduct of particular classes of educational programs to determine whether a school is attempting to indoctrinate its students under the guise of secular education,"" and that ""excessive entanglement"" does not necessarily result from the fact that the subsidy is on an annual basis.  Though occasional audits are possible to verify the sectarian purposes of expenditures, the District Court found that they would be ""quick and nonjudgmental."" Held:   The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.   426 U. S. 745 -767;   426 U. S. 767 -770. 387 F. Supp. 1282 , affirmed."

 FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent operators of two adult motion picture theaters brought this action against petitioner city officials for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment of unconstitutionality regarding two 1972 Detroit zoning ordinances that amended an ""Anti-Skid Row Ordinance"" adopted 10 years earlier.  The 1972 ordinances provide that an adult theater may not (apart from a special waiver) be located within 1,000 feet of any two other ""regulated uses"" or within 500 feet of a residential area.  The term ""regulated uses"" applies to 10 different kinds of establishments in addition to adult theaters, including adult book stores, cabarets, bars, taxi dance halls, and hotels.  If the theater is used to present ""material distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting . . . 'specified Sexual Activities' or 'specified Anatomical Areas,'"" it is an ""adult"" establishment.  The District Court upheld the ordinances, and granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the ordinances constituted a prior restraint on constitutionally protected communication and violated equal protection.  Respondents, in addition to asserting the correctness of that court's ruling with respect to those constitutional issues, contend that the ordinances are void for vagueness.  While not attacking the specificity of the definitions of sexual activities or anatomical areas, respondents maintain (1) that they cannot determine how much of the described activity may be permissible before an exhibition is ""characterized by an emphasis"" on such matter, and (2) that the ordinances do not specify adequate procedures or standards for obtaining a waiver of the 1,000-foot restriction. Held: 1. The ordinances, as applied to these respondents, do not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on the ground of vagueness.  Pp.   427 U. S. 58 -61. (a) Neither of the asserted elements of vagueness has affected these respondents, both of which propose to offer adult fare on a regular basis and allege no ground for claiming or anticipating any waiver of the 1,000-foot restriction.  Pp.   427 U. S. 58 -59.  (b) The ordinances will have no demonstrably significant effect on the exhibition of films protected by the First Amendment.  To the extent that any area of doubt exists as to the amount of sexually explicit activity that may be portrayed before material can be said to be ""characterized by an emphasis"" on such matter, there is no reason why the ordinances are not ""readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts.""  This would therefore be an inappropriate case to apply the principle urged by respondents that they be permitted to challenge the ordinances not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of the assumption that the ordinances' very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.  Pp.   427 U. S. 59 -61. 2. The ordinances are not invalid under the First Amendment as prior restraints on protected communication because of the licensing or zoning requirements.  Though adult films may be exhibited commercially only in licensed theaters, that is also true of all films.  That the place where films may be exhibited is regulated does not violate free expression, the city's interest in planning and regulating the use of property for commercial purposes being clearly adequate to support the locational restriction.

 Syllabus   Respondents, Republicans who are non-civil service employees of the Cook County, Ill., Sheriff's Office, brought this suit as a class action for declaratory, injunctive, and other relief against petitioners, including the newly elected Sheriff, a Democrat, and county Democratic organizations, alleging that, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and various statutes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1871, respondents were discharged or (in the case of one respondent) threatened with discharge for the sole reason that they were not affiliated with or sponsored by the Democratic Party. Finding that respondents had failed to show irreparable injury, the District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and ultimately dismissed their complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with instructions to enter appropriate preliminary injunctive relief. Held:   The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.   427 U.

 Syllabus   Respondent Nebraska state trial judge, in anticipation of a trial for a multiple murder which had attracted widespread news coverage, entered an order which, as modified by the Nebraska Supreme Court, restrained petitioner newspapers, broadcasters, journalists, news media associations, and national newswire services from publishing or broadcasting accounts of confessions or admissions made by the accused to law enforcement officers or third parties, except members of the press, and other facts ""strongly implicative"" of the accused.  The modification of the order had occurred in the course of an action by petitioners, which had sought a stay of the trial court's original order and in which the accused and the State of Nebraska intervened.  This Court granted certiorari to determine whether the order violated the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press.  The order expired by its own terms when the jury was impaneled.  Respondent was convicted; his appeal is pending in the Nebraska Supreme Court. Held: 1. The case is not moot simply because the order has expired, since the controversy between the parties is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review.""  Pp.   427 U. S. 546 -547. 2. While the guarantees of freedom of expression are not an absolute prohibition under all circumstances, the barriers to prior restraint remain high and the presumption against its use continues intact.  Although it is unnecessary to establish a priority between First Amendment rights and the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial under all circumstances, as the authors of the Bill of Rights themselves declined to do, the protection against prior restraint should have particular force as applied to reporting of criminal proceedings.  Pp.   427 U. S. 556 -562. 3. The heavy burden imposed as a condition to securing a prior restraint was not met in this case.  Pp.   427 U. S. 562 -570. (a) On the pretrial record, the trial judge was justified in concluding that there would be intense and pervasive pretrial publicity concerning the case, and he could also reasonably   conclude, based on common human experience, that publicity might impair the accused's right to a fair trial.  His conclusion as to the impact of such publicity on prospective jurors was of necessity speculative, however, dealing as he was with factors unknown and unknowable.  Pp.   427 U. S. 562 -563. (b) There is no finding that measures short of prior restraint on the press and speech would not have protected the accused's rights; the Nebraska Supreme Court no more than implied that alternative measures might not suffice, and the record lacks evidence that would support such a finding.  Pp.   427 U. S. 563 -565. (c) It is not clear that prior restraint on publication would have effectively protected the accused's rights, in view of such practical problems as the limited territorial jurisdiction of the trial court issuing the restraining order, the difficulties inherent in predicting what information will in fact undermine the jurors' impartiality, the problem of drafting an order that will effectively keep prejudicial information from prospective jurors, and the fact that in this case the events occurred in a small community where rumors would travel swiftly by word of mouth.  Pp.   427 U. S. 565 -567. (d) To the extent that the order prohibited the reporting of evidence adduced at the open preliminary hearing held to determine whether the accused should be bound over for trial, it violated the settled principle that ""there is nothing that proscribes the press from reporting events that transpire in the courtroom,""  Sheppard v. Maxwell,   384 U. S. 333 ,   384 U. S. 362 -363, and the portion of the order restraining publication of other facts ""strongly implicative"" of the accused is too vague and too broad to survive the scrutiny given to restraints on First Amendment rights.

Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission No. 75-946 Argued October 12, 1976 Decided December 8, 1976 429 U.S. 167 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF WISCONSIN
 Syllabus   During the course of a regularly scheduled, open meeting of appellant Board of Education, public discussion turned to currently pending labor negotiations between the board and the teachers' union.  One speaker was a nonunion teacher who, over union objection, addressed one topic of the pending negotiations, namely, the union's demand for a ""fair share"" clause, which would require all teachers (whether union members or not) to pay union dues.  He read a petition signed by the teachers in the district, calling for postponement of the issue until it could be given closer examination by an impartial committee.  Subsequently, after a collective bargaining agreement had been signed containing all the union's demands except the ""fair share"" clause, the union filed a complaint with the appellee Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC), claiming that the board had committed a prohibited labor practice in violation of Wisconsin law by permitting the nonunion teacher to speak at its public meeting because that constituted negotiations by the board with a member of the bargaining unit other than the exclusive collective bargaining representative.  The WERC found the board guilty of the prohibited labor practice and ordered that it immediately cease and desist from permitting any employees but union officials to appear and speak at board meetings on matters subject to collective bargaining.  The WERC was upheld on appeal, the Wisconsin Supreme Court concluding that the nonunion teacher's statement before the board constituted ""negotiation"" with the board, and holding that the abridgment of speech by the WERC was justified in order ""to avoid the dangers attendant upon relative chaos in labor-management relations."" Held: 1. The circumstances do not present such danger to labor-management relations as to justify curtailing speech in the manner ordered by the WERC.  Pp.   429 U. S. 173 -176. (a) Where it does not appear that the nonunion teacher sought to bargain or offered to enter into any bargain with the board or that he was authorized by any other teachers to enter into any agreement on their behalf, there is no basis for concluding that his terse statement during the public meeting constituted negotiation with the board.  Although his views were not consistent with those of the union, communicating   such views to the employer could not change the fact that the union alone was authorized to negotiate and enter into a contract with the board.  P.   429 U. S. 174 . (b) Moreover, since the board meeting was open to the public, the nonunion teacher addressed the board not merely as one of its employees but also as a concerned citizen, seeking to express his views on an important decision of his government.  Where the board has so opened a forum for direct citizen involvement, it may not exclude teachers who make up the overwhelming proportion of school employees and are most concerned with the proceedings.  Whatever its duties as an employer, when the board sits in public meetings to conduct public business and hear the views of citizens, under the First Amendment, it may not be required to discriminate between speakers on the basis of their employment, or the content of their speech.  Pp.   429 U. S. 174 -176. 2. The WERC's order, being designed to govern speech and conduct in the future, and not merely to punish past conduct, is an improper prior restraint on teachers' expressions to the board on matters involving the operation of schools.

 FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent, an untenured teacher (who had previously been involved in an altercation with another teacher, an argument with school cafeteria employees, an incident in which he swore at students, and an incident in which he made obscene gestures to girl students), conveyed through a telephone call to a radio station the substance of a memorandum relating to teacher dress and appearance that the school principal had circulated to various teachers.  The radio station announced the adoption of the dress code as a news item.  Thereafter, petitioner School Board, adopting a recommendation of the superintendent, advised respondent that he would not be rehired, and cited his lack of tact in handling professional matters, with specific mention of the radio station and obscene gesture incidents.  Respondent then brought this action against petitioner for reinstatement and damages, claiming that petitioner's refusal to rehire him violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Although respondent asserted jurisdiction under both 28 U.S.C. § 1343 and § 1331, the District Court rested jurisdiction only on § 1331.  The District Court, which found that the incidents involving respondent had occurred, concluded that the telephone call was ""clearly protected by the First Amendment"" and that, because it had played a ""substantial part"" in petitioner's decision not to rehire respondent, he was entitled to reinstatement with backpay.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner, in addition to attacking the District Court's jurisdiction under § 1331 on the ground that the $10,000 jurisdictional requirement of that provision was not satisfied in this case, raised an additional jurisdictional issue after this Court had granted certiorari and after petitioner had filed its reply brief, claiming that respondent's only substantive constitutional claim arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and that, because petitioner School Board is not a ""person"" for purposes of § 1983, liability may no more be imposed on it where federal jurisdiction rests on § 1331 than where jurisdiction is grounded on § 1343. Held: 1. Respondent's complaint sufficiently pleaded jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Though the amount in controversy thereunder must    exceed $10,000, even if the District Court had chosen to award only compensatory damages, it was far from a ""legal certainty"" at the time of suit that respondent would not have been entitled to more than that amount.   St. Paul Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,   303 U. S. 283 ,   303 U. S. 288 -289.  Pp.   429 U. S. 276 -277. 2. Petitioner, in making its belated contention concerning § 1983, failed to preserve the issue whether the complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted against it.  Because the question involved is not of the jurisdictional sort which the Court raises on its own motion, it is assumed without deciding that respondent could sue under § 1331 without regard to the limitations imposed by § 1983.  Pp.   429 U. S. 277 -279. 3. Since, under Ohio law, the ""State"" does not include ""political subdivisions"" (a category including school districts), and the record shows that a local school board like petitioner is more like a county or city than it is an arm of the State, petitioner is not immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.  Pp.   429 U. S. 279 -281. 4. Respondent's constitutional claims are not defeated because he did not have tenure.   Perry v. Sindermann,   408 U. S. 593 .  Pp.   429 U. S. 283 -284. 5. That conduct protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments played a substantial part in the decision not to rehire respondent does not necessarily amount to a constitutional violation justifying remedial action.  The proper test is one that protects against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights.  Since respondent here satisfied the burden of showing that his conduct was constitutionally protected and was a motivating factor in the petitioner's decision not to rehire him, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether petitioner had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the protected conduct.  Pp.   429 U. S. 284 --287. 529 F.2d 524, vacated and remanded. REHNQUIST, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. "

 FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioners were convicted of transporting obscene materials in violation of a federal statute.  The conduct that gave rise to the charge occurred before  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , was decided, announcing new standards for ""isolat[ing]  hard core' pornography from expression protected by the First Amendment,""  id.  at 29.
 Held:   The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to petitioners of the  Miller  standards, to the extent that those standards may impose criminal liability for conduct not punishable under the standards announced in  Memoirs v. Massachusetts,   383 U. S. 413 .   Bouie v. City of Columbia,   378 U. S. 347 .  Specifically, petitioners are entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless it finds that the materials involved are ""utterly without redeeming social value.""  At the same time, any constitutional principle announced in  Miller  that would serve to benefit petitioners must be applied in their case.   Hamling v. United States,   418 U. S. 87 ,   418 U.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
 Syllabus   New Hampshire statutes require that noncommercial motor vehicles bear license plates embossed with the state motto, ""Live Free or Die,"" and make it a misdemeanor to obscure the motto.  Appellees, Maynard and his wife, who are followers of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith, view the motto as repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs, and accordingly they covered up the motto on the license plates of their jointly owned family automobiles.  Appellee Maynard was subsequently found guilty in state court of violating the misdemeanor statute on three separate charges, and, upon refusing to pay the fines imposed, was sentenced to, and served, 15 days in jail.  Appellees then brought this action in Federal District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against enforcement of the New Hampshire statutes; a three-judge court enjoined the State from arresting and prosecuting appellees in the future for covering the motto on their license plates. Held: 1. The principles of equitable restraint enunciated in  Younger v. Harris,   401 U. S. 37 , do not preclude the District Court from exercising jurisdiction.  Pp.   430 U. S. 709 -712. (a) When a genuine threat of state prosecutions exists, a litigant is entitled to resort to a federal forum to seek redress for an alleged deprivation of federal rights, and, aside from  Younger  principles, may seek such redress under  42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Pp.   430 U. S. 709 -710. (b) When the relief sought is wholly prospective,  i.e.,  to preclude further prosecution under a statute alleged to violate constitutional rights, failure to seek state appellate review of criminal convictions does not bar relief in federal court.   Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.,   420 U. S. 592 , distinguished.  Pp.   430 U. S. 710 -711. (c) The threat of repeated prosecutions in the future against both appellees, and the effect of such a continuing threat on their ability to perform the ordinary tasks of daily life that require an automobile, are sufficient to justify injunctive relief, and hence the District Court was not limited to granting declaratory relief.  Pp.   430 U. S. 711 -712. 2. The State may not constitutionally require an individual to participate   in the dissemination of an ideological message by displaying it on his private property in a manner and for the express purpose that it be observed and read by the public. Pp. 71717. (a) New Hampshire's statute, by forcing an individual, as part of his daily life -- indeed, constantly while his automobile is in public view -- to be an instrument for advocating public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable, ""invades the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment . . . to reserve from all official control,""  Board of Education v. Barnette,   319 U. S. 624 ,   319 U. S. 642 .  Pp.   430 U. S. 714 -715. (b) The State's claimed interests in requiring display of the state motto on license plates (1) so as to facilitate the identification of passenger vehicles, and (2) so as to promote appreciation of history, individualism, and state pride, are not sufficiently compelling to justify infringement of appellees' First Amendment rights.  The purpose of the first interest could be achieved by less drastic means, and the second interest cannot outweigh an individual's First Amendment right to avoid becoming the courier for the State's ideological message.

 FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A township ordinance prohibiting the posting of real estate ""For Sale"" and ""Sold"" signs for the purpose of stemming what the township perceived as the flight of white homeowners from a racially integrated community  held  to violate the First Amendment.   Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,   425 U. S. 748 .  Pp.   431 U. S. 91 -98. (a) The ordinance cannot be sustained on the ground that it restricts only one method of communication while leaving ample alternative communication channels open.  The alternatives (primarily newspaper advertising and listing with real estate agents, which involve more cost and less autonomy than signs, are less likely to reach persons not deliberately seeking sales information, and may be less effective) are far from satisfactory.  And the ordinance is not genuinely concerned with the place (front lawns) or the manner (signs) of the speech, but rather proscribes particular types of signs based on their content because the township fears their ""primary"" effect -- that they will cause those receiving the information to act upon it.  Pp.   431 U. S. 93 -94. (b) Moreover, despite the importance of achieving the asserted goal of promoting stable, integrated housing, the ordinance cannot be upheld on the ground that it promotes an important governmental objective, since it does not appear that the ordinance was needed to achieve that objective and, in any event, the First Amendment disables the township from achieving that objective by restricting the free flow of truthful commercial information.  Pp.   431 U. S. 94 -97. 535 F.2d 786, reversed.

 FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner, who had been indicted in the Southern District of Iowa for mailing obscene materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1461, unavailingly sought to propound questions to the jury panel on  voir dire  relating to the panel members' knowledge of the contemporary community standards in that District with regard to the depiction of sex and nudity.  The case proceeded to trial and at the close of the Government's case and later, petitioner unsuccessfully moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the grounds,  inter alia,  that the Iowa obscenity statute in effect at the time of petitioner's conduct, which proscribed only the dissemination of obscene materials to minors, set forth the applicable community standard, and that the prosecution had not proved that the materials at issue had offended that standard.  Petitioner was convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding (1) that petitioner's proposed community standards questions were impermissible, since they concerned the ultimate question of guilt or innocence, rather than juror qualifications, and (2) that the issue of offense to contemporary community standards was a federal question, and was not to be determined on the basis of the state obscenity law. Held: 1. State law cannot define the contemporary community standards for appeal to the prurient interest and patent offensiveness that under  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , are applied in determining whether or not material is obscene, and the Iowa obscenity statute is therefore not conclusive as to those standards.  In federal prosecutions, such as this for violation of § 1461, those issues are fact questions for the jury, to be judged in light of its understanding of contemporary community standards.  Pp.   431 U. S. 299 -308. (a) Though state legislatures are not completely foreclosed from setting substantive limitations for obscenity cases, they cannot declare what community standards shall be, any more than they could undertake to define ""reasonableness.""   Cf. Hamling v. United States,   418 U. S. 87 ,   418 U. S. 104 -105.  Pp.   431 U. S. 301 -303. (b) The community standards aspects of § 1461 implicate federal, not state, law.  It is not material that the mailings here were solely intrastate, since § 1461 was enacted under Congress' constitutional postal power, not the commerce power.  Pp.   431 U. S. 303 -305.  (c) Obscenity convictions remain reviewable on various grounds.  Pp.   431 U. S. 305 -306. (d) This Court's holding that the Iowa statute (which was properly admitted into evidence) is not conclusive on the issue of contemporary community standards does not nullify state law, but a State's right not to regulate in the obscenity field cannot correlatively compel the Federal Government to allow the mails to be used to send obscene materials into that State.  Pp.   431 U. S. 306 -307. 2. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to ask the questions tendered by petitioner for  voir dire  about the jurors' understanding of community standards, which were no more appropriate than a request for a description of the meaning of ""reasonableness"" would have been.  P.   431 U. S. 308 . 3. Section 1461 is not unconstitutionally vague as applied here, since the type of conduct covered by the statute can be ascertained with sufficient ease to avoid due process pitfalls.  Cf.  Hamling v. United States,  supra.  pp. 30309. Affirmed. BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and WHITE, POWELL, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.

 FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT
 Syllabus   Petitioner, who was convicted of selling obscene film in violation of California law, contends that portions of the instructions to the jury violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, claiming that the instructions (1) allowed the jury to convict him even though it might otherwise have found that the film was protected under the standards of  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , because the instructions permitted the jury to consider motives of commercial exploitation on the part of persons in the chain of distribution other than petitioner, and (2) violated the prohibition against  ex post facto  laws, and the fair warning requirement of  Bouie v. Columbia.,   378 U. S. 347 .  The challenged instruction permitted the jury, in determining whether the film was utterly without redeeming social importance, to consider the circumstances of the sale and distribution, particularly whether such circumstances indicated that the film was being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal.   Held: 1. The instruction violated no First Amendment rights of the petitioner.  The circumstances of distribution of the material are relevant from the standpoint of whether public confrontation with potentially offensive aspects of the material is being forced, and are ""equally relevant to determining whether social importance claimed for material in the courtroom was, in the circumstances, pretense or reality -- whether it was the basis upon which it was traded in the marketplace or a spurious claim for litigation purposes."" Ginzburg v. United States,   383 U. S. 463 ,   383 U. S. 470 .   See also Hamling v. United States,   418 U. S. 87 ,   418 U. S. 130 .  Pp.   431 U. S. 598 -599. 2. Though the section of the California Penal Code that authorized the challenged instruction was enacted after part of the conduct for which petitioner was convicted but prior to his trial, that section does not create any new substantive offense, but merely declares what type of evidence may be received and considered by the jury in deciding whether the allegedly obscene material was ""utterly without redeeming social importance.""   People v. Noroff,   67 Cal. 2d 791 , 433 P.2d 479, relied on by petitioner in support of his  ex post facto  claim, did not   disapprove of any use of evidence of pandering for its probative value on the obscenity issue, but merely rejected the concept of pandering of nonobscene material as a separate crime under sate law.  Pp.   431 U. S. 599 -601. 3. There was no change in the interpretation of the elements of the substantive offense prohibited by California law, and  Bouie, supra,  is therefore inapplicable.

Illinois No. 76-415 Argued April 27, 1977 Decided June 9, 1977 431 U.S. 767 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS
 Syllabus   Prior to the decision in  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , appellant was convicted of selling obscene sado-masochistic materials in violation of the Illinois obscenity statute forbidding the sale of obscene matter and providing that ""[a] thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters."" The conviction was affirmed after  Miller,  the Illinois Supreme Court rejecting appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute for failure to conform to  Miller  standards, as well as his claim that the publications in question were not obscene. Held: 1. The Illinois statute is not unconstitutionally vague as failing to give appellant notice that materials dealing with the kind of sexual conduct involved here could not be legally sold in the State, where (whether or not the State has complied with  Miller's  requirement that the sexual conduct that may not be depicted must be specifically defined by applicable state law as written or authoritatively construed) appellant had ample guidance from a previous decision of the Illinois Supreme Court making it clear that his conduct did not conform to Illinois law.  Pp.   431 U. S. 771 -773. 2. Sado-masochistic materials are the kind of materials that may be proscribed by state law,  Mishkin v. New York,   383 U. S. 502 , even though they were not expressly included within the examples of the kinds of sexually explicit representations that  Miller  used to explicate the aspect of its obscenity definition dealing with patently offensive depictions of specifically defined sexual conduct.  P.   431 U. S. 773 . 3. The materials in question were properly found by the courts below to be obscene under the Illinois statute, which conforms to the  Miller  standards, except that it retains the stricter ""redeeming social value"" obscenity criterion announced in  Memoirs v. Massachusetts,   383 U. S. 413 .  P.   431 U. S. 773 . 4. The Illinois statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad for failure to state specifically the kinds of sexual conduct the description or representation of which the State intends to proscribe, where it appears that in prior decisions the Illinois Supreme Court, although not expressly   describing the kinds of sexual conduct intended to be referred to under the  Miller  guideline requiring inquiry ""whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law,"" expressly incorporated such guideline as part of the law, and thereby intended as well to adopt the  Miller  explanatory examples, which gave substantive meaning to such guideline by indicating the kinds of material within its reach.

 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA
 Syllabus   Appellee prisoners' labor union brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that its First Amendment and equal protection rights were violated by regulations promulgated by the North Carolina Department of Correction that prohibited prisoners from soliciting other inmates to join the Union and barred Union meetings and bulk mailings concerning the Union from outside sources.  A three-judge District Court, which noted that appellants had ""permitted"" inmates to join the Union, granted substantial injunctive relief, having concluded that prohibiting inmate-to-inmate solicitation ""border[ed] on the irrational,"" and that, since bulk mailings to and meetings with inmates by the Jaycees, Alcoholics Anonymous, and, in one institution, the Boy Scouts (hereafter collectively ""service organizations"") had been permitted, appellants, absent a showing of detriment to penological objectives, ""may not pick and choose depending on [their] approval or disapproval of the message or purpose of the group."" Held: 1. The challenged regulations do not violate the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  Pp.   433 U. S. 125 -133. (a) The fact of confinement and the needs of the penal institution impose limitations on constitutional rights, including those derived from the First Amendment,  Pell v. Procunier,   417 U. S. 817 ,   417 U. S. 822 , perhaps the most obvious of which is associational rights that the First Amendment protects outside of prison walls.  Pp.   433 U. S. 125 -126. (b) The District Court overstated what appellants' concession as to true membership entailed -- appellants permitted membership in the Union (which involved no dues or obligations) because of the reasonable assumption that the individual could believe what he chose to believe, but appellants never acquiesced in, or permitted, group activity by the Union, and the ban on inmate solicitation and group meetings was rationally related to the reasonable objectives of prison administration.  Pp.   433 U. S. 126 -129. (c) First Amendment speech rights are barely implicated here, mail   rights themselves not being involved, but only the cost savings through bulk mailings.  Pp.   433 U. S. 130 -131. (d) The prohibition on inmate-to-inmate solicitation does not unduly abridge inmates' free speech rights.  If the prison officials are otherwise entitled to control organized union activity within the confines of a prison, the solicitation ban is not impermissible under the First Amendment, for such a prohibition is both reasonable and necessary.   Pell v. Procunier, supra  at   417 U. S. 822 .  Pp.   433 U. S. 131 -132. (e) First Amendment associational rights are also not unduly abridged here.  Appellants' conclusion that the presence of a prisoners' union would be detrimental to prison order and security has not been conclusively shown to be wrong, and the regulations drafted were no broader than necessary to meet the perceived threat of group meetings and organizational activity to such order and security.  Pp.   433 U. S. 132 -133. 2. Appellants' prohibition against the receipt by and distribution to the inmates of bulk mail from the Union as well as the prohibition of Union meetings among inmates whereas the service organizations were given bulk mailing and meeting rights, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  The prison does not constitute a ""public forum,"" and appellants demonstrated a rational basis for distinguishing between the Union (which occupied an adversary role and espoused a purpose illegal under North Carolina law) and the service organizations (which performed rehabilitation services).

 Syllabus   Appellants, citizens and taxpayers of Ohio, brought this action against appellees, certain state officials and others, challenging the constitutionality of all but one of the provisions of Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 3317.06 (Supp. 1976) authorizing various forms of aid to nonpublic schools, most of which are sectarian.  The Ohio scheme authorizes funding for use of nonpublic schoolchildren within the district where the nonpublic school is located for the following purposes:  (1) purchasing secular textbooks approved by the superintendent of public instruction for use in public schools for loan to the children or their parents, on the request of either, made to the nonpublic school (§ 3317.06(A)); (2) supplying such standardized tests and scoring services as are used in the public schools, with nonpublic school personnel not being involved in the test drafting or scoring, and no financial aid being involved (§ 3317.06 (J)); (3) providing speech and hearing diagnostic services and diagnostic psychological services in the nonpublic schools, with the personnel (except for physicians) performing the services being local board of education employees, physicians being hired on a contract basis, and treatment to be administered on nonpublic school premises (§§ 3317.06(D), (F)); (4) supplying to students needing specialized attention therapeutic, guidance, and remedial services by employees of the local board of education or the State Department of Health, the services to be performed only in public schools, public centers, or in mobile units located off nonpublic school premises (§§ 3317.06 (G), (H), (I), (K)); (5) purchasing and loaning to pupils or their parents upon individual request instructional materials and instructional equipment of the kind used in the public schools and that is ""incapable of diversion to religious use"" (§§ 3317.06(B), (C)); and (6) providing field trip transportation and services such as are provided to public school students, special contract transportation being permissible if school district buses are unavailable (§ 3317.06(L)).  A three-judge District Court held the statute constitutional in all respects. Held:   Those portions of § 3317.06 authorizing the State to provide nonpublic school pupils with books, standardized testing and scoring, diagnostic services, and therapeutic and remedial services are constitutional.  Those portions   relating to instructional materials and equipment and field trip services are unconstitutional.  Pp.   433 U. S. 235 -255;   433 U. S. 255 . 417 F.

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   After appellant had resigned as President of the United States, he executed a depository agreement with the Administrator of General Services that provided for the storage near appellant's California home of Presidential materials (an estimated 42 million pages of documents and 880 tape recordings) accumulated during appellant's terms of office.  Under this agreement, neither appellant nor the General Services Administration (GSA) could gain access to the materials without the other's consent.  Appellant was not to withdraw any original writing for three years, although he could make and withdraw copies.  After the initial three-year period, he could withdraw any of the materials except tape recordings.  With respect to the tape recordings, appellant agreed not to withdraw the originals for five years, and to make reproductions only by mutual agreement.  Following this five-year period, the Administrator would destroy such tapes as appellant directed, and all of the tapes were to be destroyed at appellant's death or after the expiration of 10 years, whichever occurred first.  Shortly after the public announcement of this agreement, a bill was introduced in Congress designed to abrogate it, and, about three months later, this bill was enacted as the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (Act), and was signed into law by President Ford.  The Act directs the Administrator of GSA to take custody of appellant's Presidential materials and have them screened by Government archivists in order to return to appellant those personal and private in nature and to preserve those having historical value and to make the materials available for use in judicial proceedings subject to ""any rights, defenses or privileges which the Federal Government or any person may invoke.""  The Administrator is also directed to promulgate regulations to govern eventual public access to some of the materials.  These regulations must take into account seven guidelines specified by § 104(a) of the Act, including,  inter alia,  the need to protect any person's opportunity to assert any legally or constitutionally based right or privilege and the need to return to appellant or his family materials that are personal and private in nature.  No such public access regulations have yet become effective.  The day after the   Act was signed into law, appellant filed an action in District Court challenging the Act's constitutionality on the grounds,  inter alia,  that, on its face, it violates (1) the principle of separation of powers; (2) the Presidential privilege; (3) appellant's privacy interests; (4) his First Amendment associational rights; and (5) the Bill of Attainder Clause, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the Act. Concluding that, since no public access regulations had yet taken effect, it could consider only the injury to appellant's constitutionally protected interests allegedly caused by the taking of the Presidential materials into custody and their screening by Government archivists, the District Court held that appellant's constitutional challenges were without merit, and dismissed the complaint. Held: 1. The Act does not, on its face, violate the principle of separation of powers.  Pp.   433 U. S. 441 -446. (a) The Act's regulation of the Executive Branch's function in the control of the disposition of Presidential materials does not, in itself, violate such principle, since the Executive Branch became a party to the Act's regulation when President Ford signed the Act into law and President Carter's administration, acting through the Solicitor General, urged affirmance of the District Court's judgment.  Moreover, the function remains in the Executive Branch in the person of the GSA Administrator and the Government archivists, employees of that branch.  P.   433 U. S. 441 . (b) The separate powers were not intended to operate with absolute independence, but, in determining whether the Act violates the separation of powers principle, the proper inquiry requires analysis of the extent to which the Act prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions, and only where the potential for disruption is present must it then be determined whether that impact is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within Congress' constitutional authority.  Pp.   433 U. S. 441 -443. (c) There is nothing in the Act rendering it unduly disruptive of the Executive Branch, since that branch remains in full control of the Presidential materials, the Act being facially designed to ensure that the materials can be released only when release is not barred by privileges inhering in that branch.  Pp.   433 U. S. 443 -446. 2. Neither does the Act, on its face, violate the Presidential privilege of confidentiality.  Pp.   433 U. S. 446 -455. (a) In view of the specific directions to the GSA Administrator in § 104(a) of the Act to take into account, in determining public access to the materials, ""the need to protect any party's opportunity to assert any constitutionally based right or privilege,"" and the need to return to   appellant his purely private materials, there is no reason to believe that the restrictions on public access ultimately established by regulation will not be adequate to preserve executive confidentiality.  Pp.   433 U. S. 449 -451. (b) The mere screening of the materials by Government archivists, who have previously performed the identical task for other former Presidents without any suggestion that such activity in any way interfered with executive confidentiality, will not impermissibly interfere with candid communication of views by Presidential advisers, and will be no more of an intrusion into Presidential confidentiality than the  in camera  inspection by the District Court approved in  United States v. Nixon,   418 U. S. 683 .  Pp.   433 U. S. 451 -452. (c) Given the safeguards built into the Act to prevent disclosure of materials that implicate Presidential confidentiality, the requirement that appellant's personal and private materials be returned to him, and the minimal nature of the intrusion into the confidentiality of the Presidency resulting from the archivists' viewing such materials in the course of their screening process, the claims of Presidential privilege must yield to the important congressional purposes of preserving appellant's Presidential materials and maintaining access to them for lawful governmental and historical purposes.  Pp.   433 U. S. 452 -454. 3. The Act does not unconstitutionally invade appellant's right of privacy.  While he has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his personal communications, the constitutionality of the Act must be viewed in the context of the limited intrusion of the screening process, of appellant's status as a public figure, his lack of expectation of privacy in the overwhelming majority of the materials (he having conceded that he saw no more than 200,000 items), and the virtual impossibility of segregating the apparently small quantity of private materials without comprehensive screening.  When this is combined with the Act's sensitivity to appellant's legitimate privacy interests, the unblemished record of the archivists for discretion, and the likelihood that the public access regulations to be promulgated will further moot appellant's fears that his materials will be reviewed by ""a host of persons,"" it is apparent that appellant's privacy claim has no merit.  Pp.   433 U. S. 455 -465. 4. The Act does not significantly interfere with or chill appellant's First Amendment associational rights.  His First Amendment claim is clearly outweighed by the compelling governmental interests promoted by the Act in preserving the materials.  Since archival screening is the least restrictive means of identifying the materials to be returned to appellant, the burden of that screening is the measure of the First Amendment claim, and any such burden is speculative in light of the Act's provisions protecting appellant from improper public disclosures   and guaranteeing him full judicial review before any public access is permitted.  Pp.   433 U. S. 465 -468. 5. The Act does not violate the Bill of Attainder Clause.  Pp.   433 U. S. 468 -484. (a) However expansive is the prohibition against bills of attainder, it was not intended to serve as a variant of the Equal Protection Clause, invalidating every Act by Congress or the States that burdens some persons or groups but not all other plausible individuals.  While the Bill of Attainder Clause serves as an important bulwark against tyranny, it does not do so by limiting Congress to the choice of legislating for the universe, or legislating only benefits, or not legislating at all.  Pp.   433 U. S. 468 -471. (b) The Act's specificity in referring to appellant by name does not automatically offend the Bill of Attainder Clause.  Since, at the time of the Act's passage, Congress was only concerned with the preservation of appellant's materials, the papers of former Presidents already being housed in libraries, appellant constituted a legitimate class of one, and this alone can justify Congress' decision to proceed with dispatch with respect to his materials while accepting the status of his predecessors' papers and ordering in the Public Documents Act the further consideration of generalized standards to govern his successors.  Pp.   433 U. S. 471 -472. (c) Congress, by lodging appellant's materials in the GSA's custody pending their screening by Government archivists and the promulgation of further regulations, did not ""inflict punishment"" within the historical meaning of bills of attainder.  Pp.   433 U. S. 473 -475. (d) Evaluated in terms of Congress' asserted proper purposes of the Act to preserve the availability of judicial evidence and historically relevant materials, the Act is one of nonpunitive legislative policymaking, and there is no evidence in the legislative history or in the provisions of the Act showing a congressional intent to punish appellant.

Paty No. 76-1427 Argued December 5, 1977 Decided April 19, 1978 435 U.S. 618 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF TENNESSEE
 Syllabus   Appellee Paty, a candidate for delegate to a Tennessee constitutional convention, sued in the State Chancery Court for a declaratory judgment that appellant, an opponent who was a Baptist minister, was disqualified from serving as delegate by a Tennessee statutory provision establishing the qualifications of constitutional convention delegates to be the same as those for membership in the State House of Representatives, thus invoking a Tennessee constitutional provision barring ""[m]inister[s] of the Gospel, or priest[s] of any denomination whatever.""  That court held that the statutory provision violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed, holding that the clergy disqualification imposed no burden on ""religious belief,"" and restricted ""religious action . . . [only] in the law making process of government -- where religious action is absolutely prohibited by the establishment clause. . . ."" Held:   The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded: 1. The Tennessee disqualification is directed primarily not at religious belief, but at the status, acts, and conduct of the clergy.  Therefore, the Free Exercise Clause's absolute prohibition against infringements on the ""freedom to believe"" is inapposite here.   Torcaso v. Watkins,   367 U. S. 488  (which invalidated a state requirement that an appointee to public office declare his belief in the existence of God), distinguished.  Pp.   435 U. S. 626 -627. 2. Nevertheless, the challenged provision violates appellant's First Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, because it conditions his right to the free exercise of his religion on the surrender of his right to seek office.   Sherbert v. Verner,   374 U. S. 398 ,   374 U. S. 406 .  Though justification is asserted under the Establishment Clause for the statutory restriction on the ground that, if elected to public office members of the clergy will necessarily promote the interests of one sect or thwart those of another contrary to the anti-establishment principle of neutrality, Tennessee has failed to demonstrate that its views of the dangers of   clergy participation in the political process have not lost whatever validity they may once have enjoyed.  Accordingly, there is no need to inquire whether the State's legislative goal is permissible.  Pp.   435 U. S. 626 ;   435 U. S. 627 -629."

Bellotti No. 76-1172 Argued November 9, 1977 Decided April 26, 1978 435 U.S. 765 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS
 Syllabus   Appellants, national banking associations and business corporations, wanted to spend money to publicize their views opposing a referendum proposal to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to authorize the legislature to enact a graduated personal income tax.  They brought this action challenging the constitutionality of a Massachusetts criminal statute that prohibited them and other specified business corporations from making contributions or expenditures ""for the purpose of . . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation."" The statute specified that ""[n]o question submitted to the voters solely concerning the taxation of the income, property or transactions of individuals shall be deemed materially to affect the property, business or assets of the corporation."" On April 26, 1976, the case was submitted to a single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts on an expedited basis and upon agreed facts.  Judgment was reserved, and the case was referred to the full court.  On September 22, 1976, the court directed entry of a judgment for appellee and issued its opinion upholding the constitutionality of the statute after the referendum, at which the proposal was rejected. Held: 1. The case is not rendered moot by the fact that the 1976 referendum has been held and the proposal for a constitutional amendment defeated.  The 18-month interval between legislative authorization of placement of the proposal on the ballot and its submission to the voters was too short for appellants to obtain complete judicial review, and likely would be too short in any future challenge to the statute; and in view of the number of times that such a proposal has been submitted to the electorate, there is reasonable expectation that appellants again will be subjected to the threat of prosecution under the statute.   Weinstein v. Bradford,   423 U. S. 147 ,   423 U. S. 149 .  Pp.   435 U. S. 774 -775. 2. The portion of the Massachusetts statute at issue violates the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  Pp.   435 U. S. 775 -795.  (a) The expression proposed by appellants, namely, the expression of views on an issue of public importance, is at the heart of the First Amendment's concern.  There is no support in the First or Fourteenth Amendment, or in this Court's decisions, for the proposition that such speech loses the protection otherwise afforded it by the First Amendment simply because its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to a court's satisfaction, a material effect on its business.  Although appellee suggests that this Court's decisions generally have extended First Amendment rights only to corporations in the business of communications or which foster the self-expression of individuals, those decisions were not based on the rationale that the challenged communication materially affected the company's business.  They were based, at least in part, on the Amendment's protection of public discussion and the dissemination of information and ideas.  Similarly, commercial speech is accorded some constitutional protection not so much because it pertains to the seller's business as because it furthers the societal interest in the ""free flow of commercial information.""

(b) The asserted justifications for the challenged statute cannot survive the exacting scrutiny required when the legislative prohibition is directed at speech itself and speech on a public issue.  This statute cannot be justified by the State's asserted interest in sustaining the active role of the individual citizen in the electoral process and preventing diminution of his confidence in government.  Even if it were permissible to silence one segment of society upon a sufficient showing of imminent danger, there has been no showing that the relative voice of corporations has been overwhelming or even significant in influencing referenda in Massachusetts, or that there has been any threat to the confidence of the citizenry in government.  And the risk of corruption perceived in this Court's decisions involving candidate elections is not present in a popular vote on a public issue.  Nor can the statute be justified on the asserted ground that it protects the rights of shareholders whose views differ from those expressed by management on behalf of the corporation.  The statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive in serving this purpose, and therefore could not be sustained even if the purpose itself were deemed compelling.  Pp.   435 U.

 Syllabus   A Virginia statute makes it a crime to divulge information regarding proceedings before a state judicial review commission that is authorized to hear complaints about judges' disability or misconduct.  For printing in its newspaper an article accurately reporting on a pending inquiry by the commission and identifying the judge whose conduct was being investigated, appellant publisher was convicted of violating the statute.  Rejecting appellant's contention that the statute violated the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed. Held:   The First Amendment does not permit the criminal punishment of third persons who are strangers to proceedings before such a commission for divulging or publishing truthful information regarding confidential proceedings of the commission.  Pp.   435 U. S. 837 -845. (a) A major purpose of the First Amendment is to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs, which includes discussion of the operations of the courts and judicial conduct, and the article published by appellant's newspaper served the interests of public scrutiny of such matters.  Pp.   435 U. S. 838 -839. (b) The question is not whether the confidentiality of commission proceedings serves legitimate state interests, but whether those interests are sufficient to justify encroaching on First Amendment guarantees that the imposition of criminal sanctions entails.  Injury to the reputation of judges or the institutional reputation of courts is not sufficient to justify ""repressing speech that would otherwise be free.""   New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 ,   376 U. S. 272 -273.  Pp.   435 U. S. 839 -842. (c) The mere fact that the legislature found a clear and present danger to the orderly administration of justice justifying enactment of the challenged statute did not preclude the necessity of proof that such danger existed.  This Court has consistently rejected the argument that out-of-court comments on pending cases or grand jury investigations constituted a clear and present danger to the administration of justice.   See Bridges v. California,   314 U. S. 252 ;  Pennekamp v. Florida,   328 U. S. 331 ;  Craig v. Harney,   331 U. S. 367 ;  Wood v. Georgia,   370 U. S. 375 .  If the ""clear and present danger"" test could not be satisfied in those cases,  a fortiori  it could not be satisfied here.  Pp.   435 U. S. 842 -845.  (d) Much of the risk to the orderly administration of justice can be eliminated through careful internal procedures to protect the confidentiality of commission proceedings.  P.   435 U.

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner was convicted of mailing obscene materials and advertising brochures for such materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1461 (1976 ed.), and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Since the materials were mailed prior to 1973, he was tried under the standards of  Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 , and  Memoirs v. Massachusetts,   383 U. S. 413 , rather than under those of  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 .  He claims that the trial court's instructions to the jury were improper because they included children and sensitive persons within the definition of the community by whose standards obscenity was to be judged; charged that members of deviant sexual groups could be considered in determining whether the materials appealed to prurient interest in sex; and also charged that pandering could be considered in determining whether the materials were obscene. Held: 1. Children are not to be included as part of the ""community"" as that term relates to the ""obscene materials"" proscribed by § 1461, and hence it was error to instruct the jury that children are part of the relevant community.  A jury conscientiously striving to define such community, the ""average person,"" by whose standards obscenity is to be judged, might very well reach a much lower ""average"" when children are part of the equation than it would if it restricted its consideration to the effect of allegedly obscene materials on adults.  Pp.   436 U. S. 296 -298. 2. However, inclusion of ""sensitive persons"" in the charge advising the jury of whom the community consists was not error.  In the context of this case, the community includes all adults who compose it, and a jury can consider them all in determining the relevant community standards, the vice being in focusing upon the most susceptible or sensitive members, rather than in merely including them, as the trial court did, along with all others in the community.  Pp.   436 U. S. 298 -301. 3. Nor was the instruction as to deviant groups improper.  Nothing prevents a court from giving an instruction on prurient appeal to such groups as part of an instruction pertaining to appeal to the average person when the evidence, as here, would support such a charge.  Pp.   436 U. S. 301 -303.  4. The pandering instruction, which permitted the jury to consider the touting descriptions in the advertising brochures, along with the materials themselves, to determine whether the materials were intended to appeal to the recipient's prurient interest in sex,  i.e.,  whether they were ""commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of their prurient appeal,""  Ginzburg v. United States,   383 U. S. 463 ,   383 U. S. 466 , was proper in light of the evidence.  To aid a jury in determining whether materials are obscene, the methods of their creation, promotion, or dissemination are relevant.  Pp.   436 U. S. 303 -304. 551 F.2d 1155, reversed and remanded.

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   After respondent broadcasting company, KQED, had been refused permission to inspect and take photographs at a portion (Little Greystone) of a county jail where a prisoner's suicide reportedly had occurred and where conditions were assertedly responsible for prisoners' problems, respondents brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against petitioner, who supervised the jail, claiming deprivation of their First Amendment rights.  Thereafter petitioner announced a program of regular monthly tours open to the public, including media reporters, of parts of the jail (but not including Little Greystone).  Cameras or tape recorders were not allowed on the tours, nor were interviews with inmates.  Persons, including members of the media, who knew a prisoner at the jail could visit him.  The District Court preliminarily enjoined petitioner from denying KQED news personnel and responsible news media representatives reasonable access to the jail, including Little Greystone, and from preventing their using photographic or sound equipment or from conducting inmate interviews.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  Pp.   438 U. S. 8 -16;   438 U. S. 16 -19. 546 F.2d 284, reversed and remanded. THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that neither the First Amendment nor the Fourteenth Amendment provides a right of access to government information   or sources of information within the government's control.  The news media have no constitutional right of access to the county jail, over and above that of other persons, to interview inmates and make sound recordings, films, and photographs for publication and broadcasting by newspapers, radio, and television.

(a) The public importance of conditions in penal facilities and the media's role of providing information afford no basis for reading into the Constitution a right of the public or the media to enter those institutions, gather information, and take pictures for broadcast purposes.  The First Amendment does not guarantee a right of access to sources of information within government control.   Grosjean v. American Press,   297 U. S. 233 ,  Mills v. Alabama,   384 U. S. 214 , and other cases relied upon by respondents, concerned the freedom of the press to communicate information already obtained, but neither  Grosjean  nor  Mills  indicated that the Constitution compels the government to provide the press with information.  Pp.   438 U. S. 8 -12. (b) Whether the government should open penal institutions in the manner sought by respondents is a matter for legislative, not judicial, resolution.  Pp.   438 U. S. 12 -16."

 FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A radio station of respondent Pacifica Foundation (hereinafter respondent) made an afternoon broadcast of a satiric monologue, entitled ""Filthy Words,"" which listed and repeated a variety of colloquial uses of ""words you couldn't say on the public airwaves.""  A father who heard the broadcast while driving with his young son complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which, after forwarding the complaint for comment to and receiving a response from respondent, issued a declaratory order granting the complaint.  While not imposing formal sanctions, the FCC stated that the order would be ""associated with the station's license file, and, in the event subsequent complaints are received, the Commission will then decide whether it should utilize any of the available sanctions it has been granted by Congress."" In its memorandum opinion, the FCC stated that it intended to ""clarify the standards which will be utilized in considering"" the growing number of complaints about indecent radio broadcasts, and it advanced several reasons for treating that type of speech differently from other forms of expression.  The FCC found a power to regulate indecent broadcasting,  inter alia,  in 18 U.S.C. § 1464 (1976 ed.), which forbids the use of ""any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio communications.""  The FCC characterized the language of the monologue as ""patently offensive,"" though not necessarily obscene, and expressed the opinion that it should be regulated by principles analogous to the law of nuisance, where the ""law generally speaks to channeling behavior, rather than actually prohibiting it.""  The FCC found that certain words in the monologue depicted sexual and excretory activities in a particularly offensive manner, noted that they were broadcast in the early afternoon, ""when children are undoubtedly in the audience,"" and concluded that the language, as broadcast, was indecent and prohibited by § 1464.  A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, one judge concluding that the FCC's action was invalid either on the ground that the order constituted censorship, which was expressly forbidden by § 326 of the Communications Act of 1934, or on the ground that the FCC's opinion was the functional equivalent of   a rule, and, as such, was ""overbroad.""  Another judge, who felt that § 326's censorship provision did not apply to broadcasts forbidden by § 1464, concluded that § 1464, construed narrowly as it has to be, covers only language that is obscene or otherwise unprotected by the First Amendment.  The third judge, dissenting, concluded that the FCC had correctly condemned the daytime broadcast as indecent.  Respondent contends that the broadcast was not indecent within the meaning of the statute because of the absence of prurient appeal. Held:   The judgment is reversed.  Pp.   438 U.

 FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   After petitioner was dismissed from her employment as a teacher, she intervened in a desegregation action against respondent School District, seeking reinstatement on the ground,  inter alia,  that her dismissal infringed her right of free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  In an effort to justify the dismissal, the School District introduced evidence of,  inter alia,  a series of private encounters between petitioner and the school principal in which petitioner allegedly made ""petty and unreasonable demands"" in a manner variously described by the principal as ""insulting,"" ""hostile,"" ""loud,"" and ""arrogant.""  Concluding that the primary reason for the dismissal was petitioner's criticism of the School District's practices and policies, which she conceived to be racially discriminatory, the District Court held that the dismissal violated petitioner's First Amendment rights and ordered her reinstatement.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, under  Pickering v. Board of Education,   391 U. S. 563 ;  Perry v. Sindermann,   408 U. S. 593 ; and  Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,   429 U. S. 274 , petitioner's complaints and opinions were not protected by the First Amendment because they were expressed privately to the principal, and because there is no constitutional right to ""press even  good' ideas on an unwilling recipient.""
 Held:   A public employee does not forfeit his First Amendment protection against governmental abridgment of freedom of speech when he arranges to communicate privately with his employer, rather than to express his views publicly.  Pp.   439 U. S. 413 -417. (a)  Pickering, Perry,  and  Mt. Healthy  do not support the Court of Appeals' conclusion that private expression is unprotected by the First Amendment.  The fact that each of those cases involved public expression by the employee was not critical to the decision.  Pp.   439 U. S. 414 -415. (b) Nor is the Court of Appeals' view supported by the ""captive audience"" rationale, since the principal, having opened his office door to petitioner, was hardly in a position to argue that he was the "" unwilling  recipient"" of her views.

 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
 Syllabus   Section 5.13(d) of the Texas Optometry Act prohibits the practice of optometry under a trade name, and § 2.02 requires that four of the six members of the Texas Optometry Board, which regulates the practice of optometry in the State, be members of the Texas Optometric Association (TOA), a professional organization of optometrists.  Rogers, a Board member but ineligible for membership in TOA because of noncompliance with the code of ethics required for membership, brought an action challenging the constitutionality of these provisions.  A three-judge District Court held that § 2.02 is related reasonably to the State's purpose of ensuring enforcement of the Act and therefore constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but that § 5.13(d) is an unconstitutional restriction of the ""free flow of commercial information"" under the First Amendment. Held: 1. Section 5.13(d) is constitutional.   Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,   425 U. S. 748 , and  Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,   433 U. S. 350 , distinguished.  Pp.   440 U. S. 8 -16. (a) The use of a trade name in connection with optometrical practice conveys no information about the price and nature of the services offered by an optometrist until it acquires meaning over a period of time   by associations formed in the minds of the public between the name and some standard of price or quality.  Because these ill-defined associations of trade names with price and quality information can be manipulated by the users.of trade names, there is a significant possibility that trade names will be used to mislead the public.  Pp.   440 U. S. 11 -13. (b) The State's interest in protecting the public from such deceptive and misleading use of optometrical trade names is substantial and well demonstrated in this case, and the prohibition against the use of trade names is a constitutionally permissible regulation in furtherance of this interest.  Rather than stifling commercial speech, such prohibition ensures that information regarding optometrical services will be communicated more fully and accurately to consumers than it had been in the past.  Pp.   440 U. S. 13 -16. 2. Section 2.02 is also constitutional.  Pp.   440 U. S. 17 -19. (a) The history of the Texas Optometry Act shows that such provision is related reasonably to the State's legitimate purpose of securing a regulatory board that will administer the Act faithfully.  Pp.   440 U. S. 17 -18. (b) While Rogers has a constitutional right to a fair and impartial hearing in any disciplinary proceeding conducted against him by the Texas Optometry Board, his challenge to the fairness of the Board does not arise from any disciplinary proceeding against him.

 FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner instituted a diversity action in Federal District Court against the respondents, a television network and two of its employees, and a magazine, alleging that a program aired by the network and an article published by the magazine defamed him.  Petitioner conceded that, because he was a ""public figure"" the First and Fourteenth Amendments precluded recovery absent proof that respondents had published damaging falsehoods with ""actual malice"" -- that is, with knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not.   See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , and subsequent decisions of this Court.  Preparing to prove his case in light of these requirements, petitioner deposed one of the network employees at length and sought an order to compel answers to a variety of questions to which response was refused on the ground that the First Amendment protected against inquiry into the state of mind of those who edit, produce, or publish, and into the editorial process.  The District Court ruled that the questions were relevant and rejected the claim of constitutional privilege.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, two judges concluding that the First Amendment lent sufficient protection to the editorial processes to protect the network employee from inquiry about his thoughts, opinions, and conclusions with respect to the material gathered by him and about his conversations with his editorial colleagues. Held:   When a member of the press is alleged to have circulated damaging falsehoods and is sued for injury to the plaintiff's reputation, there is no privilege under the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press barring the plaintiff from inquiring into the editorial processes of those responsible for the publication where the inquiry will produce evidence material to the proof of a critical element of the plaintiff's cause of action.  Pp.   441 U. S. 158 -177. (a) Contrary to the views of the Court of Appeals, according an absolute privilege to the editorial process of a media defendant in a libel case is not required, authorized, or presaged by this Court's prior cases, and would substantially enhance the burden of proving actual malice, contrary to the expectations of  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,     supra; Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts,   388 U. S. 130 , and similar cases.   New York Times  and its progeny do not suggest any First Amendment restriction on the sources from which the plaintiff can obtain the necessary evidence to prove the critical elements of his cause of action, but, on the contrary, make it essential to proving liability that the plaintiff focus on the defendant's conduct and state of mind.  It is also untenable to conclude from the prior cases that, although proof of the necessary state of mind can be in the form of objective circumstances from which the ultimate fact can be inferred, plaintiffs may not inquire directly from the defendants whether they knew or suspected that their damaging publication was in error.  Pp.   441 U. S. 158 -169. (b) The case for modifying firmly established constitutional doctrine by placing beyond the plaintiff's reach a range of direct evidence relevant to proving knowing or reckless falsehood by the publisher of an alleged libel, elements that are critical to a plaintiff such as petitioner, is by no means clear and convincing.  The suggested privilege for the editorial process would constitute a substantial interference with the ability of a defamation plaintiff to establish the ingredients of malice as required by  New York Times,  and furthermore the outer boundaries of the suggested editorial privilege are difficult to perceive.  The important interests of petitioner and other defamation plaintiffs at stake in opposing the creation of the asserted privilege cannot be overridden on the ground that requiring disclosure of editorial conversations and of a reporter's conclusions about veracity of the material he has gathered will have an intolerable chilling effect on the editorial process and editorial decisionmaking.  If the claimed inhibition flows from the fear of damages liability for publishing knowing or reckless falsehoods, those effects are precisely those that have been held to be consistent with the First Amendment.  Pp.   441 U. S. 169 -175. (c) Creating a constitutional privilege foreclosing direct inquiry into the editorial process would not cure the press' problem as to escalating costs and other burdens incident to defamation litigation.  Only complete immunity from liability for defamation would effect this result, and this Court has regularly found this to be an untenable construction of the First Amendment.  Furthermore, mushrooming litigation costs, much of it due to pretrial discovery, are not peculiar to the libel and slander area.  Until and unless there are major changes in the present Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, reliance must be had on what in fact and in law are ample powers of the district judge to prevent abuse.  Pp.   441 U. S. 175 -177. 568 F.2d 974, reversed.  WHITE, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and BLACKMUN, POWELL, REHNQUIST, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

 COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Held:   The Arkansas State Highway Commission's refusal to consider employee grievances when filed by the union, rather than directly by an employee of the State Highway Department, does not violate the First Amendment.  Even assuming that the Commission's procedure would constitute an unfair labor practice if the Commission were subject to the same labor laws applicable to private employers, and that its procedure tends to impair the effectiveness of the union in representing the economic interests of its members, nevertheless, this type of ""impairment"" is not one that the Constitution forbids, the Commission not having prohibited its employees from joining together in a union, from persuading others to do so, or from advocating any particular ideas. Certiorari granted; 585 F.2d 876, reversed. PER CURIAM. In grievance proceedings initiated by employees of the Arkansas State Highway Department, the State Highway Commission will not consider a grievance unless the employee submits his written complaint directly to the designated employer representative.  The District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas found that this procedure denied the union representing the employees the ability to submit effective grievances on their behalf, and therefore violated the First Amendment.  459 F Supp. 452 (1978).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. [ Footnote 1 ]  585 F.2d   876 (1978).  We disagree with these holdings; finding no constitutional violation in the actions of the Commission or its individual members, we grant certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The First Amendment protects the right of an individual to speak freely, to advocate ideas, to associate with others, and to petition his government for redress of grievances.  And it protects the right of associations to engage in advocacy on behalf of their members.   NAACP v. Button,   371 U. S. 415  (1963);  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.,   365 U. S. 127  (1961).  The government is prohibited from infringing upon these guarantees either by a general prohibition against certain forms of advocacy,  NAACP v. Button, supra,  or by imposing sanctions for the expression of particular views it opposes,  e.g., Brandenburg v. Ohio,   395 U. S. 444  (1969);  Garrison v. Louisiana,   379 U. S. 64  (1964). But the First Amendment is not a substitute for the national labor relations laws.  As the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recognized in  Hanover Township Federation of Teachers v. Hanover Community School Corp.,  457 F.2d 456 (1972), the fact that procedures followed by a public employer in bypassing the union and dealing directly with its members might well be unfair labor practices were federal statutory law applicable hardly establishes that such procedures violate the Constitution.  The First Amendment right   to associate and to advocate ""provides no guarantee that a speech will persuade or that advocacy will be effective.""   Id.  at 461.  The public employee surely can associate and speak freely and petition openly, and he is protected by the First Amendment from retaliation for doing so.   See Pickering v. Board of Eduction,   391 U. S. 563 ,   391 U. S. 574 -575 (1968);  Shelton v. Tucker,   364 U. S. 479  (1960).  But the First Amendment does not impose any affirmative obligation on the government to listen, to respond or, in this context, to recognize the association and bargain with it. [ Footnote 2 ] In the case before us, there is no claim that the Highway Commission has prohibited its employees from joining together in a union, or from persuading others to do so, or from advocating any particular ideas.  There is, in short, no claim of retaliation or discrimination proscribed by the First Amendment.  Rather, the complaint of the union and its members is simply that the Commission refuses to consider or act upon grievances when filed by the union, rather than by the employee directly. Were public employers such as the Commission subject to the same labor laws applicable to private employers, this refusal might well constitute an unfair labor practice.  We may assume that it would and, further, that it tends to impair or undermine -- if only slightly [ Footnote 3 ] -- the effectiveness of the union   in representing the economic interests of its members.   Cf. Hanover Township, supra. But this type of ""impairment"" is not one that the Constitution prohibits.  Far from taking steps to prohibit or discourage union membership or association, all that the Commission has done in its challenged conduct is simply to ignore the union.  That it is free to do. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed. It is so ordered."

 Syllabus   Held:   A Washington statute that requires each major political party to have a State Committee consisting of two persons from each county in the State does not, by so restricting the composition of the State Committee, violate the rights of members of a political party to freedom of association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments insofar as concerns the Committee's activities involving purely internal party decisions.  None of these activities -- such as exercising the party's policymaking functions when the party's State Convention is in adjournment, directing the party's administrative apparatus, raising and distributing funds to party candidates, conducting workshops to instruct candidates on effective campaign procedures and organization, and seeking to further party objectives of influencing policy and electing its adherents to office -- is required by statute to be performed by the Committee; instead, all of the ""internal party decisions"" are made by the Committee because of delegations of authority from the party's Convention itself.  As far as the statutory scheme is concerned, there is no reason why the Convention -- instead of attempting to increase the size of the State Committee by providing for the election of members in addition to those specified by the statute -- could not create an entirely new separate committee or one, for example, composed of members of the State Committee and such additional membership as might be desired to perform the political functions now performed by the State Committee.  Thus, there can be no complaint that the party's right to govern itself has been substantially burdened by statute when the source of the complaint is the party's own decision to confer critical authority on the State Committee.

 APPEALS OF WEST VIRGINIA
 Syllabus   Respondent newspapers published articles containing the name of a juvenile who had been arrested for allegedly killing another youth.  Respondents learned of the event and the name of the alleged assailant by monitoring the police band radio frequency and by asking various eyewitnesses.  Respondents were indicted for violating a West Virginia statute which makes it a crime for a newspaper to publish, without the written approval of the juvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender.  The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals granted a writ of prohibition against petitioners, the prosecuting attorney and the Circuit Judges of Kanawha County, W.Va., holding that the statute on which the indictment was based violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Held:   The State cannot, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, punish the truthful publication of an alleged juvenile delinquent's name lawfully obtained by a newspaper.  The asserted state interest in protecting the anonymity of the juvenile offender to further his rehabilitation cannot justify the statute's imposition of criminal sanctions for publication of a juvenile's name lawfully obtained.  Pp.   443 U.S. 101 -106. (a) Whether the statute is viewed as a prior restraint by authorizing the juvenile judge to permit publication or as a penal sanction for publishing lawfully obtained, truthful information is not dispositive, because even the latter action requires the highest form of state interest to sustain its validity.  When a state attempts to punish publication after the event, it must demonstrate that its punitive action was necessary to further the state interests asserted.   Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia,   435 U. S. 829 .  Pp.   443 U.S. 101 -104. (b) Respondents' First Amendment rights prevail over the State's interest in protecting juveniles.   Cf. Davis v. Alaska,   415 U. S. 308 .  Even assuming that the statute served a state interest of the highest order, the statute does not accomplish its stated purpose, since it does not restrict the electronic media or any form of publication except ""newspapers.""

 FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent United States Senator publicizes examples of wasteful governmental spending by awarding his ""Golden Fleece of the Month Award.""  One such award was given to federal agencies that had funded petitioner scientist's study of emotional behavior in which he sought an objective measure of aggression, concentrating upon the behavior patterns of certain animals.  The award was announced in a speech prepared with the help of respondent legislative assistant, the text of which was incorporated in a widely distributed press release.  Subsequently, the award was also referred to in newsletters sent out by the Senator, in a television interview program on which he appeared, and in telephone calls made by the legislative assistant to the sponsoring federal agencies.  Petitioner sued respondents in Federal District Court for defamation, alleging,  inter alia,  that in making the award and publicizing it nationwide, respondents had damaged him in his professional and academic standing.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that the Speech or Debate Clause afforded absolute immunity for investigating the funding of petitioner's research, for the speech in the Senate, and for the press release, since it fell within the ""informing function"" of Congress.  The court further held that petitioner was a ""public figure"" for purposes of determining respondents' liability; that respondents were protected by the First Amendment, thereby requiring petitioner to prove ""actual malice""; and that, based on the depositions, affidavits, and pleadings, there was no genuine issue of material fact on the issue of actual malice, neither respondents' failure to investigate nor unfair editing and summarizing being sufficient to establish ""actual malice.""  Finally, the court held that, even if petitioner were found to be a ""private person,"" relevant state law required a summary judgment for respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Speech or Debate Clause protected the statements made in the press release and newsletters and that, although the followup telephone calls and the statements made on television were not protected by that Clause, they were protected by the First Amendment, since petitioner was a ""public figure,"" and that on the record there was no showing of ""actual malice.""  Held: 1. While this Court's practice is to avoid reaching constitutional questions if a dispositive nonconstitutional ground is available, special considerations in this case mandate that the constitutional questions first be resolved.  If respondents have immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause, no other questions need be considered.  And where it appears that the Court of Appeals would not affirm the District Court's state law holding, so that the appeal could not be decided without reaching the First Amendment issue, that issue will also be reached here.  Pp.   443 U. S. 122 -123. 2. The Speech or Debate Clause does not protect transmittal of information by individual Members of Congress by press releases and newsletters.  Pp.   443 U. S. 123 -133. (a) There is nothing in the history of the Clause or its language suggesting any intent to create an absolute privilege from liability or suit for defamatory statements made outside the legislative Chambers; precedents support the conclusion that a Member may be held liable for republishing defamatory statements originally made in the Chamber.  Pp.   443 U. S. 127 -130. (b) Neither the newsletters nor the press release here was ""essential to the deliberation of the Senate,"" and neither was part of the deliberative process.   Gravel v. United States,   408 U. S. 606 ;  Doe v. McMillan,   412 U. S. 306 .  P.   443 U. S. 130 . (c) The newsletters and press release were not privileged as part of the ""informing function"" of Members of Congress to tell the public about their activities.  Individual Members' transmittal of information about their activities by press releases and newsletters is not part of the legislative function or the deliberations that make up the legislative process; in contrast to voting and preparing committee reports, which are part of Congress' function to inform itself, newsletters and press releases are primarily means of informing those outside t.he legislative forum, and represent the views and will of a single Member.   Doe v. McMillan, supra,  distinguished.  Pp.   443 U. S. 132 -133. 3. Petitioner is not a ""public figure"" so as to make the ""actual malice"" standard of proof of  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , applicable.  Neither the fact that local newspapers reported the federal grants to petitioner for his research nor the fact that he had access to the news media as shown by reports of his response to the announcement of the Golden Fleece Award demonstrates that he was a public figure prior to the controversy engendered by that award.  His access, such as it was, came after the alleged libel, and was limited to responding to the announcement of the award.  Those charged with alleged defamation cannot, by their own conduct, create their own defense by making   the claimant a public figure.  Nor is the concern about public expenditures sufficient to make petitioner a public figure, petitioner at no time having assumed any role of public prominence in the broad question of such concern.

 Syllabus   Air Force regulations require members of that service to obtain approval from their commanders before circulating petitions on Air Force bases.  Respondent Air Force Reserve officer was removed from active duty for distributing on an Air Force base petitions to Members of Congress and the Secretary of Defense, which complained about Air Force grooming standards, without having obtained approval of the base commander as required by the regulations.  Respondent then brought suit in District Court challenging the validity of the regulations.  That court granted summary judgment for respondent, declaring the regulations facially invalid, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   The regulations are not invalid on their face.  Pp.   444 U. S. 353 -361. (a) Such regulations do not violate the First Amendment.   Greer v. Spock,   424 U. S. 828 .  They protect a substantial Government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression -- the interest in maintaining the respect for duty and discipline so vital to military effectiveness -- and restrict speech no more than is reasonably necessary to protect such interest.  Since a military commander is charged with maintaining morale, discipline, and readiness, he must have authority over the distribution of materials that could affect adversely these essential attributes of an effective military force.  Pp.   444 U. S. 353 -358. (b) Nor do the regulations violate 10 U.S.C. § 1034, which proscribes unwarranted restrictions on a serviceman's right to communicate with a Member of Congress.  As § 1034's legislative history makes clear, Congress enacted the statute to ensure that an individual member of the Armed Services could write to his elected representatives without sending his communication through official channels, and not to protect the circulation of collective petitions within a military base.  Permitting an individual serviceman to submit a petition directly to any Member of Congress serves § 1034's legislative purpose without unnecessarily endangering a commander's ability to preserve morale and good order among his troops.

 COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Held:   A former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, who had agreed not to divulge classified information without authorization and not to publish any information relating to the Agency without prepublication clearance, breached a fiduciary obligation when he published a book about certain Agency activities without submitting his manuscript for prepublication review.  The proceeds of his breach are impressed with a constructive trust for the benefit of the Government. Certiorari granted; 595 F.2d 926, reversed in part and remanded. PER CURIAM. In No. 78-1871, Frank W. Snepp III seeks review of a judgment enforcing an agreement that he signed when he accepted employment with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  He also contends that punitive damages are an inappropriate remedy for the breach of his promise to submit all writings about the Agency for prepublication review.  In No. 79-265, the United States conditionally cross-petitions from a judgment refusing to find that profits attributable to Snepp's breach.are impressed with a constructive trust.  We grant the petitions for certiorari in order to correct the judgment from which both parties seek relief. I Based on his experiences as a CIA agent, Snepp published a book about certain CIA activities in South Vietnam.  Snepp published the account without submitting it to the Agency for prepublication review.  As an express condition of his employment with the CIA in 1968, however, Snepp had   executed an agreement promising that he would ""not . . . publish . . . any information or material relating to the Agency, its activities or intelligence activities generally, either during or after the term of [his] employment . . . without specific prior approval by the Agency."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 78-1871, p. 59a.  The promise was an integral part of Snepp's concurrent undertaking ""not to disclose any classified information relating to the Agency without proper authorization.""   Id.  at 58a. [ Footnote 1 ]  Thus, Snepp had pledged not to divulge classified information and not to publish any information without prepublication clearance.  The Government brought this suit to enforce Snepp's agreement.  It sought a declaration that Snepp had breached the contract, an injunction requiring Snepp to submit future writings for prepublication review, and an order imposing a constructive trust for the Government's benefit on all profits that Snepp might earn from publishing the book in violation of his fiduciary obligations to the Agency. [ Footnote 2 ] The District Court found that Snepp had ""willfully, deliberately and surreptitiously breached his position of trust with the CIA and the [1968] secrecy agreement"" by publishing his book without submitting it for prepublication review.   456 F. Supp. 176 , 179 (ED Va.1978).  The court also found that Snepp deliberately misled CIA officials into believing that he would submit the book for prepublication clearance.  Finally, the court determined as a fact that publication of the book had ""caused the United States irreparable harm and loss.""     Id.  at 180. he District Court therefore enjoined future breaches of Snepp's agreement and imposed a constructive trust on Snepp's profits. The Court of Appeals accepted the findings of the District Court and agreed that Snepp had breached a valid contract. [ Footnote 3 ]  It specifically affirmed the finding that Snepp's failure to submit his manuscript for prepublication review had inflicted ""irreparable harm"" on intelligence activities vital to our national security.  595 F.2d 926, 935 (CA4 1979).  Thus, the court upheld the injunction against future violations of Snepp's prepublication obligation.  The court, however, concluded that the record did not support imposition of a constructive trust.  The conclusion rested on the court's perception   that Snepp had a First Amendment right to publish unclassified information and the Government's concession -- for the purposes of this litigation -- that Snepp's book divulged no classified intelligence.   Id.  at 935-936. [ Footnote 4 ]  In other words, the court thought that Snepp's fiduciary obligation extended only to preserving the confidentiality of classified material.  It therefore limited recovery to nominal damages and to the possibility of punitive damages if the Government -- in a jury trial -- could prove tortious conduct. Judge Hoffman, sitting by designation, dissented from the refusal to find a constructive trust.  The 1968 agreement, he wrote, ""was no ordinary contract; it gave life to a fiduciary relationship and invested in Snepp the trust of the CIA.""   Id.  at 938.  Prepublication clearance was part of Snepp's undertaking to protect confidences associated with his trust.  Punitive damages, Judge Hoffman argued, were both a speculative and inappropriate remedy for Snepp's breach.  We agree with Judge Hoffman that Snepp breached a fiduciary obligation and that the proceeds of his breach are impressed with a constructive trust. II Snepp's employment with the CIA involved an extremely high degree of trust.  In the opening sentence of the agreement that he signed, Snepp explicitly recognized that he was entering a trust relationship. [ Footnote 5 ]  The trust agreement specifically   imposed the obligation not to publish any information relating to the Agency without submitting the information for clearance.  Snepp stipulated at trial that -- after undertaking this obligation -- he had been ""assigned to various positions of trust"" and that he had been granted ""frequent access to classified information, including information regarding intelligence sources and methods.""  456 F. Supp.  at 178. [ Footnote 6 ]  Snepp published his book about CIA activities on the basis of this background and exposure.  He deliberately and surreptitiously violated his obligation to submit all material for prepublication review.  Thus, he exposed the classified information with which he had been entrusted to the risk of disclosure. Whether Snepp violated his trust does not depend upon whether his book actually contained classified information.  The Government does not deny -- as a general principle -- Snepp's right to publish unclassified information.  Nor does it contend -- at this stage of the litigation -- that Snepp's book contains classified material.  The Government simply claims that, in light of the special trust reposed in him and the agreement that he signed, Snepp should have given the CIA an opportunity to determine whether the material he proposed to publish would compromise classified information or sources.  Neither of the Government's concessions undercuts its claim that Snepp's failure to submit to prepublication review was a breach of his trust. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found that a former intelligence agent's publication of unreviewed material relating to intelligence activities can be detrimental   to vital national interests even if the published information is unclassified.  When a former agent relies on his own judgment about what information is detrimental, he may reveal information that the CIA -- with its broader understanding of what may expose classified information and confidential sources -- could have identified as harmful.  In addition to receiving intelligence from domestically based or controlled sources, the CIA obtains information from the intelligence services of friendly nations [ Footnote 7 ] and from agents operating in foreign countries.  The continued availability of these foreign sources depends upon the CIA's ability to guarantee the security of information that might compromise them and even endanger the personal safety of foreign agents. Undisputed evidence in this case shows that a CIA agent's violation of his obligation to submit writings about the Agency for prepublication review impairs the CIA's ability to perform its statutory duties.  Admiral Turner, Director of the CIA, testified without contradiction that Snepp's book and others like it have seriously impaired the effectiveness of American intelligence operations.  He said: ""Over the last six to nine months, we have had a number of sources discontinue work with us.  We have had more sources tell us that they are very nervous about continuing work with us.  We have had very strong complaints from a number of foreign intelligence services with whom we conduct liaison, who have questioned whether they should continue exchanging information with us, for fear it will not remain secret.  I cannot estimate   to you how many potential sources or liaison arrangements have never germinated because people were unwilling to enter into business with us."" 456 F. Supp.  at 179-180. [ Footnote 8 ]  In view of this and other evidence in the record, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals recognized that Snepp's breach of his explicit obligation to submit his material -- classified or not -- for prepublication clearance has irreparably harmed the United States Government.  595 F.2d  at 935; 456 F. Supp.  at 180. [ Footnote 9 ]  III The decision of the Court of Appeals denies the Government the most appropriate remedy for Snepp's acknowledged wrong.  Indeed, as a practical matter, the decision may well leave the Government with no reliable deterrent against similar breaches of security.  No one disputes that the actual damages attributable to a publication such as Snepp's generally are unquantifiable.  Nominal damages are a hollow alternative, certain to deter no one.  The punitive damages recoverable after a jury trial are speculative and unusual.  Even if recovered, they may bear no relation to either the Government's irreparable loss or Snepp's unjust gain. The Government could not pursue the only remedy that the Court of Appeals left it [ Footnote 10 ] without losing the benefit of the bargain it seeks to enforce.  Proof of the tortious conduct necessary to sustain an award of punitive damages might force the Government to disclose some of the very confidences that Snepp promised to protect.  The trial of such a suit, before a jury if the defendant so elects, would subject the CIA and its   officials to probing discovery into the Agency's highly confidential affairs.  Rarely would the Government run this risk.  In a letter introduced at Snepp's trial, former CIA Director Colby noted the analogous problem in criminal cases.  Existing law, he stated, ""requires the revelation in open court of confirming or additional information of such a nature that the potential damage to the national security precludes prosecution."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 78-1871, p. 68a.  When the Government cannot secure its remedy without unacceptable risks, it has no remedy at all. A constructive trust, on the other hand, protects both the Government and the former agent from unwarranted risks.  This remedy is the natural and customary consequence of a breach of trust. [ Footnote 11 ]  It deals fairly with both parties by conforming relief to the dimensions of the wrong.  If the agent secures prepublication clearance, he can publish with no fear of liability.  If the agent publishes unreviewed material in violation of his fiduciary and contractual obligation, the trust remedy simply requires him to disgorge the benefits of his faithlessness.  Since the remedy is swift and sure, it is tailored to deter those who would place sensitive information at risk.  And since the remedy reaches only funds attributable to the   breach, it cannot saddle the former agent with exemplary damages out of all proportion to his gain.  The decision of the Court of Appeals would deprive the Government of this equitable and effective means of protecting intelligence that may contribute to national security.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it refused to impose a constructive trust on Snepp's profits, and we remand the cases to the Court of Appeals for reinstatement of the full judgment of the District Court. So ordered. * Together with No. 79-265,  United States v. Snepp,  also on petition for certiorari to the same court. [ Footnote 1 ] Upon the eve of his departure from the Agency in 1976, Snepp also executed a ""termination secrecy agreement.""  That document reaffirmed his obligation ""never"" to reveal ""any classified information, or any information concerning intelligence or CIA that has not been made public by CIA . . . without the express written consent of the Director of Central Intelligence or his representative."" App. to Pct. for Cert. in No. 78-1871, p. 61a. [ Footnote 2 ] At the time of suit, Snepp already had received about $60,000 in advance payments.  His contract with his publisher provides for royalties and other potential profits.   456 F. Supp. 176 , 179 (ED Va.1978). [ Footnote 3 ] The Court of Appeals and the District Court rejected each of Snepp's defenses to the enforcement of his contract.  595 F.2d 926, 931-934 (CA4 1979); 456 F. Supp.  at 180-181.  In his petition for certiorari, Snepp relies primarily on the claim that his agreement is unenforceable as a prior restraint on protected speech. When Snepp accepted employment with the CIA, he voluntarily signed the agreement that expressly obligated him to submit any proposed publication for prior review.  He does not claim that he executed this agreement under duress.  Indeed, he voluntarily reaffirmed his obligation when he left the Agency.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that Snepp's agreement is an ""entirely appropriate"" exercise of the CIA Director's statutory mandate to ""protec[t] intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure,"" 50 U.S.C. § 403(d)(3).  595 F.2d  at 932.  Moreover, this Court's cases make clear that -- even in the absence of an express agreement -- the CIA could have acted to protect substantial government interests by imposing reasonable restrictions on employee activities that, in other contexts, might be protected by the First Amendment.   CSC v. Letter Carriers,   413 U. S. 548 ,   413 U. S. 565  (1973);  see Brown v. Glines, ante,  p.   444 U. S. 348 .   Buckley v Valeo,   424 U. S. 1 ,   424 U. S. 25 -28 (1976);  Greer v. Spock,   424 U. S. 828  (1976);  id.  at   424 U. S. 844 -848 (POWELL, J., concurring);  Cole v. Richardson,   405 U. S. 676  (1972).  The Government has a compelling interest in protecting both the secrecy of information important to our national security and the appearance of confidentiality so essential to the effective operation of our foreign intelligence service.   See infra  at   444 U. S. 511 -512.  The agreement that Snepp signed is a reasonable means for protecting this vital interest. [ Footnote 4 ] The Government's concession distinguished this litigation from  United States v. Marchetti,  466 F.2d 1309 (CA4),  cert. denied,  409 U.S. 1063 (1972).  There, the Government claimed that a former CIA employee intended to violate his agreement not to publish any classified information.  466 F.2d  at 1313.  Marchetti therefore did not consider the appropriate remedy for the breach of an agreement to submit all material for prepublication review.  By relying on  Marchetti  in this litigation, the Court of Appeals overlooked the difference between Snepp's breach and the violation at issue in  Marchetti. [ Footnote 5 ] The first sentence of the 1968 agreement read: ""I, Frank W. Snepp, III, understand that upon entering duty with the Central Intelligence Agency I am undertaking a position of trust in that Agency of the Government. . . ."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 78 1871, p. 58a. [ Footnote 6 ] Quite apart from the plain language of the agreement, the nature of Snepp's duties and his conceded access to confidential sources and materials could establish a trust relationship.   See  595 F.2d  at 939 (Hoffman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Few types of governmental employment involve a higher degree of trust than that reposed in a CIA employee with Snepp's duties. [ Footnote 7 ] Every major nation in the world has an intelligence service.  Whatever fairly may be said about some of its past activities, the CIA (or its predecessor the Office of Strategic Services) is an agency thought by every President since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be essential to the security of the United States and -- in a sense -- the free world.  It is impossible for a government wisely to make critical decisions about foreign policy and national defense without the benefit of dependable foreign intelligence.   See generally  T. Powers, The Man Who Kept the Secrets (1979). [ Footnote 8 ] In questioning the force of Admiral Turner's testimony, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' dissenting opinion suggests that the concern of foreign intelligence services may not be occasioned by the hazards of allowing an agent like Snepp to publish whatever he pleases, but by the release of classified information or simply the disagreement of foreign agencies with our Government's classification policy.   Post  at   444 U. S. 522 -523.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' views in this respect not only find no support in the record, but they also reflect a misapprehension of the concern reflected by Admiral Turner's testimony.  If in fact information is unclassified or in the public domain, neither the CIA nor foreign agencies would be concerned.  The problem is to ensure in advance, and by proper procedures, that information detrimental to national interest is not published.  Without a dependable prepublication review procedure, no intelligence agency or responsible Government official could be assured that an employee privy to sensitive information might not conclude on his own -- innocently or otherwise -- that it should be disclosed to the world. The dissent argues that the Court is allowing the CIA to ""censor"" its employees' publications.   Post  at   444 U. S. 522 .  Snepp's contract, however, requires no more than a clearance procedure subject to judicial review.  If Snepp, in compliance with his contract, had submitted his manuscript for review and the Agency had found it to contain sensitive material, presumably -- if one accepts Snepp's present assertion of good intentions -- an effort would have been made to eliminate harmful disclosures.  Absent agreement in this respect, the Agency would have borne the burden of seeking an injunction against publication.   See Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. v. Colby,  509 F.2d 1362 (CA4),  cert. denied,  421 U.S. 992 (1975);  United State v. Marchetti,  466 F.2d 1309 (CA4),  cert. denied,  409 U.S. 1063 (1972). [ Footnote 9 ] Although both the District Court and the Court of Appeals expressly found otherwise, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS says that ""the interest in confidentiality that Snepp's contract was designed to protect has not been compromised.""   Post  at   444 U. S. 516 -517.  Thus, on the basis of a premise wholly at odds with the record, the dissent bifurcates Snepp's 1968 agreement and treats its interdependent provisions as if they imposed unrelated obligations.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS then analogizes Snepp's prepublication review agreement with the Government to a private employee's covenant not to compete with his employer.   Post  at   444 U. S. 518 -520.  A body of private law intended to preserve competition, however, simply has no bearing on a contract made by the Director of the CIA in conformity with his statutory obligation to ""protec[t] intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.""  50 U.S.C. § 403(d)(3). [ Footnote 10 ] Judge Hoffman's dissent suggests that even this remedy may be unavailable if the Government must bring suit in a State that allows punitive damages only upon proof of compensatory damages.  595 F.2d  at 940.  The Court of Appeals majority, however, held as a matter of federal law that the nominal damages recoverable for any breach of a trust agreement will support an exemplary award.   See id.  at 936, and n. 10, 937-938. [ Footnote 11 ] See id.  at 939 (Hoffman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concedes that, even in the absence of a written contract, an employee has a fiduciary obligation to protect confidential information obtained during the course of his employment.   Post  at   444 U. S. 518 .  He also concedes that all personal profits gained from the exploitation of such information are impressed with a constructive trust in favor of the employer.   Post  at   444 U. S. 521 .  In this case, he seems to think that the common law would not treat information as ""confidential"" unless it were ""classified.""   See, e.g., post  at   444 U. S. 518 .  We have thought that the common law obligation was considerably more expansive.   See, e.g.,  Restatement (Second) of Agency §§ 396(c), 400 and Comment c, 404 and Comments b, d (1958); 5 A. Scott, Trusts § 505 (3d ed.1967).  But since this case involves the breach of a trust agreement that specifically required the prepublication review of all information about the employer, we need not look to the common law to determine the scope of Snepp's fiduciary obligation."

After petitioner denied respondent Citizens for a Better Environment (CBE) (a nonprofit environmental protection organization) a solicitation permit because it could not meet the ordinance's 75-percent requirement, CBE sued petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging that such requirement violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court granted summary judgment for CBE.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's argument that summary judgment was inappropriate because there was an unresolved factual dispute as to the true character of CBE's organization, and holding that, since CBE challenged the facial validity of the ordinance on First Amendment grounds, the facts as to CBE's internal affairs and operations were immaterial, and therefore not an obstacle to the granting of summary judgment.  The court concluded that, even if the 75-percent requirement might be valid as applied to other types of charitable solicitation, the requirement was unreasonable on its face because it barred solicitation by advocacy-oriented organizations even where the contributions would be used for reasonable salaries of those who gathered and disseminated information relevant to the organization's purpose. Held:   The ordinance in question is unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   444 U. S. 628 -639. (a) Charitable appeals for funds, on the street or door to door, involve a variety of speech interests -- communication of information, dissemination and propagation of views and ideas, and advocacy of causes -- that are within the First Amendment's protection.  While soliciting financial support is subject to reasonable regulation, such regulation must give due regard to the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and perhaps persuasive speech seeking support for particular causes or for particular views on economic,   political, or social issues, and to the reality that without solicitation the flow of such information and advocacy would likely cease.  Moreover, since charitable solicitation does more than inform private economic decisions and is not primarily concerned with providing information about the characteristics and costs of goods and services, it is not dealt with as a variety of purely commercial speech.  Pp.   444 U. S. 628 -632. (b) The Court of Appeals was free to inquire whether the ordinance was overbroad, a question of law that involved no dispute about CBE's characteristics, and thus properly proceeded to rule on the merits of the summary judgment. CBE was entitled to its judgment of facial invalidity if the ordinance purported to prohibit canvassing by a substantial category of charities to which the 75-percent limitation could not be applied consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, even if there was no demonstration that CBE itself was one of these organizations.  Pp.   444 U. S. 633 -635. (c) The 75-percent limitation is a direct and substantial limitation on protected activity that cannot be sustained unless it serves a sufficiently strong, subordinating interest that petitioner is entitled to protect.  Here, petitioner's proffered justifications that such limitation is intimately related to substantial governmental interests in preventing fraud and protecting public safety and residential privacy are inadequate, and such interests could be sufficiently served by measures less destructive of First Amendment interests.  Pp.   444 U. S. 635 -639. 590 F.2d 220, affirmed. WHITE, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN, STEWART, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

 FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Held:   A Texas public nuisance statute, construed as authorizing state judges, on the basis of a showing that a theater exhibited obscene films in the past, to enjoin its future exhibition of films not yet found to be obscene, is unconstitutional as authorizing an invalid prior restraint.   The statute cannot be considered to be valid on the asserted ground that it constitutes no greater a prior restraint than any criminal statute, since presumably an exhibitor would be subject to contempt proceedings for violating a preliminary restraining order under the statute even if the film is ultimately found to be nonobscene, whereas nonobscenity would be a defense to any criminal prosecution.  Nor is the statute saved merely because the temporary restraint is entered by a state trial judge, rather than an administrative censor.  That a judge might be thought more likely than an administrative censor to determine accurately that a work is obscene does not change the unconstitutional character of the restraint if erroneously entered.  Thus, the absence of any special safeguards governing the entry and review of orders restraining the exhibition of named or unnamed motion pictures, without regard to the context in which they are displayed, precludes the enforcement of the nuisance statute against motion picture exhibitors.   Cf. Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51 ;  Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad,   420 U. S. 546 . 587 F.2d 159, affirmed.  PER CURIAM. The question presented in this unusual obscenity case is whether the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit correctly held a Texas public nuisance statute unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals read the Texas statute as authorizing a prior restraint of indefinite duration on the exhibition of motion pictures without a final judicial determination of obscenity and without any guarantee of prompt review of a preliminary finding of probable obscenity.   Cf. Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51  (1965);  Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad,   420 U. S. 546  (1975).  In this Court, appellants argue that such a restraint is no more serious than that imposed by Texas' criminal statutes, and that it is therefore constitutional.  We find appellants' argument unpersuasive, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. In 1973, appellee King Arts Theatre, Inc. (hereafter appellee), operated an indoor, adults-only motion picture theater.  In October of that year, appellee's landlord gave notice that the theater's lease would be terminated.  The notice stated that the County Attorney had informed the landlord that he intended to obtain an injunction to abate the theater as a public nuisance in order to prevent the future showing of allegedly obscene motion pictures.  Appellee responded by filing suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking an injunction and declaratory relief to forestall any action by the County Attorney under the Texas nuisance statutes.  The case was transferred to a three-judge District Court sitting in the Southern District of Texas for consolidation with a number of other pending obscenity cases. Two different Texas statutes were in issue at that point.    The first, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann., Art. 4666 (Vernon 1952), [ Footnote 1 ] authorizes injunction suits in the name of the State against alleged nuisances.  If successful, ""judgment shall be rendered abating said nuisance and enjoining the defendants from maintaining the same, and ordering that said house be closed for one year,"" unless certain conditions are met.  The second nuisance statute, Art. 4667(a) (Vernon Supp. 1978), provides that certain habitual uses of premises shall constitute a public nuisance and shall be enjoined at the suit of either the State or any citizen.  Among the prohibited uses is ""the commercial manufacturing, commercial distribution, or commercial exhibition of obscene material."" [ Footnote 2 ]  The three-judge District Court held that both of these statutes authorize state judges, on the basis of a showing that obscene films have been exhibited in the past, to prohibit the future exhibition of motion pictures that have not yet been found to be obscene.   404 F. Supp. 33  (1975).  Recognizing that it is not unusual in nuisance litigation to prohibit future conduct on the basis of a finding of undesirable past or present conduct, the District Court read  Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson,   283 U. S. 697  (1931), to require a special analysis when the prohibited future conduct may be protected by the First Amendment. [ Footnote 3 ]  The routine abatement procedure, which the District Court characterized as ""the heavy hand of the public nuisance statute,"" was considered constitutionally deficient in the First Amendment context.  Specifically, the District Court noted that a general prohibition would operate as a prior restraint on unnamed motion pictures, and that even orders temporarily restraining the exhibition of specific films could be entered  ex parte.  [ Footnote 4 ]  Moreover, such a temporary restraining order could be extended by a temporary injunction based on a showing of probable success on the merits and without a final determination of obscenity. [ Footnote 5 ]  The District Court concluded that the nuisance statutes, when coupled with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure governing injunctions, operate as an invalid prior restraint on the exercise of First Amendment rights. Because the three-judge District Court granted only declaratory, and not injunctive, relief, the State appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.   See Gerstein v. Coe,   417 U. S. 279  (1974).  A divided panel of that court reversed.  559 F.2d 1286 (1977) . The panel   majority acknowledged that, if Art. 4666 authorized the closing of a motion picture theater for all uses for a year, it ""would pose serious first amendment questions,"" 559 F.2d  at 1290, but held that the District Court had misconstrued Art. 4666 in that it was not intended to apply to obscenity cases. [ Footnote 6 ] The panel majority disagreed more fundamentally with the District Court's view of Art. 4667(a).  It held that the injunction procedure authorized by that statute was ""basically sound"" in its application to an establishment such as appellee's: ""The statute authorizes an injunction against the commercial manufacture, distribution or exhibition of  obscene  material only.  Because the injunction follows, rather than precedes, a judicial determination that obscene material has been shown or distributed or manufactured on the premises, and because its prohibitions can apply only to further dealings with obscene and unprotected material, it does not constitute a prior restraint."" 559 F.2d  at 1292 (emphasis in original).  Further, the panel majority found no problem under  Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51  (1965), because any temporary restraint entered pending a final adjudication on the issue of obscenity would be imposed by a judge, not an administrative censor.  The judgment of the District Court was therefore reversed. [ Footnote 7 ]  The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc, and reversed the panel's holding that Art. 4667(a) is constitutional.  587 F.2d 159 (1978). [ Footnote 8 ]  The 8-to-6 majority found the statute objectionable because it ""would allow the issuance of an injunction against the future exhibition of unnamed films that depict particular acts enumerated in the state's obscenity statute,"" id.  at 168, and ""lacks the procedural safeguards required under  Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51 . . . .""   Id.  at 169. [ Footnote 9 ]  The dissenters wrote that a pragmatic assessment of the statute's operation indicated that, once the contemplated injunction was in effect, it would impose no greater a prior restraint than a criminal statute forbidding exhibition of materials deemed obscene under  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15  (1973). [ Footnote 10 ] The Texas defendants appealed to this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction.  442 U.S. 928.  We limit our review   to the two arguments advanced in appellants' brief: [ Footnote 11 ] first, that an ""obscenity injunction"" under Art. 4667(a)(3) constitutes no greater a prior restraint than any criminal statute and, second, that the Court of Appeals erroneously held that no prior restraint of possible First Amendment materials is permissible. I The Court of Appeals was quite correct in concluding both (a) that the regulation of a communicative activity such as the exhibition of motion pictures must adhere to more narrowly drawn procedures than is necessary for he abatement of an ordinary nuisance, [ Footnote 12 ] and (b) that the burden of supporting   an injunction against a future exhibition is even heavier than the burden of justifying the imposition of a criminal sanction for a past communication. [ Footnote 13 ] As the District Court and the Court of Appeals construed Art. 4667(a), when coupled with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, it authorizes prior restraints of indefinite duration on the exhibition of motion pictures that have not been finally adjudicated to be obscene. [ Footnote 14 ]  Presumably, an exhibitor would be required to obey such an order pending review of its merits and would be subject to contempt proceedings even if the film is ultimately found to be nonobscene. [ Footnote 15 ]  Such prior restraints would be more onerous and more objectionable than the threat of criminal sanctions after a film has been exhibited, since nonobscenity would be a defense to any criminal prosecution.  Nor does the fact that the temporary prior restraint is entered by a state trial judge, rather than an administrative censor, sufficiently distinguish this case from  Freedman v. Maryland.   "" Any  system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.""   Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,   372 U. S. 58 ,   372 U. S. 70  (1963) (emphasis added).  That a state trial judge might be thought more likely than an administrative censor to determine accurately that a work is obscene does not change the unconstitutional character of the restraint if erroneously entered. Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the absence of any special safeguards governing the entry and review of orders restraining the exhibition of named or unnamed motion pictures, without regard to the context in which they are displayed, precludes the enforcement of these nuisance statutes against motion picture exhibitors. Contrary to appellants' second argument, the Court of Appeals did not hold that there can never be a valid prior restraint on communicative activity.  The Court of Appeals simply held that these Texas statutes were procedurally deficient, and that they authorize prior restraints that are more onerous than is permissible under  Freedman v. Maryland  and  Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad,   420 U. S. 546  (1975). Because we find no merit in the contentions advanced on behalf of appellants, the judgment is affirmed. It is so ordered. [ Footnote 1 ] ""Art. 4666. Nuisance; prosecution"" ""Whenever the Attorney General or the district or county attorney has reliable information that such a nuisance exists, either of them shall file suit in the name of this State in the county where the nuisance is alleged to exist against whoever maintains such nuisance to abate and enjoin the same.  If judgment be in favor of the State, then judgment shall be rendered abating said nuisance and enjoining the defendants from maintaining the same, and ordering that said house be closed for one year from the date of said judgment, unless the defendants in said suit, or the owner, tenant or lessee of said property make bond payable to the State at the county seat of the county where such nuisance is alleged to exist, in the penal sum of not less than one thousand nor more than five thousand dollars, with sufficient sureties to be approved by the judge trying the case, conditioned that the acts prohibited in this law shall not be done or permitted to be done in said house.  On violation of any condition of such bond, the whole sum may be recovered as a penalty in the name and for the State in the county where such conditions are violated, all such suits to be brought by the district or county attorney of such county."" In the early stages of the litigation, the parties appear to have assumed that this statute applied to the exhibition of obscene motion pictures, at least the District Court so understood the statute.  The Court of Appeals, however, read Art. 4666 as applicable only to the types of nuisance specified in Art. 4664, none of which relates to obscenity.   See   n  6,  infra. [ Footnote 2 ] ""Art. 4667. Injunctions to abate public nuisances"" ""(a) The habitual use, actual, threatened or contemplated, of any premises, place or building or part thereof, for any of the following uses shall constitute a public nuisance and shall be enjoined at the suit of either the State or any citizen thereof:"" ""(1) For gambling, gambling promotion, or communicating gambling information prohibited by law;"" ""(2) For the promotion or aggravated promotion of prostitution, or compelling prostitution;"" ""(3) For the commercial manufacturing, commercial distribution, or commercial exhibition of obscene material;"" ""(4) For the commercial exhibition of live dances or exhibition which depicts real or simulated sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse;"" ""(5) For the voluntary engaging in a fight between a man and a bull for money or other thing of value, or for any championship, or upon result of which any money or anything of value is bet or wagered, or to see which any admission fee is charged either directly or indirectly, as prohibited by law."" [ Footnote 3 ] ""In its defense, the state has tried to distinguish the instant case from  Near v. Minnesota, supra,  but the attempt is not successful.  In both cases, the state made the mistake of prohibiting future conduct after a finding of undesirable present conduct.  When that future conduct may be protected by the first amendment, the whole system must fail, because the dividing line between protected and unprotected speech may be 'dim and uncertain.'   Bantam Books v. Sullivan ,  372 U.S. [58,   372 U. S. 66  (1963)].  The separation of these forms of speech calls for 'sensitive tools,'  Speiser v. Randall,   357 U. S. 513  . . . (1958), not the heavy hand of the public nuisance statute."" 404 F. Supp.  at 44. [ Footnote 4 ] In dissent, MR. JUSTICE WHITE incorrectly assumes that it is ""undisputed that any injunction granted under Art. 4667(a) will be phrased in terms of the  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15  (1973), definition of obscenity."" Post  at   445 U. S. 321 .  This is by no means necessarily so.  Under the Texas statutes, a temporary injunction prohibiting the exhibition of specific named films could be entered on the basis of a showing of probability of success on the merits of the obscenity issue.  Even if it were ultimately determined that the film is not obscene, the exhibitor could be punished for contempt of court for showing the film before the obscenity issue was finally resolved. [ Footnote 5 ] ""The specific requirements of obtaining an injunction in Texas, which would presumably be utilized in actions pursuant to article 4667, leave much to be desired if they are used in the obscenity context.  Rules 680-693a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provide the injunction procedures for Texas.  Pursuant to those rules, the state could obtain a temporary restraining order, lasting up to ten days,  ex parte.   As soon as possible within that ten days, however, a hearing on a temporary injunction is obtainable.  The temporary injunction is not a final adjudication on the merits, but, once it is obtained, there is no provision for treating the case any differently from any other civil case.  The lack of a provision for a swift final adjudication on the obscenity question raises serious doubts of the constitutional usability of the injunction process in Texas for an obscenity situation."" 404 F. Supp.  at 46. [ Footnote 6 ] The panel interpreted the ""such a nuisance"" language in the first sentence of Art. 4666,  see   n  1,  supra,  as referring to the definition of ""common nuisance[s]"" in Art. 4664 (Vernon Supp. 1978):  gambling houses, houses of prostitution, and places where intoxicating liquors are kept. [ Footnote 7 ] Judge Thornberry, dissenting in part, relied on the reasoning of the three-judge District Court: ""As the district court wrote:"" ""   Pursuant to [Rules 68693a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure], the state could obtain a temporary restraining order lasting up to ten days,  ex parte.   As soon as possible within that ten days, however, a hearing on a temporary injunction is obtainable.  The temporary injunction is not a final adjudication on the merits but, once it is obtained, there is no provision for treating the [obscenity] case any differently from any other civil case.  The lack of a provision for a swift final adjudication on the obscenity question raises serious doubts of the constitutional usability of the injunction process in Texas for an obscenity situation."" 559 F.2d  at 1303. [ Footnote 8 ] It accepted the panel majority's construction of Art. 4666,  i.e.,  that it was inapplicable in obscenity cases. [ Footnote 9 ] In  Freedman,  the Court gave three reasons for holding Maryland's censorship procedures unconstitutional: ""It is readily apparent that the Maryland procedural scheme does not satisfy these criteria.  First, once the censor disapproves the film, the exhibitor must assume the burden of instituting judicial proceedings and of persuading the courts that the film is protected expression.  Second, once the Board has acted against a film, exhibition is prohibited pending judicial review, however protracted.  Under the statute, appellant could have been convicted if he had shown the film after unsuccessfully seeking a license, even though no court had ever ruled on the obscenity of the film.  Third, it is abundantly clear that the Maryland statute provides no assurance of prompt judicial determination."" 380 U.S. at   380 U. S. 59 -60. [ Footnote 10 ] The dissenters also relied on the panel majority's distinction between a temporary restraint entered by a judge and one entered by an administrative censor. [ Footnote 11 ] The brief is confined to an attack on the Court of Appeals' holding that Art. 4667(a) is unconstitutional as applied to allegedly obscene material.  At oral argument, appellants' counsel invited us also to review issues relating to Art. 4666 and the question whether the District Curt should have abstained.  Since the former contention would require us to review a construction of Art. 4666 which all members of the en banc Court of Appeals ultimately accepted, and since the latter contention was not raised in the Court of Appeals, we decline the invitation. [ Footnote 12 ] Emphasizing the difference between a regulation touching freedom of expression and the regulation of ordinary commercial activity, in  Freedman v. Maryland,  the Court wrote: ""In the area of freedom of expression, it is well established that one has standing to challenge a statute on the ground that it delegates overly broad licensing discretion to an administrative office, whether or not his conduct could be proscribed by a properly drawn statute, and whether or not he applied for a license."" ""One who might have had a license for the asking may . . . call into question the whole scheme of licensing when he is prosecuted for failure to procure it."" "" Thornhill v. Alabama,   310 U. S. 88 ,   310 U. S. 97 ;  see Staub v. City of Baxley,   355 U. S. 313 ,   355 U. S. 319 ;  Saia v. New York,   334 U. S. 558 ;  Thomas v. Collins,   323 U. S. 516 ;  Hague v. CIO,   307 U.

[ Footnote 13 ] ""Any system of prior restraint, however, 'comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.'   Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,  372 U.S. at   372 U. S. 70 ;  New York Times Co. v. United States ,  403 U.S. [713,   403 U. S. 714  (1971)];  Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe,   402 U. S. 415 ,   402 U.

The presumption against prior restraints is heavier -- and the degree of protection broader -- than that against limits on expression imposed by criminal penalties.  Behind the distinction is a theory deeply etched in our law:  a free society prefers to punish the few who abuse rights of speech after they break the law than to throttle them and all others beforehand.  It is always difficult to know in advance what an individual will say, and the line between legitimate and illegitimate speech is often so finely drawn that the risks of freewheeling censorship are formidable.

 FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondents, both Republicans, brought suit in Federal District Court to enjoin petitioner, a Democrat, who had recently been appointed Public Defender of Rockland County, N.Y. by the Democrat-dominated county legislature, from discharging respondents from their positions as Assistant Public Defenders.  Finding that respondents had been satisfactorily performing their jobs and had been selected for termination solely because they were Republicans, and that an assistant public defender is neither a policymaker nor a confidential employee, the District Court held that petitioner could not terminate respondents' employment consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and granted injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   The First and Fourteenth Amendments protect respondents from discharge solely because of their political beliefs.  Pp.   445 U. S. 513 -520. (a) To prevail in this type of action, there is no requirement that dismissed government employees prove that they, or other employees, have been coerced into changing, either actually or ostensibly, their political allegiance.  Rather, it was sufficient for respondents here to prove that they were about to be discharged ""solely for the reason that they were not affiliated with or sponsored by the Democratic Party.""   Elrod v. Burns,   427 U. S. 347 ,   427 U. S. 350 .  Pp.   445 U. S. 513 -517. (b) The issue is not whether the label ""policymaker"" or ""confidential"" fits the particular public office in question, but rather whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the office.  Here, it is manifest that the continued employment of an assistant public defender cannot properly be conditioned upon his allegiance to the political party in control of the county government.  The primary, if not the only, responsibility of an assistant public defender is to represent individual citizens in controversy with the State.  Whatever policymaking occurs in his office must relate to individual clients' needs, and not to any partisan political interests.  Similarly, although an assistant is bound to obtain access to confidential information arising out of various attorney-client relationships, that information has no bearing on partisan political concerns.  Under these circumstances,   it would undermine, rather than promote, the effective performance of an assistant public defender's office to make his tenure dependent on his allegiance to the dominant political party.

 FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   An Illinois statute generally prohibits picketing of residences or dwellings, but exempts from its prohibition peaceful picketing of a place of employment involved in a labor dispute.  Appellees were convicted in state court of violating this statute when they picketed the Mayor of Chicago's home in protest against his alleged failure to support the busing of schoolchildren to achieve racial integration.  Thereafter, appellees brought suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, and an injunction prohibiting appellant and other state and local officials from enforcing the statute.  The District Court denied all relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statute, both on its face and as applied to appellees, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Held:   The Illinois statute is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since it makes an impermissible distinction between peaceful labor picketing and other peaceful picketing.   Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley,   408 U. S. 92 .  Pp.   447 U. S. 459 -471. (a) In prohibiting peaceful picketing on the public streets and sidewalks in residential neighborhoods, the statute regulates expressive conduct that falls within the First Amendment's preserve, and, in exempting peaceful labor picketing from its general prohibition, the statute discriminates between lawful and unlawful conduct based upon the content of the demonstrator's communication.  On its face, the statute accords preferential treatment to the expression of views on one particular subject; information about labor disputes may be freely disseminated but discussion of all other issues is restricted.  The permissibility of residential picketing is thus dependent solely on the nature of the message being conveyed.  Pp.   447 U. S. 459 -463. (b) Standing alone, the State's asserted interest in promoting the privacy of the home is not sufficient to save the statute.  The statute makes no attempt to distinguish among various sorts of nonlabor picketing on the basis of the harms they would inflict on the privacy interest.  More fundamentally, the exclusion of labor picketing cannot be upheld as a means of protecting residential privacy for the simple reason that   nothing in the content-based labor-nonlabor distinction has any bearing on privacy.  Pp.   447 U. S. 464 -465. (c) Similarly, the State's interest in providing special protection for labor protests cannot, without more, justify the labor picketing exemption.  Labor picketing is no more deserving of First Amendment protection than are public protests over other issues, particularly the important economic, social, and political subjects about which appellees wished to demonstrate.  Pp.   447 U. S. 466 -467. (d) Nor can the statute be justified as an attempt to accommodate the competing rights of the homeowner to enjoy his privacy and the employee to demonstrate over labor disputes, since such an attempt hinges on the validity of both of these goals, the latter of which -- the desire to favor one form of speech over all others -- is illegitimate.  Likewise, the statute cannot be justified as an attempt to prohibit picketing that would impinge on residential privacy while permitting picketing that would not.  Numerous types of peaceful picketing other than labor picketing would have but a negligible impact on privacy interests, and numerous other actions of a homeowner might constitute ""nonresidential"" uses of his property, and would thus serve to vitiate the right to residential privacy.  Pp.   447 U. S. 467 -469. (e) While the State's interest in protecting the wellbeing, tranquility, and privacy of the home is of the highest order, the crucial question is whether the statute advances that objective in a manner consistent with the Equal Protection Clause.  Because the statute discriminates among pickets based on the subject matter of their expression, the answer to that question must be ""No.""  Pp.   447 U. S. 470 -471. 602 F.2d 791, affirmed.

 Syllabus   Held:   An order of appellee New York Public Service Commission that prohibits the inclusion by appellant (and other public utility companies) in monthly bills of inserts discussing controversial issues of public policy directly infringes the freedom of speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and thus is invalid.   Cf. First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,   435 U. S. 765 .  Pp.   447 U. S. 533 -544. (a) The restriction on bill inserts cannot be upheld on the ground that appellant, as a corporation, is not entitled to freedom of speech. ""The inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual."" First National Bank of Boston v Bellotti, supra  at   435 U. S. 777 .  Pp.   447 U. S. 533 -535. (b) Nor is the state action here a valid time, place, or manner restriction.  While the validity of reasonable time, place, or manner regulations that serve a significant governmental interest and leave ample alternative channels for communication has been recognized, such regulations may not be based upon either the content or subject matter of speech.  Appellee here does not pretend that its action is unrelated to the content of bill inserts, inserts that present information to consumers on certain subjects, such as energy conservation measures, being allowed, but inserts that discuss public controversies being forbidden.  Pp.   447 U.S. 535 -537. (c) The prohibition against inserts is not a permissible subject matter regulation merely because it applies to all discussion of political controversies, whether pro or con.  The First Amendment's hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic, and the regulation at issue here does not fall within the narrow exceptions to the general prohibition against subject matter distinctions.   Greer v. Spock,   424 U. S. 828 , and  Lehman v. Shaker Heights,   418 U. S. 298 , distinguished.  Pp.   447 U. S. 537 -540. (d) Furthermore, the state action here is not valid as a narrowly drawn prohibition serving a compelling state interest.  The prohibition   cannot be justified as being necessary to avoid forcing appellant's views on a captive audience, since customers may escape exposure to objectionable material simply by throwing the bill insert into a wastebasket.  Nor is the prohibition warranted as being necessary to allocate, in the public interest, the limited space in the billing envelope, there being nothing in the record to show that the bill inserts at issue would preclude the inclusion of other inserts that appellant might be ordered lawfully to include in the billing envelope.   Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC,   395 U. S. 367 , distinguished.  And the prohibition cannot be justified as being necessary to ensure that ratepayers do not subsidize the cost of the bill inserts, since there is no basis on the record to assume that appellee could not exclude the cost of the inserts from the utility's rate base.

 Syllabus   Held:   A regulation of appellee New York Public Service Commission which completely bans an electric utility from advertising to promote the use of electricity violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   447 U. S. 561 -572. (a) Although the Constitution accords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression, nevertheless the First Amendment protects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation.  For commercial speech to come within the First Amendment, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.  Next, it must be determined whether the asserted governmental interest to be served by the restriction on commercial speech is substantial.  If both inquiries yield positive answers, it must then be decided whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.  Pp.   447 U. S. 561 -566. (b) In this case, it is not claimed that the expression at issue is either inaccurate or relates to unlawful activity.  Nor is appellant electrical utility's promotional advertising unprotected commercial speech merely because appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area.  Since monopoly over the supply of a product provides no protection from competition with substitutes for that product, advertising by utilities is just as valuable to consumers as advertising by unregulated firms, and there is no indication that appellant's decision to advertise was not based on the belief that consumers were interested in the advertising.  Pp.   447 U. S. 566 -568. (c) The State's interest in energy conservation is clearly substantial, and is directly advanced by appellee's regulations.  The State's further interest in preventing inequities in appellant's rates -- based on the assertion that successful promotion of consumption in ""off-peak"" periods would create extra costs that would, because of appellant's rate structure, be borne by all consumers through higher overall rates -- is also substantial.  The latter interest does not, however, provide a constitutionally adequate reason for restricting protected speech because the link between the advertising prohibition and appellant's rate structure is, at most, tenuous.  Pp.   447 U. S. 568 -569.  (d) Appellee's regulation, which reaches all promotional advertising, regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use, is more extensive than necessary to further the State's interest in energy conservation which, as important as it is, cannot justify suppressing information about electric devices or services that would cause no net increase in total energy use.  In addition, no showing has been made that a more limited restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not serve adequately the State's interests.  Pp.   447 U.

 Syllabus   At the commencement of a fourth trial on a murder charge (the defendant's conviction after the first trial having been reversed on appeal, and two subsequent retrials having ended in mistrials), the Virginia trial court granted defense counsel's motion that the trial be closed to the public without any objections having been made by the prosecutor or by appellants, a newspaper and two of its reporters who were present in the courtroom, defense counsel having stated that he did not ""want any information being shuffled back and forth when we have a recess as to . . . who testified to what.""  Later that same day, however, the trial judge granted appellants' request for a hearing on a motion to vacate the closure order, and appellants' counsel contended that constitutional considerations mandated that, before ordering closure, the court should first decide that the defendant's rights could be protected in no other way.  But the trial judge denied the motion, saying that, if he felt that the defendant's rights were infringed in any way and others' rights were not overridden, he was inclined to order closure, and ordered the trial to continue ""with the press and public excluded.""  The next day, the court granted defendant's motion to strike the prosecution's evidence, excused the jury, and found the defendant not guilty.  Thereafter, the court granted appellants' motion to intervene  nunc pro tunc  in the case, and the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed their mandamus and prohibition petitions and, finding no reversible error, denied their petition for appeal from the closure order.

 APPELLATE DIVISION
 Syllabus   Appellants operate an adult bookstore in the commercial zone of appellee borough, and the store contains licensed coin-operated devices that display adult films.  When appellants added a coin-operated mechanism permitting a customer to watch a usually nude live dancer, complaints were filed against them charging that the exhibition of live dancing violated an ordinance that restricted uses permitted in a commercial zone, and they were convicted.  Rejecting appellants' defense based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the trial court, while recognizing that live nude dancing is protected by the First Amendment, held that First Amendment guarantees were not involved, since the case involved solely a zoning ordinance under which live entertainment, whether a nude dance or some other form of live presentation, was not a permitted use in any establishment in the borough.  The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed, and the New Jersey Supreme Court denied further review. Held:   Appellants' convictions are invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, for appellee failed to justify the exclusion of live entertainment from the broad range of commercial uses permitted in the borough.  Pp.   452 U. S. 65 -77. (a) The ordinance in question, as construed by the New Jersey courts to exclude live entertainment, including nude dancing, throughout the borough, prohibits a wide range of expression that has long been held to be within the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  An entertainment program may not be prohibited solely because it displays a nude human figure, and nude dancing is not without its First Amendment protection from official regulation.  Pp.   452 U. S. 65 -66. (b) The First Amendment requires sufficient justification for the exclusion of a broad category of protected expression from the permitted commercial uses, and none of appellee's asserted justifications withstands scrutiny.  Its asserted justification that permitting live entertainment would conflict with its plan to create a commercial area catering only to the residents' ""immediate needs"" is patently insufficient.  As to its asserted justification that live entertainment may be selectively excluded from the permitted commercial uses to avoid problems associated with live entertainment, such as parking, trash, police protection,   and medical facilities, appellee has presented no evidence that live entertainment poses problems of this nature more significant than those associated with various permitted uses, or that its interests could not be met by restrictions that are less intrusive on protected forms of expression.  And as to the claimed justification that the ordinance in question is a reasonable ""time, place, and manner"" restriction, appellee does not identify its interests making it reasonable to exclude all live entertainment but to allow a variety of other commercial uses, and has presented no evidence that live entertainment is incompatible with the permitted uses.

 Syllabus   A rule (Rule 6.05) of the Minnesota Agricultural Society (Society), a Minnesota public corporation that operates the annual state fair, provides that sale or distribution of any merchandise, including printed or written material, except from a duly licensed location on the fairgrounds shall be a misdemeanor.  As Rule 6.05 is construed and applied by the Society, all persons, groups, or firms desiring to sell, exhibit, or distribute materials during the fair must do so only from fixed locations.  However, the Rule does not prevent organizational representatives from walking about the fairgrounds and communicating the organization's views to fair patrons in face-to-face discussions.  Space in the fairgrounds is rented in a nondiscriminatory fashion on a first-come, first-served basis, and Rule 6.05 applies alike to nonprofit, charitable, and commercial enterprises.  Respondents, International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. (ISKCON), an organization espousing the views of the Krishna religion, and the head of one of its temples filed suit in a Minnesota state court against state officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that Rule 6.05, on its face and as applied, violated their First Amendment rights.  ISKCON asserted that the Rule suppressed the practice of Sankirtan, a religious ritual that enjoins its members to go into public places to distribute or sell religious literature and to solicit donations for the support of the Krishna religion.  The trial court upheld the constitutionality of Rule 6.05, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed. Held:   Rule 6.05, requiring members of ISKCON who desire to practice Sankirtan at the state fair to confine their distribution, sales, and solicitation activities to a fixed location, is a permissible restriction on the place and manner of communicating the views of the Krishna religion.  Pp.   452 U. S. 647 -655. (a) Rule 6.05 is not based upon the content or subject matter of speech, since it applies evenhandedly to all persons or organizations,   whether commercial or charitable, who wish to distribute and sell written materials or to solicit funds.  Nor is the Rule which involves a method of allocating space on a first-come, first-served basis -- open to the kind of arbitrary application that is inherently inconsistent with a valid time, place, and manner regulation as having the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.  Pp.   452 U. S. 648 -649. (b) The State's interest in maintaining the orderly movement of the crowd at the fair is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that a time, place, or manner restriction must serve a significant governmental interest.  The significance of that interest must be assessed in light of the characteristic nature and function of the particular forum involved.  Because the fairgrounds comprise a relatively small area where an enormous variety of goods, services, entertainment, and other matters of interest are exhibited to large crowds on a temporary basis, the State's interest in the orderly movement and control of such an assembly is a substantial consideration.  Pp.   452 U. S. 649 -651. (c) The justification for Rule 6.05 cannot be measured solely on the basis of the disorder that would result from granting members of ISKCON an exemption from the Rule.  Inclusion of peripatetic solicitation as part of a church ritual does not entitle church members to solicitation rights in a public forum superior to those of members of other religious groups that raise money but do not purport to ritualize the process.  And if Rule 6.05 is an invalid restriction on ISKCON's activities, it is no more valid with respect to other social, political, or charitable organizations seeking to distribute information, sell wares, or solicit funds at the fair.  Pp.   452 U. S. 651 -654. (d) Similarly, Rule 6.05 cannot be viewed as an unnecessary regulation on the ground that the State could avoid the threat to its interest posed by ISKCON by less restrictive means, such as penalizing disorder, limiting the number of solicitors, or imposing more narrowly drawn restrictions on the location and movement of ISKCON's representatives.  Since the inquiry must involve all other organizations that would be entitled to distribute, sell, or solicit if the booth rule may not be enforced with respect to ISKCON, it is improbable that such alternative means would deal adequately with the problems posed by the large number of distributors and solicitors that would be present on the fairgrounds.  P.   452 U. S. 654 . (e) Alternative forums for the expression of respondents' protected speech exist despite the effects of Rule 6.05.  The Rule does not prevent ISKCON from practicing Sankirtan anywhere outside the fairgrounds, nor does it exclude ISKCON from the fairgrounds.  Its members may mingle with the crowd and orally propagate their views, and ISKCON   may also arrange for a booth and distribute and sell literature and solicit funds from that location on the fairgrounds.

 THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 Syllabus   Title 18 U.S.C. § 1725 prohibits the deposit of unstamped ""mailable matter"" in a letterbox approved by the United States Postal Service, and violations are subject to a fine.  The local Postmaster notified appellee civic association that its practice of delivering messages to residents by placing unstamped notices in the letterboxes of private homes violated § 1725, and advised it that, if it and other members of appellee council of civic associations continued such practice, it could result in a fine.  Appellees then brought suit in Federal District Court against the Postal Service for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the enforcement of § 1725 would inhibit their communications with local residents and would thereby deny them the freedom of speech and press secured by the First Amendment.  The District Court ultimately declared § 1725 unconstitutional as applied to appellees and the council's member associations and enjoined the Postal Service from enforcing it as to them. Held:   Section 1725 does not unconstitutionally abridge appellees' First Amendment rights, inasmuch as neither the enactment nor the enforcement of § 1725 is geared in any way to the content of the message sought to be placed in the letterbox.  Pp.   453 U. S. 120 -134. (a) When a letterbox is designated an ""authorized depository"" of the mail by the Postal Service, it becomes an essential part of the nationwide system for the delivery and receipt of mail.  In effect, the postal customer, although he pays for the physical components of the ""authorized depository,"" agrees to abide by the Postal Service's regulations in exchange for the Postal Service agreeing to deliver and pick up his mail.  A letterbox, once designated an ""authorized depository,"" does not at the same time transform itself into a ""public forum"" of some limited nature to which the First Amendment guarantees access to all comers.  Just because it may be somewhat more efficient for appellees to place their messages in letterboxes does not mean that there is a First Amendment right to do so.  The First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the Government.  Pp.   453 U. S. 126 -131.  (b) Congress, in exercising its constitutional authority to develop and operate a national postal system, may properly legislate with the generality of cases in mind, and should not be put to the test of defending in one township after another the constitutionality of a statute under the traditional ""time, place, and manner"" analysis.  If Congress and the Postal Service are to operate as efficiently as possible an extensive system for the delivery of mail, they must adopt regulations of a general character having uniform applicability throughout the Nation.  In this case, Congress was legislating to promote what it considered to be the efficiency of the Postal Service, and was not laying down a generalized prohibition against the distribution of leaflets or the discussion of issues in traditional public forums.  Pp.   453 U. S. 133 -133. (c) While Congress may not, by its own  ipse dixit,  destroy the ""public forum"" status of streets and parks, a letterbox may not properly be analogized to streets and parks.  Pp.   453 U.

 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   One provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (Act), 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C), prohibits individuals and unincorporated associations from contributing more than $5,000 per calendar year to any multicandidate political committee.  A related provision, § 441a(f), makes it unlawful for political committees knowingly to accept contributions exceeding the $5,000 limit.  Appellant California Medical Association (CMA) is a not-for-profit unincorporated association of doctors, and appellant California Medical Political Action Committee (CALPAC) is a political committee formed by CMA and registered with appellee Federal Election Commission (FEC).  When CMA and CALPAC were notified of an impending enforcement proceeding by the FEC for alleged violations of §§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(f), they, together with individual members, filed a declaratory judgment action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of these provisions.  Subsequently, the FEC filed its enforcement proceeding in the same District Court, and CMA and CALPAC pleaded as affirmative defenses the same constitutional claims raised in their declaratory judgment action.  Pursuant to the special expedited review provisions of the Act, § 437h(a), the District Court, while the enforcement proceeding was still pending, certified the constitutional questions raised in the declaratory judgment action to the Court of Appeals, which rejected the constitutional claims and upheld the challenged $5,000 limit on annual contributions.  Appellants sought review on direct appeal in this Court pursuant to § 437h(b). Held:   The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.   453 U. S. 187 -201;   453 U. S. 201 -204. 641 F.2d 619, affirmed."

 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent, an American citizen and a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, announced a campaign ""to expose CIA officers and agents and to take the measures necessary to drive them out of the countries where they are operating.""  He then engaged in activities abroad that have resulted in identifications of alleged undercover CIA agents and intelligence sources in foreign countries.  Because of these activities the Secretary of State revoked respondent's passport, explaining that the revocation was based on a regulation authorizing revocation of a passport where the Secretary determines that an American citizen's activities abroad ""are causing or are likely to cause serious damage to the national security or the foreign policy of the United States.""  The notice also advised respondent of his right to an administrative hearing.  Respondent filed suit against the Secretary in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that the regulation invoked by the Secretary has not been authorized by Congress and is impermissibly overbroad; that the passport revocation violated respondent's freedom to travel and his First Amendment right to criticize Government policies; and that the failure to accord him a pre-revocation hearing violated his Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process.  Granting summary judgment for respondent and ordering the Secretary to restore respondent's passport, the District Court held that the regulation exceeded the Secretary's power under the Passport Act of 1926, which authorizes the Secretary to ""grant and issue passports, and cause passports to be granted, issued, and verified in foreign countries by diplomatic representatives of the United States . . . under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe. . . ."" The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Secretary was required to show that Congress had authorized the regulation either by an express delegation or by implied approval of a ""substantial and consistent"" administrative practice, and that no such authority had been shown. Held:   The 1926 Act authorizes the revocation of respondent's passport pursuant to the policy announced by the challenged regulation, such   policy being ""sufficiently substantial and consistent"" to compel the conclusion that Congress has approved it; and the regulation is constitutional as applied.  Pp.   453 U. S. 289 -310. (a) Although the Act does not, in express terms, authorize the Secretary to revoke a passport or deny a passport application, neither does it expressly limit those powers.  It is beyond dispute that he has the power to deny a passport for reasons not specified in the statutes, and, as respondent concedes, if the Secretary may deny a passport application for a certain reason, he may revoke a passport on the same ground.  Pp.   453 U. S. 289 -291. (b) In light of the broad rulemaking authority granted in the Act, the consistent administrative construction of it must be followed by the courts, absent compelling indications that such construction is wrong.  This is especially so in light of the fact that the statute deals with foreign policy and national security, where congressional silence is not to be equated with disapproval.  Pp.   453 U. S. 291 -292. (c) Absent evidence of any legislative intent to repudiate the consistent administrative construction of the prior and similar 1856 Passport Act as preserving the nonstatutory authority of the President and Secretary to withhold passports on national security and foreign policy grounds, it must be concluded that Congress, in enacting the 1926 Act, adopted such construction.  Moreover, the Executive has consistently construed the 1926 Act to work no change in prior practice.  Pp.   453 U. S. 292 -300. (d) A 1978 statute making it unlawful to travel abroad without a passport even in peacetime and a 1978 amendment to the 1926 Act providing that ""[u]nless authorized by law,"" in the absence of war, armed hostilities, or imminent danger to travelers, a passport may not be geographically restricted, are weighty evidence of congressional approval of the Secretary's interpretation of his authority to revoke passports, particularly as set forth in the challenged regulation.  Pp.   453 U. S. 300 -301. (e) An administrative policy or practice may be consistent even though the occasions for invoking it are limited.  Although a pattern of actual enforcement is one indicator of Executive policy, it suffices that the Executive has openly asserted the power at issue.   Kent v. Dulles,   357 U. S. 116 , distinguished.  Pp.   453 U. S. 301 -303. (f) The protection accorded beliefs, standing alone, is very different from the protection accorded conduct.  Here, beliefs and speech are only part of respondent's campaign, which presents a serious danger to American officials abroad and to the national security.  Pp.   453 U. S. 304 -306. (g) In light of the express language in the challenged regulation,   which permits revocation of a passport only in cases involving likelihood of ""serious damage"" to national security or foreign policy, respondent's constitutional claims are without merit.  The right to hold a passport is subordinate to national security and foreign policy considerations, and is subject to reasonable governmental regulation.  Assuming,  arguendo,  that First Amendment protections reach beyond our national boundaries, respondent's First Amendment claim is without foundation.  See Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson,   283 U. S. 697 ,   283 U. S. 716 . To the extent the revocation of respondent's passport operates to inhibit him, it is an inhibition of action, rather than of speech.  And, on the record of this case, the Government is not required to hold a pre-revocation hearing, since where there is a substantial likelihood of ""serious damage"" to national security or foreign policy as the result of a passport holder's activities abroad, the Government may take action to ensure that the holder may not exploit the United States' sponsorship of his travels.  The Constitution's due process guarantees call for no more than what was accorded here:  a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a prompt post-revocation hearing.  Pp.   453 U.

 Syllabus   Appellee city of San Diego enacted an ordinance which imposes substantial prohibitions on the erection of outdoor advertising displays within the city.  The stated purpose of the ordinance is ""to eliminate hazards to pedestrians and motorists brought about by distracting sign displays"" and ""to preserve and improve the appearance of the City.""  The ordinance permits on-site commercial advertising (a sign advertising goods or services available on the property where the sign is located), but forbids other commercial advertising and noncommercial advertising using fixed-structure signs, unless permitted by 1 of the ordinance's 12 specified exceptions, such as temporary political campaign signs.  Appellants, companies that were engaged in the outdoor advertising business in the city when the ordinance was passed, brought suit in state court to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance.  The trial court held that the ordinance was an unconstitutional exercise of the city's police power and an abridgment of appellants' First Amendment rights.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed on the first ground alone, but the California Supreme Court reversed, holding,  inter alia,  that the ordinance was not facially invalid under the First Amendment.

 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The University of Missouri at Kansas City, a state university, makes its facilities generally available for the activities of registered student groups.  A registered student religious group that had previously received permission to conduct its meetings in University facilities was informed that it could no longer do so because of a University regulation prohibiting the use of University buildings or grounds ""for purposes of religious worship or religious teaching.""  Members of the group then brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the regulation violated,  inter alia,  their rights to free exercise of religion and freedom of speech under the First Amendment.  The District Court upheld the regulation as being not only justified, but required, by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, viewing the regulation as a content-based discrimination against religious speech, for which it could find no compelling justification, and holding that the Establishment Clause does not bar a policy of equal access, in which facilities are open to groups and speakers of all kinds. Held:   The University's exclusionary policy violates the fundamental principle that a state regulation of speech should be content-neutral.  Pp.   454 U. S. 267 -277. (a) Having created a forum generally open for use by student groups, the University, in order to justify discriminatory exclusion from such forum based on the religious content of a group's intended speech, must satisfy the standard of review appropriate to content-based exclusions;  i.e.,  it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.  Pp.   454 U. S. 267 -270. (b) Although the University's interest in complying with its constitutional obligations under the Establishment Clause may be characterized as compelling, an ""equal access"" policy would not be incompatible with that Clause.  A policy will not offend the Establishment Clause if it can pass the following three-pronged test:  (1) It has a secular legislative purpose; (2) its principal or primary effect would be neither to advance nor to inhibit religion; and (3) it does not foster ""an excessive government entanglement with religion.""  Here, it is conceded that an ""equal access""   policy would meet the first and third prongs of the test.  In the context of this case and in the absence of any evidence that religious groups will dominate the University's forum, the advancement of religion would not be the forum's ""primary effect.""  An ""equal access"" policy would therefore satisfy the test's second prong as well.  Pp.   454 U. S. 270 -275. (c) The State's interest in achieving greater separation of church and State than is already ensured under the Establishment Clause is not sufficiently ""compelling"" to justify content-based discrimination against religious speech of the student group in question.

 Syllabus   A Berkeley, Cal., ordinance places a limitation of $250 on contributions to committees formed to support or oppose ballot measures submitted to a popular vote.  When appellant association, which was formed to oppose a ballot measure imposing rent control in the city, accepted some contributions exceeding the $250 limit, appellee Berkeley Fair Campaign Practices Commission ordered the association to pay the excess into the city treasury.  The association then brought suit in California Superior Court seeking injunctive relief against enforcement of the ordinance, and that court subsequently granted summary judgment for the association, holding that the ordinance was invalid on its face as a violation of the First Amendment.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, but the California Supreme Court reversed, holding that the ordinance furthered compelling governmental interests in ensuring that special interest groups could not ""corrupt"" the initiative process by spending large amounts to support or oppose a ballot measure, which interests outweighed the First Amendment interests infringed upon. Held:   The restraint imposed by the ordinance on the right of association, and, in turn, on individual and collective rights of expression, plainly contravenes both the right of association and the speech guarantees of the First Amendment.  Pp.   454 U. S. 294 -300. (a) To place a limit on individuals wishing to band together to advance their views on a ballot measure, while placing no limit on individuals acting alone, is clearly a restraint on the right of association.   Buckley v. Valeo,   424 U. S. 1 , held that contributions to candidates or their committees could be restricted in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.  Here, there is no risk of corruption, because this case relates to contributions to committees favoring or opposing ballot measures.  Also, there is no risk that the voters will be in doubt as to the identity of those whose money supports or opposes a given ballot measure, since the contributors must make their identities known under the disclosure provisions of the ordinance.  Under the exacting judicial review appropriate for infringements   of First Amendment rights, the $250 limit is unconstitutional.  Pp.   454 U. S. 295 -299. (b) The contribution limit automatically affects expenditures, and limits on expenditures operate as a direct restraint on freedom of expression of groups and individuals wishing to express themselves through groups.

 THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   An ordinance of appellant village requires a business to obtain a license if it sells any items that are ""designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs.""  Guidelines define the items (such as ""roach clips,"" which are used to smoke cannabis, ""pipes,"" and ""paraphernalia""), the sale of which is required to be licensed.  Appellee, which sold a variety of merchandise in its store, including ""roach clips"" and specially designed pipes used to smoke marihuana, upon being notified that it was in possible violation of the ordinance, brought suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and requesting injunctive and declaratory relief and damages.  The District Court upheld the ordinance and awarded judgment to the village defendants.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague on its face. Held:   The ordinance is not facially overbroad or vague, but is reasonably clear in its application to appellee.  Pp.   455 U. S. 494 -505. (a) In a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of an enactment, a court must first determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.  If it does not, the overbreadth challenge must fail.  The court should then examine the facial vagueness challenge and should uphold such challenge only if the enactment is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.  Pp.   455 U. S. 494 -495. (b) The ordinance here does not violate appellee's First Amendment rights, nor is it overbroad because it inhibits such rights of other parties.  The ordinance does not restrict speech as such, but simply regulates the commercial marketing of items that the labels reveal may be used for an illicit purpose, and thus does not embrace noncommercial speech.  With respect to any commercial speech interest implicated, the ordinance's restriction on the manner of marketing does not appreciably limit appellee's communication of information, except to the extent it is directed at commercial activity promoting or encouraging illegal drug use, an activity which, if deemed ""speech,"" is speech proposing an illegal transaction, and thus subject to government regulation or ban.  It is irrelevant whether the ordinance has an overbroad scope encompassing other persons' commercial speech, since the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.  Pp.   455 U. S. 495 -497.  (c) With respect to the facial vagueness challenge, appellee has not shown that the ordinance is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.  The ordinance's language ""designed . . . for use"" is not unconstitutionally vague on its face, since it is clear that such standard encompasses at least an item that is principally used with illegal drugs by virtue of its objective features,  i.e.,  features designed by the manufacturer.  Thus, the ""designed for use"" standard is sufficiently clear to cover at least some of the items that appellee sold, such as ""roach clips"" and the specially designed pipes.  As to the ""marketed for use"" standard, the guidelines refer to the display of paraphernalia and to the proximity of covered items to otherwise uncovered items, and thus such standard requires scienter on the part of the retailer.  Under this test, appellee had ample warning that its marketing activities required a license, and by displaying a certain magazine and certain books dealing with illegal drugs physically close to pipes and colored rolling paper, it was in clear violation of the guidelines, as it was in selling ""roach clips.""  Pp.   455 U. S. 499 -503. (d) The ordinance's language is sufficiently clear that the speculative danger of arbitrary enforcement does not render it void for vagueness in a pre-enforcement facial challenge.  Pp.   455 U. S. 503 -504. 639 F.2d 373, reversed and remanded. MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, POWELL, REHNQUIST, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.

Hartlage No. 80-1285 Argued January 20, 1982 Decided April 5, 1982 456 U.S. 45 CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY
 Syllabus   Petitioner, the challenger, in a general election, for respondent's office as a Commissioner of Jefferson County, Ky., committed himself, at a televised press conference, to lowering Commissioners' salaries if elected.  Upon learning that such commitment arguably violated a provision of the Kentucky Corrupt Practices Act (§ 121.055), petitioner retracted his pledge.  On its face, § 121.055 prohibits a candidate from offering material benefits to voters in consideration for their votes.  After petitioner won the election, respondent filed suit in a Kentucky state court, alleging that petitioner had violated § 121.055 and seeking to have the election declared void.  Although finding that, under the reasoning of an earlier decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals construing § 121.055, petitioner had violated the statute by promising to reduce his salary to less than that ""fixed by law,"" the trial court concluded that petitioner had been ""fairly elected,"" and refused to order a new election.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed. Held:   Section 121.055 was applied in this case to limit speech in violation of the First Amendment.  Pp.   456 U. S. 522 . (a) Although the States have a legitimate interest in preserving the integrity of their electoral processes, when a State seeks to restrict directly a candidate's offer of ideas to the voters, the First Amendment requires that the restriction be demonstrably supported by not only a legitimate state interest, but a compelling one, and that the restriction operate without unnecessarily circumscribing protected expression.  Pp.   456 U. S. 52 -54. (b) The application of § 121.055 in this case cannot be justified as a prohibition on buying votes.  Petitioner's statements, which were made openly and were subject to the criticism of his political opponent and to the scrutiny of the voters, were very different in character from corrupting private agreements and solicitations historically recognized as unprotected by the First Amendment.  There is no constitutional basis upon which his pledge to reduce his salary may be equated with a candidate's promise to pay voters privately for their support from his own pocketbook.  A candidate's promise to confer some ultimate benefit on the voter,  qua  taxpayer, citizen, or member of the general public, does not lie beyond the pale of First Amendment protection.  Pp.   456 U. S. 559 .  (c) If § 121.055 was designed to further the State's interest in ensuring that the willingness of some persons to serve in public office without remuneration does not make gratuitous service the  sine qua non  of plausible candidacy -- resulting in persons of independent wealth but less ability being chosen over those who, though better qualified, cannot afford to serve at a reduced salary -- it chose a means unacceptable under the First Amendment.  The State's fear that voters might make an ill-advised choice does not provide the State with a compelling justification for limiting speech.  It is not the government's function to select which issues are worth discussing in the course of a political campaign.  Pp.   456 U. S. 59 -60. (d) Nor can application of § 121.055 here be justified on the basis of the State's interests and prerogatives with respect to factual misstatements, on the asserted ground that the statute bars promises to serve at a reduced salary only when the salary of the official has been ""fixed by law"" and the promise cannot, therefore, be delivered.  Erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the ""breathing space"" that they need to survive.  Nullifying petitioner's election victory would be inconsistent with the atmosphere of robust political debate required by the First Amendment.  There was no showing that he made the disputed statement other than in good faith and without knowledge of its falsity, or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.  Moreover, he retracted the statement promptly after determining that it might have been false.  Pp.   456 U. S. 60 -62. 618 S.W.2d 603, reversed and remanded.

Superior Court No. 81-611 Argued March 29, 1982 Decided June 23, 1982 457 U.S. 596 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS
 Syllabus   Appellee Massachusetts trial court, relying on a Massachusetts statute providing for exclusion of the general public from trials of specified sexual offenses involving a victim under the age of 18, ordered the exclusion of the press and public from the courtroom during the trial of a defendant charged with rape of three minor girls.  Appellant newspaper publisher challenged the exclusion order, and ultimately, after the trial had resulted in the defendant's acquittal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court construed the Massachusetts statute as requiring, under all circumstances, the exclusion of the press and public during the testimony of a minor victim in a sex-offense trial. Held: 1. The fact that the exclusion order expired with completion of the trial at which the defendant was acquitted does not render the controversy moot within the meaning of Art. III.  The controversy is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" since it can reasonably be assumed that appellant will someday be subjected to another order relying on the Massachusetts statute, and since criminal trials are typically of short duration.  Pp.   457 U. S. 602 -603. 2. The Massachusetts statute, as construed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, violates the First Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   457 U.S. 603 -607. (a) To the extent that the First Amendment embraces a right of access to criminal trials, it is to ensure that the constitutionally protected ""discussion of governmental affairs"" is an informed one.  The right of access to criminal trials in particular is properly afforded protection by the First Amendment both because such trials have historically been open to the press and public and because such right of access plays a particularly significant role in the functioning of the judicial process and the government as a whole.  Pp.   457 U.S. 603 -606. (b) The right of access to criminal trials is not absolute, but the circumstances under which the press and public can be barred are limited.  The State must show that denial of such right is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Pp.   457 U. S. 606 -607.  3. The Massachusetts statute cannot be justified on the basis of either the State's interest in protecting minor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment or its interest in encouraging such victims to come forward and testify in a truthful and credible manner.  Pp.   457 U. S. 607 -610. (a) Compelling as the first interest is, it does not justify a mandatory closure rule.  Such interest could be just as well served by requiring the trial court to determine on a case-by-case basis whether the State's legitimate concern for the minor victim's wellbeing necessitates closure.  Such an approach ensures that the constitutional right of the press and public to gain access to criminal trials will not be restricted except where necessary to protect the State's interest.  Pp.   457 U. S. 607 -609. (b) The second asserted interest is not only speculative in empirical terms, but is also open to serious question as a matter of logic and common sense.  Although the statute was construed to bar the press and public from the courtroom during a minor sex victim's testimony, the press is not denied access to the transcript, court personnel, or any other source that could provide an account of such testimony, and thus the statute cannot prevent the press from publicizing the substance of that testimony, as well as the victim's identity.

 Syllabus   A New York statute prohibits persons from knowingly promoting a sexual performance by a child under the age of 16 by distributing material which depicts such a performance.  The statute defines ""sexual performance"" as any performance that includes sexual conduct by such a child, and ""sexual conduct"" is in turn defined as actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sado-masochistic abuse, or lewd exhibition of the genitals.  Respondent bookstore proprietor was convicted under the statute for selling films depicting young boys masturbating, and the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed.  The New York Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statute violated the First Amendment as being both underinclusive and overbroad.  The court reasoned that, in light of the explicit inclusion of an obscenity standard in a companion statute banning the knowing dissemination of similarly defined material, the statute in question could not be construed to include an obscenity standard, and therefore would prohibit the promotion of materials traditionally entitled to protection under the First Amendment. Held:   As applied to respondent and others who distribute similar material, the statute in question does not violate the First Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.   458 U. S. 753 -774. (a) The States are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children for the following reasons:  (1) the legislative judgment that the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child easily passes muster under the First Amendment; (2) the standard of  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , for determining what is legally obscene is not a satisfactory solution to the child pornography problem; (3) the advertising and selling of child pornography provide an economic motive for, and are thus an integral part of, the production of such materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation; (4) the value of permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd exhibitions is exceedingly modest, if not  de minimis;  and (5) recognizing and classifying child pornography as a category of material outside the First Amendment's protection is not incompatible with this Court's decisions dealing with what speech is unprotected.  When a definable class of material, such as that covered by the New   York statute, bears so heavily and pervasively on the welfare of children engaged in its production, the balance of competing interests is clearly struck, and it is permissible to consider these materials as without the First Amendment's protection.  Pp.   458 U. S. 756 -764. (b) The New York statute describes a category of material the production and distribution of which is not entitled to First Amendment protection.  Accordingly, there is nothing unconstitutionally ""underinclusive"" about the statute, and the State is not barred by the First Amendment from prohibiting the distribution of such unprotected materials produced outside the State.  Pp.   458 U. S. 764 -766. (c) Nor is the New York statute unconstitutionally overbroad as forbidding the distribution of material with serious literary, scientific, or educational value.  The substantial overbreadth rule of  Broadrick v. Oklahoma,   413 U. S. 601 , applies.  This is the paradigmatic case of a state statute whose legitimate reach dwarfs its arguably impermissible applications. ""[W]hatever overbreadth may exist should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which [the statute's] sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied."" Broadrick v.

 Syllabus   In 1966, a boycott of white merchants in Claiborne County, Miss., was launched at a meeting of a local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attended by several hundred black persons.  The purpose of the boycott was to secure compliance by both civic and business leaders with a lengthy list of demands for equality and racial justice.  The boycott was largely supported by speeches encouraging nonparticipants to join the common cause and by nonviolent picketing, but some acts and threats of violence did occur.  In 1969, respondent white merchants filed suit in Mississippi Chancery Court for injunctive relief and damages against petitioners (the NAACP, the Mississippi Action for Progress, and a number of individuals who had participated in the boycott, including Charles Evers, the field secretary of the NAACP in Mississippi and a principal organizer of the boycott).  Holding petitioners jointly and severally liable for all of respondents' lost earnings during a 7-year period from 1966 to the end of 1972 on three separate conspiracy theories, including the tort of malicious interference with respondents' businesses, the Chancery Court imposed damages liability and issued a permanent injunction.  The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected two theories of liability, but upheld the imposition of liability on the basis of the common law tort theory.  Based on evidence that fear of reprisals caused some black citizens to withhold their patronage from respondents' businesses, the court held that the entire boycott was unlawful, and affirmed petitioners' liability for all damages ""resulting from the boycott"" on the ground that petitioners had  agreed  to use force, violence, and ""threats"" to effectuate the boycott. Held: 1. The nonviolent elements of petitioners' activities are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.  Pp.   458 U. S. 907 -915. (a) Through exercise of their First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, association, and petition, rather than through riot or revolution, petitioners sought to bring about political, social, and economic change.  Pp.   458 U. S. 907 -912. (b) While States have broad power to regulate economic activities, there is no comparable right to prohibit peaceful political activity such as that found in the boycott in this case.  Pp.   458 U. S. 912 -915.  2. Petitioners are not liable in damages for the consequences of their nonviolent, protected activity.  Pp.   458 U. S. 915 -920. (a) While the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity; only those losses proximately caused by the unlawful conduct may be recovered.  Pp.   458 U. S. 915 -918. (b) Similarly, the First Amendment restricts the ability of the State to impose liability on an individual solely because of his association with another.  Civil liability may not be imposed merely because an individual belonged to a group, some members of which committed acts of violence.  For liability to be imposed by reason of association alone, it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims.  Pp.   458 U. S. 918 -920. 3. The award for all damages ""resulting from the boycott"" cannot be sustained, where the record discloses that all of the respondents' business losses were not proximately caused by violence or threats of violence.  Pp.   458 U. S. 920 -932. (a) To the extent that the Mississippi Supreme Court's judgment rests on the ground that ""many"" black citizens were ""intimidated"" by ""threats"" of ""social ostracism, vilification, and traduction,"" it is flatly inconsistent with the First Amendment.  The court's ambiguous findings are inadequate to assure the ""precision of regulation"" demanded by that Amendment.  Pp.   458 U. S. 920 -924. (b) Regular attendance and participation at the meetings of the Claiborne County Branch of the NAACP is an insufficient predicate on which to impose liability on the individual petitioners.  Nor can liability be imposed on such individuals simply because they were either ""store watchers"" who stood outside the boycotted merchants' stores to record the names of black citizens who patronized the stores or members of a special group of boycott ""enforcers.""  Pp.   458 U. S. 924 -926. (c) For similar reasons, the judgment against Evers cannot be separately justified, nor can liability be imposed upon him on the basis of speeches that he made, because those speeches did not incite violence or specifically authorize the use of violence.  His acts, being insufficient to impose liability on him, may not be used to impose liability on the NAACP, his principal.  Moreover, there is no finding that Evers or any other NAACP member had either actual or apparent authority from the NAACP to commit acts of violence or to threaten violent conduct or that the NAACP ratified unlawful conduct.  To impose liability on the NAACP without such a finding would impermissibly burden the rights of political association that are protected by the First Amendment.  Pp.   458 U. S. 926 -932. 393 So. 2d 1290 , reversed and remanded.  STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.

 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 2 U.S.C. § 441b(a), prohibits corporations and labor unions from making contributions or expenditures in connection with federal elections.  The section, however, permits some participation by unions and corporations in the federal electoral process by allowing these organizations to establish and pay the expenses of ""separate segregated funds"" which may be used for political purposes during federal elections.  The Act restricts the operations of such segregated funds in several respects.  Of most relevance here, 2 U.S.C. §§ 441b(b)(4)(A) and 441b(b)(4)(C) provide that a corporation without capital stock may solicit contributions to a fund it has established only from ""members"" of the corporation.  During 1976, respondent National Right to Work Committee (NRWC), a corporation without capital stock, solicited some 267,000 persons for contributions to a separate segregated fund that it sponsored.  Petitioner Federal Election Commission determined that NRWC's solicitation violated § 441b(b)(4)(C), because the persons it had solicited were not its members.  Among other things, NRWC's solicitation letters did not mention membership, its articles of incorporation disclaim the existence of members, and members play no part in the operation or administration of the corporation. Held: 1. The persons solicited by NRWC were insufficiently attached to the corporation to qualify as members under § 441b(b)(4)(C).  This interpretation of the Act does not raise constitutional difficulties.  Pp.   459 U. S. 201 -207. 2. The First Amendment associational rights asserted by NRWC are overborne by the interests Congress has sought to protect in enacting § 441b.  The provision marks the culmination of a careful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws to prevent both actual and apparent corruption, and reflects a legislative judgment that the special characteristics of corporations require prophylactic measures.  Pp. 207-211. 214 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 665 F.2d 371, reversed. REHNQUIST, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. "

 THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Under a collective bargaining agreement between the Board of Education of Perry Township, Ind., and Perry Education Association (PEA) as the exclusive bargaining representative for the School District's teachers, PEA was granted access to the interschool mail system and teacher mailboxes in the Perry Township schools.  The bargaining agreement also provided that access rights to the mail facilities were not available to any rival union, such as Perry Local Educators' Association (PLEA).  PLEA and two of its members filed suit in Federal District Court against PEA and individual members of the School Board, contending that PEA's preferential access to the internal mail system violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court entered summary judgment for the defendants, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Held: 1. The appeal is not proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1254(2), which grants this Court appellate jurisdiction over federal court of appeals' decisions holding a state statute repugnant to the Federal Constitution.  Here, only certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, not the Indiana statute authorizing such agreements, were held to be constitutionally invalid, and the bargaining agreement cannot be considered to be in essence a legislative act.  However, regarding the jurisdictional statement as a petition for a writ of certiorari, certiorari is granted because the constitutional issues presented are important and the decision below conflicts with the judgments of other federal and state courts.  Pp.   460 U. S. 42 -44. 2. The First Amendment is not violated by the preferential access to the interschool mail system granted to PEA.  Pp.   460 U. S. 44 -54. (a) With respect to public property that is not, by tradition or government designation, a forum for public communication, a State may reserve the use of the property for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, as long as a regulation on speech is reasonable, and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view.   The school mail facilities were not a ""limited public forum"" merely because the system had been opened for periodic use by   civic and church organizations, or because PLEA was allowed to use the school mail facilities on an equal footing with PEA prior to PEA's certification as the teachers' exclusive bargaining representative.  Pp.   460 U. S. 45 -49. (b) The differential access provided PEA and PLEA is reasonable, because it is wholly consistent with the School District's legitimate interest in preserving the property for the use to which it was lawfully dedicated.  Use of school mail facilities enables PEA to perform effectively its statutory obligations as exclusive representative of all Perry Township teachers.  Conversely, PLEA does not have any official responsibility in connection with the School District, and need not be entitled to the same rights of access to school mailboxes.  The reasonableness of the limitations on PLEA's access to the school mail system is also supported by the substantial alternative channels that remain open for union-teacher communication to take place.  Moreover, under Indiana law, PLEA is assured of equal access to all modes of communication while a representation election is in progress.  Pp.   460 U. S. 50 -54. 3. The differential access provided the rival unions does not constitute impermissible content discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Since the grant of exclusive access to PEA does not burden a fundamental right of PLEA, the School District's policy need only rationally further a legitimate state purpose.  That purpose is clearly found in the special responsibilities of an exclusive bargaining representative.   Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley,   408 U. S. 92 , and  Carey v. Brown,   447 U.

 Syllabus   While exempting periodic publications from its general sales and use tax, Minnesota imposes a ""use tax"" on the cost of paper and ink products consumed in the production of such a publication, but exempts the first $100,000 worth of paper and ink consumed in any calendar year.  Appellant newspaper publisher brought an action seeking a refund of the ink and paper use taxes it had paid during certain years, contending that the tax violates,  inter alia,  the guarantee of the freedom of the press in the First Amendment.  The Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the tax. Held:   The tax in question violates the First Amendment.  Pp.   460 U. S. 579 -593. (a) There is no legislative history, and no indication, apart from the structure of the tax itself, of any impermissible or censorial motive on the part of the Minnesota Legislature in enacting the tax.   Grosjean v. American Press Co.,   297 U. S. 233 , distinguished.  Pp. 579-580. (b) But by creating the special use tax, which is without parallel in the State's tax scheme, Minnesota has singled out the press for special treatment.  When a State so singles out the press, the political constraints that prevent a legislature from imposing crippling taxes of general applicability are weakened, and the threat of burdensome taxes becomes acute.  That threat can operate as effectively as a censor to check critical comment by the press, thus undercutting the basic assumption of our political system that the press will often serve as an important restraint on government.  Moreover, differential treatment, unless justified by some special characteristic of the press, suggests that the goal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of expression, and such goal is presumptively unconstitutional.  Differential treatment of the press, then, places such a burden on the interests protected by the First Amendment that such treatment cannot be countenanced unless the State asserts a counterbalancing interest of compelling importance that it cannot achieve without differential taxation.  Pp.   460 U. S. 581 -585. (c) Minnesota has offered no adequate justification for the special treatment of newspapers.  Its interest in raising revenue, standing alone, cannot justify such treatment, for the alternative means of taxing businesses generally is clearly available.  And the State has offered no explanation of why it chose to use a substitute for the sales tax, rather   than the sales tax itself.  A rule that would automatically allow the State to single out the press for a different method of taxation as long as the effective burden is no different from that on other taxpayers or, as Minnesota asserts here, is lighter than that on other businesses, is to be avoided.  The possibility of error inherent in such a rule poses too great a threat to concerns at the heart of the First Amendment.  Pp.   460 U. S. 586 -590. (d) Minnesota's ink and paper tax violates the First Amendment not only because it singles out the press, but also because it targets a small group of newspapers.  The effect of the $100,000 exemption is that only a handful of publishers in the State pay any tax at all, and even fewer pay any significant amount of tax.  To recognize a power in the State not only to single out the press, but also to tailor the tax so that it singles out a few members of the press, presents such a potential for abuse that no interest suggested by Minnesota can justify the scheme.

 THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent was employed as an Assistant District Attorney in New Orleans with the responsibility of trying criminal cases. When petitioner District Attorney proposed to transfer respondent to prosecute cases in a different section of the criminal court, she strongly opposed the transfer, expressing her view to several of her supervisors, including petitioner.  Shortly thereafter, she prepared a questionnaire that she distributed to the other Assistant District Attorneys in the office concerning office transfer policy, office morale, the need for a grievance committee, the level ,of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns.  Petitioner then informed respondent that she was being terminated for refusal to accept the transfer, and also told her that her distribution of the questionnaire was considered an act of insubordination.  Respondent filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V), alleging that she was wrongfully discharged because she had exercised her constitutionally protected right of free speech.  The District Court agreed, ordered her reinstated, and awarded backpay, damages, and attorney's fees.  Finding that the questionnaire, not the refusal to accept the transfer, was the real reason for respondent's termination, the court held that the questionnaire involved matters of public concern and that the State had not ""clearly demonstrated"" that the questionnaire interfered with the operation of the District Attorney's office.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:  Respondent's discharge did not offend the First Amendment.  Pp.   461 U. S. 142 -154. (a) In determining a public employee's rights of free speech, the problem is to arrive ""at a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."" Pickering v. Board of Education,   391 U. S. 563 ,   391 U. S. 568 .  P.   461 U. S. 142 . (b) When a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not   the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.  Here, except for the question in respondent's questionnaire regarding pressure upon employees to work in political campaigns, the questions posed do not fall under the rubric of matters of ""public concern.""  Pp.   461 U. S. 143 -149. (c) The District Court erred in imposing an unduly onerous burden on the State to justify respondent's discharge by requiring it to ""clearly demonstrate"" that the speech involved ""substantially interfered"" with the operation of the office.  The State's burden in justifying a particular discharge varies depending upon the nature of the employee's expression.  Pp.   461 U. S. 149 -150. (d) The limited First Amendment interest involved here did not require petitioner to tolerate action that he reasonably believed would disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and destroy the close working relationships within the office.  The question on the questionnaire regarding the level of confidence in supervisors was a statement that carried the clear potential for undermining office relations.  Also, the fact that respondent exercised her rights to speech at the office supports petitioner's fears that the function of his office was endangered.  And the fact that the questionnaire emerged immediately after a dispute between respondent and petitioner and his deputies requires that additional weight be given to petitioner's view that respondent threatened his authority to run the office.

 Syllabus   Title 40 U.S.C. § 13k prohibits the ""display [of] any flag, banner, or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization, or movement"" in the United States Supreme Court building or on its grounds, which are defined to include the public sidewalks constituting the outer boundaries of the grounds.  One appellee was threatened with arrest by Court police officers for violation of the statute when he distributed leaflets concerning various causes on the sidewalk in front of the Court.  The other appellee was similarly threatened with arrest for displaying on the sidewalk a picket sign containing the text of the First Amendment.  Appellees then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking an injunction against enforcement of § 13k and a declaratory judgment that it was unconstitutional on its face.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  The Court of Appeals, after determining that such dismissal was erroneous, struck down § 13k on its face as an unconstitutional restriction on First Amendment rights in a public place. Held:   Section 13k, as applied to the public sidewalks surrounding the Court building, is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.  Pp.   461 U. S. 175 -184. (a) The conduct of each appellee falls into the statutory ban, and hence it is proper to reach the constitutional question involved.  Pp.   461 U. S. 175 -176. (b) As a general matter, peaceful picketing and leafletting are expressive activities involving ""speech"" protected by the First Amendment.  ""Public places,"" such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, historically associated with the free exercise of expressive activities, are considered, without more, to be ""public forums.""  In such places, the Government may enforce reasonable time, place, and manner regulations, but additional restrictions, such as an absolute prohibition of a particular type of expression, will be upheld only if narrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.  Pp.   461 U. S. 176 -178. (c) The Court grounds are not transformed into ""public forum"" property merely because the public is permitted to freely enter and leave the grounds at practically all times and is admitted to the building during specified hours.  But where the sidewalks forming the perimeter of the grounds are indistinguishable from any other sidewalks in Washington,   D.C., they should not be treated any differently, and thus are public forums for First Amendment purposes.  Pp.   461 U. S. 178 -180. (d) Insofar as it totally bans specified communicative activity on the public sidewalks around the Court grounds, § 13k cannot be justified as a reasonable place restriction.  A total ban on carrying a flag, banner, or device on the public sidewalks does not substantially serve the purposes of the statute of which § 13k is a part -- to provide for the maintenance of law and order on the Court grounds.  Nor do § 13k's prohibitions here at issue sufficiently serve the averred purpose of protecting the Court from outside influence or preventing it from appearing to the public that the Court is subject to such influence or that picketing or marching is an acceptable way of influencing the Court, where, as noted, the public sidewalks surrounding the Court grounds are no different than other public sidewalks in the city.

 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code) grants tax exemption to certain nonprofit organizations ""no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting to influence legislation.""  Section 170(c)(2) permits taxpayers who contribute to § 501(c)(3) organizations to deduct the amount of their contributions on their federal income tax returns.  Section 501(c)(4) grants tax-exempt status to certain nonprofit organizations, but contributions to these organizations are not deductible.  Taxation With Representation of Washington (TWR) is a nonprofit corporation organized to promote its view of the ""public interest"" in the area of federal taxation; it was formed to take over the operation of two other nonprofit organizations, one of which had tax-exempt status under § 501(c)(3) and the other under § 501(c)(4).  The Internal Revenue Service denied TWR's application for tax-exempt status under § 501(c)(3) because it appeared that a substantial part of TWR's activities would consist of attempting to influence legislation.  TWR then brought suit in Federal District Court against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the United States, claiming that § 501(c)(3)'s prohibition against substantial lobbying is unconstitutional under the First Amendment by imposing an ""unconstitutional burden"" on the receipt of tax-deductible contributions, and is also unconstitutional under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause because the Code permits taxpayers to deduct contributions to veterans' organizations that.qualify for tax exemption under § 501(c)(19).  The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that § 501(c)(3) does not violate the First Amendment, but does violate the Fifth Amendment. Held: 1. Section 501(c)(3) does not violate the First Amendment.  Congress has not infringed any First Amendment rights or regulated any First   Amendment activity, but has simply chosen not to subsidize TWR's lobbying out of public funds.   Cammarano v. United States,   358 U. S. 498 .  Pp.   461 U. S. 545 -546. 2. Nor does § 501(c)(3) violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  The sections of the Code at issue do not employ any suspect classification.  A legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe that right, and thus is not subject to strict scrutiny.  It was not irrational for Congress to decide that tax-exempt organizations such as TWR should not further benefit at the expense of taxpayers at large by obtaining a further subsidy for lobbying.  Nor was it irrational for Congress to decide that, even though it will not subsidize lobbying by charities generally, it will subsidize lobbying by veterans' organizations.  Pp.   461 U.

 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   Title 39 U.S.C. § 3001(e)(2) prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives.  When appellee manufacturer of contraceptives proposed to mail to the public unsolicited advertisements including informational pamphlets promoting its products but also discussing venereal disease and family planning, the Postal Service notified appellee that the proposed mailings would violate § 3001(e)(2).  Appellee then brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, which held that the statute, as applied to the proposed mailings, violated the First Amendment. Held:   As applied to appellee's proposed mailings, § 3001(e)(2) is unconstitutional.  Pp.   463 U. S. 64 -75. (a) The mailings, which are concededly advertisements, refer to specific products, and are economically motivated, constitute commercial speech notwithstanding the fact that they contain discussions of important public issues such as the prevention of venereal disease and family planning.  Pp.   463 U. S. 64 -68. (b) Advertising for contraceptives not only implicates ""substantial individual and societal interests"" in the free flow of commercial information, but also relates to activity that is protected from unwarranted governmental interference.  Thus, appellee's proposed commercial speech is clearly protected by the First Amendment.  P.   463 U. S. 69 . (c) Neither of the interests asserted by appellants -- that § 3001(e)(2) shields recipients of mail from materials that they are likely to find offensive and aids parents' efforts to control the manner in which their children become informed about birth control -- is sufficient to justify the sweeping prohibition on the mailing of unsolicited contraceptive advertisements.  The fact that protected speech may be offensive to some persons does not justify its suppression, and, in any event, recipients of objectionable mailings can avoid further offensiveness simply by averting their eyes or disposing of the mailings in a trash can.  While the second asserted interest is substantial, § 3001(e)(2), as a means of effectuating this interest, fails to withstand scrutiny.  The statute's marginal degree of protection afforded those parents who desire to keep their children from confronting such mailings is improperly achieved by purging all mailboxes of unsolicited material that is entirely suitable for adults.  Section 3001(e)(2) is also defective because it denies parents   truthful information bearing on their ability to discuss birth control and to make informed decisions in this area.  Pp.   463 U.

 FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A Minnesota statute (§ 290.09, subd. 22) allows state taxpayers, in computing their state income tax, to deduct expenses incurred in providing ""tuition, textbooks and transportation"" for their children attending an elementary or secondary school.  Petitioner Minnesota taxpayers brought suit in Federal District Court against respondent Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue and respondent parents who had taken the tax deduction for expenses incurred in sending their children to parochial schools, claiming that § 290.09, subd. 22, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by providing financial assistance to sectarian institutions.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that the statute is neutral on its face and in its application and does not have a primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   Section 290.09, subd. 22, does not violate the Establishment Clause, but satisfies all elements of the ""three-part"" test laid down in  Lemon v. Kurtzman,   403 U. S. 602 , that must be met for such a statute to be upheld under the Clause.  Pp.   463 U. S. 392 -403. (a) The tax deduction in question has the secular purpose of ensuring that the State's citizenry is well educated, as well as of assuring the continued financial health of private schools, both sectarian and nonsectarian.  Pp.   463 U. S. 394 -395. (b) The deduction does not have the primary effect of advancing the sectarian aims of nonpublic schools.  It is only one of many deductions -- such as those for medical expenses and charitable contributions -- available under the Minnesota tax laws; is available for educational expenses incurred by all parents, whether their children attend public schools or private sectarian or nonsectarian private schools,  Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist,   413 U. S. 756 , distinguished; and provides aid to parochial schools only as a result of decisions of individual parents, rather than directly from the State to the schools themselves.  The Establishment Clause's historic purposes do not encompass the sort of attenuated financial benefit that eventually flows to parochial schools from the neutrally available tax benefit at issue.  The fact that, notwithstanding § 290.09, subd. 22's facial neutrality, a particular annual statistical analysis shows that the statute's application primarily benefits religious institutions   does not provide the certainty needed to determine the statute's constitutionality.  Moreover, private schools, and parents paying for their children to attend these schools, make special contributions to the areas in which the schools operate.  Pp.   463 U. S. 396 -402. (c) Section 290.09, subd. 22, does not ""excessively entangle"" the State in religion.  The fact that state officials must determine whether particular textbooks qualify for the tax deduction and must disallow deductions for textbooks used in teaching religious doctrines is an insufficient basis for finding such entanglement.  P.   463 U. S. 403 . 676 F.2d 1195, affirmed. REHNQUIST, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and WHITE, POWELL, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.

 FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT
 Syllabus   Before the  voir dire  examination of prospective jurors began at a trial in California Superior Court for the rape and murder of a teenage girl, petitioner moved that the  voir dire  be open to the public and the press.  The State opposed the motion, arguing that, if the press were present, juror responses would lack the candor necessary to assure a fair trial.  The trial judge agreed and permitted petitioner to attend the ""general"" but not the ""individual""  voir dire  proceedings.  All but approximately three days of the 6-week  voir dire  was thus closed to the public.  After the jury was empaneled, petitioner moved for release of the complete transcript of the  voir dire  proceedings, but both defense counsel and the prosecutor argued that release of the transcript would violate the jurors' right to privacy.  The court denied the motion and, after the defendant had been convicted and sentenced to death, denied petitioner's second application for release of the  voir dire  transcript. Petitioner then sought in the California Court of Appeal a writ of mandate to compel the trial court to release the transcript and vacate the order closing the  voir dire  proceedings.  The petition was denied, and the California Supreme Court denied petitioner's request for a hearing. Held: 1. The guarantees of open public proceedings in criminal trials cover proceedings for the  voir dire  examination of potential jurors.  Pp.   464 U. S. 505 -510. (a) The historical evidence reveals that the process of selection of jurors has presumptively been a public process with exceptions only for good cause shown.  The presumptive openness of the jury selection process in England carried over into proceedings in colonial America, and public jury selection was the common practice in America when the Constitution was adopted.  Pp.   464 U. S. 505 -508. (b) Openness enhances both the basic fairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the criminal justice system.  Public proceedings vindicate the concerns of the victims and the community in knowing that offenders are being brought to account for their criminal conduct by jurors fairly and openly selected.  Closed proceedings, although not absolutely precluded, must be rare, and only for cause shown that outweighs the value of openness.    The presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Pp.   464 U. S. 508 -510. 2. The presumption of openness has not been rebutted in this case.  There were no findings to support the trial court's conclusion that an open proceeding would threaten the defendant's right to a fair trial and the prospective jurors' interests in privacy.  Even with findings adequate to support closure, the court's orders denying access to the  voir dire  transcript failed to consider whether alternatives were available to protect the prospective jurors' interests.  To preserve fairness and at the same time protect legitimate privacy, a trial judge should inform the prospective jurors, once the general nature of sensitive questions is made known to them, that those individuals believing public questioning will prove damaging because of embarrassment may properly request an opportunity to present the problem to the judge  in camera  but with counsel present and on the record.  When limited closure is ordered, the constitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time, if the judge determines that disclosure can be accomplished while safeguarding the juror's valid privacy interests.  Even then a valid privacy interest may rise to a level that part of the transcript should be sealed, or the name of a juror withheld, to protect the person from embarrassment.  Pp.   464 U. S. 510 -513. Vacated and remanded. BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BRENNAN, WHITE, BLACKMUN, POWELL, REHNQUIST, STEVENS, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.

 OF MINNESOTA, FOURTH DIVISION
 Syllabus   The Minnesota Public Employment Labor Relations Act (PELRA) authorizes state employees to bargain collectively over terms and conditions of employment.  The statute also grants professional employees, such as college faculty, the right to ""meet and confer"" with their employers on matters related to employment that are outside the scope of mandatory bargaining.  However, if professional employees forming an appropriate bargaining unit have selected an exclusive representative for mandatory bargaining, their employer may ""meet and confer"" on nonmandatory subjects only with that representative.  Appellant Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges (Board) operates the Minnesota community college system, and appellant Minnesota Community College Faculty Association (MCCFA) is the designated exclusive representative of the faculty of the State's community colleges.  On the state level, MCCFA and the Board established ""meet and confer"" committees to discuss policy questions applicable to the entire system.  On the campus level, the MCCFA chapters and the college administrations created local ""meet and confer"" committees to discuss policy questions applicable only to the campus.  Appellees, 20 Minnesota community college faculty instructors who are not members of MCCFA, filed suit in Federal District Court, challenging,  inter alia,  the constitutionality of MCCFA's exclusive representation of community college faculty in the ""meet and confer"" processes.  The District Court held that the ""meet and confer"" provisions of PELRA deprived appellees of their First and Fourteenth Amendment speech and associational rights by denying them an opportunity to participate in their employer's making of policy, and the court granted declaratory and injunctive relief. Held:   The ""meet and confer"" provisions do not violate appellees' constitutional rights.  Pp.   465 U. S. 280 -292. (a) Appellees have no constitutional right, either as members of the public, as state employees, or as college instructors, to force officers of the State acting in an official policymaking capacity to listen to appellees'   views.  Nothing in the First Amendment or in this Court's case law interpreting it suggests that the rights to speak, associate, and petition require government policymakers to listen or respond to communications of members of the public on public issues.  Neither appellees' status as public employees nor the fact that an academic setting is involved gives them any special constitutional right to a voice in the making of policy by their employer.  Even assuming that First Amendment speech rights take on a special meaning in an academic setting, they do not require government to allow teachers to participate in institutional policymaking.  Pp.   465 U. S. 280 -288. (b) Appellees' speech and associational rights have not been infringed by PELRA's restriction of participation in ""meet and confer"" sessions to the faculty's exclusive representative.  The State has not restrained appellees' freedom to speak on any education-related issue or to associate or not to associate with whom they please, including the exclusive representative.  Nor has the State attempted to suppress ideas.  Similarly, appellees' associational freedom has not been impaired, since they are free to form whatever advocacy groups they like.  Pp.   465 U. S. 288 -290. (c) Appellees' exclusion from ""meet and confer"" sessions does not deny them equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The State has a legitimate interest in ensuring that its public employers hear one, and only one, voice presenting the majority view of its professional employees on employment-related policy questions, and permitting selection of ""meet and confer"" representatives to be made by the exclusive representative is a rational means of serving that interest.

 Syllabus   The city of Pawtucket, R.I., annually erects a Christmas display in a park owned by a nonprofit organization and located in the heart of the city's shopping district.  The display includes, in addition to such objects as a Santa Claus house, a Christmas tree, and a banner that reads ""SEASONS GREETINGS,"" a creche or Nativity scene, which has been part of this annual display for 40 years or more.  Respondents brought an action in Federal District Court, challenging the inclusion of the creche in the display on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court upheld the challenge and permanently enjoined the city from including the creche in the display.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   Notwithstanding the religious significance of the creche, Pawtucket has not violated the Establishment Clause.  Pp.   465 U. S. 672 -687. (a) The concept of a ""wall"" of separation between church and state is a useful metaphor, but is not an accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists.  The Constitution does not require complete separation of church and state; it affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any.  Anything less would require the ""callous indifference,""  Zorach v. Clauson,   343 U. S. 306 ,   343 U. S. 314 , that was never intended by the Establishment Clause.  Pp.   465 U. S. 672 -673. (b) This Court's interpretation of the Establishment Clause comports with the contemporaneous understanding of the Framers' intent.  That neither the draftsmen of the Constitution, who were Members of the First Congress, nor the First Congress itself saw any establishment problem in employing Chaplains to offer daily prayers in the Congress is a striking example of the accommodation of religious beliefs intended by the Framers.  Pp.   465 U. S. 673 -674. (c) Our history is pervaded by official acknowledgment of the role of religion in American life, and equally pervasive is evidence of accommodation of all faiths and all forms of religious expression and hostility toward none.  Pp.   465 U. S. 674 -678.  (d) Rather than taking an absolutist approach in applying the Establishment Clause and mechanically invalidating all governmental conduct or statutes that confer benefits or give special recognition to religion in general or to one faith, this Court has scrutinized challenged conduct or legislation to determine whether, in reality, it establishes a religion or religious faith or tends to do so.  In the line-drawing process called for in each case, it has often been found useful to inquire whether the challenged law or conduct has a secular purpose, whether its principal or primary effect is to advance or inhibit religion, and whether it creates an excessive entanglement of government with religion.  But this Court has been unwilling to be confined to any single test or criterion in this sensitive area.  Pp.   465 U. S. 678 -679. (e) Here, the focus of the inquiry must be on the creche in the context of the Christmas season.  Focus exclusively on the religious component of any activity would inevitably lead to its invalidation under the Establishment Clause.  Pp.   465 U. S. 679 -680. (f) Based on the record in this case, the city has a secular purpose for including the creche in its Christmas display, and has not impermissibly advanced religion or created an excessive entanglement between religion and government.  The display is sponsored by the city to celebrate the Holiday recognized by Congress and national tradition and to depict the origins of that Holiday; these are legitimate secular purposes.  Whatever benefit to one faith or religion or to all religions inclusion of the creche in the display effects, is indirect, remote, and incidental, and is no more an advancement or endorsement of religion than the congressional and executive recognition of the origins of Christmas, or the exhibition of religious paintings in governmentally supported museums.  This Court is unable to discern a greater aid to religion from the inclusion of the creche than from the substantial benefits previously held not violative of the Establishment Clause.  As to administrative entanglement, there is no evidence of contact with church authorities concerning the content or design of the exhibition prior to or since the city's purchase of the creche.  No expenditures for maintenance of the creche have been necessary, and, since the city owns the creche, now valued at $200, the tangible material it contributes is  de minimis.   Political divisiveness alone cannot serve to invalidate otherwise permissible conduct, and, in any event, apart from the instant litigation, there is no evidence of political friction or divisiveness over the creche in the 40-year history of the city's Christmas celebration.  Pp.   465 U. S. 680 -685. (g) It would be ironic if the inclusion of the creche in the display, as part of a celebration of an event acknowledged in the Western World for 20 centuries, and in this country by the people, the Executive Branch,   Congress, and the courts for 2 centuries, would so ""taint"" the exhibition as to render it violative of the Establishment Clause.  To forbid the use of this one passive symbol while hymns and carols are sung and played in public places including schools, and while Congress and state legislatures open public sessions with prayers, would be an overreaction contrary to this Nation's history and this Court's holdings.

 FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent published an article in its magazine evaluating the quality of numerous brands of loudspeaker systems, including one marketed by petitioner.  Petitioner objected to statements in the article about its system, including one to the effect that the sound of individual musical instruments tended to wander ""about the room.""  When respondent refused to publish a retraction, petitioner filed a product disparagement action in Federal District Court.  The court ruled that petitioner was a ""public figure,"" and that therefore, pursuant to the First Amendment as interpreted in  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , to recover, petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent made a false disparaging statement with ""actual malice.""  Entering judgment for petitioner, the court found, based primarily on the testimony of the article's author (respondent's employee), that the article contained a false statement of ""fact,"" because the sound of instruments heard through the speakers tended to wander ""along the wall"" between the speakers, rather than ""about the room,"" as reported by respondent; that the author's testimony that the challenged statement was intended to mean ""along the wall"" was not credible; and that the statement was disparaging.  On the basis of what it considered to be clear and convincing proof, the court concluded that petitioner had sustained its burden of proving that respondent had published the false statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that its review of the ""actual malice"" determination was not limited to the ""clearly erroneous"" standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) -- which provides that ""[f]indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses"" -- and that it must perform a  de novo  review, independently examining the record to ensure that the District Court had applied properly the governing constitutional rule.  Based on its review of the record, the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner had not sustained its burden of proof. Held: 1. The clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) does not prescribe the standard of review to be applied in reviewing a determination of actual   malice in a case governed by  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.   Appellate judges in such a case must exercise independent judgment and determine whether the record establishes actual malice with convincing clarity.  Pp.   466 U. S. 498 -511. (a) In cases raising First Amendment issues, an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record to ensure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.  However, the standard of review must be faithful to both Rule 52(a) and the  New York Times  rule of independent review, the conflict between the two rules being in some respects more apparent than real.  For instance, Rule 52(a) does not forbid an examination of the entire record, and the constitutionally based rule of independent review permits giving ""due regard"" to the trial judge's opportunity to judge witnesses' credibility, as provided by Rule 52(a).  Pp.   466 U. S. 498 -501. (b) Rule 52(a) applies to findings of fact, but does not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct errors of law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of law and fact.  In a consideration of the possible application of Rule 52(a)'s distinction between questions of law and fact to the issue of ""actual malice,"" three characteristics of the  New York Times  rule are relevant:  (1) the common law heritage of the rule, (2) the fact that its content is given meaning through case-by-case adjudication, and (3) the fact that the constitutional values protected by it make it imperative that judges make sure that it is correctly applied.  Pp.   466 U. S. 501 -503. (c) The requirement of independent appellate review enunciated in  New York Times  reflects a deeply held conviction that judges -- particularly Members of this Court -- must exercise such review in order to preserve precious constitutional liberties.  Under  New York Times,  the question whether the evidence in the record in a defamation case is of the convincing clarity required to strip the utterance of First Amendment protection is ultimately a question of federal constitutional law.  Pp.   466 U. S. 503 -511. 2. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that there is a significant difference between proof of actual malice and mere proof of falsity, and that the requisite additional proof was lacking in this case.  The testimony of the article's author did not constitute clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.  The fact that he attempted to rationalize the mistake as to the article's use of the phrase ""about the room"" does not establish that he realized the inaccuracy at the time of publication.  The choice of the language used, though reflecting a misconception, did not place the speech beyond the outer limits of the First Amendment's broad protective umbrella.  Even accepting all of the District Court's purely   factual findings, nevertheless, as a matter of law, the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that respondent or its employee prepared the article with knowledge that it contained a false statement, or with reckless disregard of the truth.

 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Section 28.04 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibits the posting of signs on public property.  Appellee Taxpayers for Vincent, a group of supporters of a candidate for election to the Los Angeles City Council, entered into a contract with appellee Candidates' Outdoor Graphics Service (COGS) to fabricate and post signs with the candidate's name on them.  COGS produced cardboard signs and attached them to utility pole crosswires at various locations.  Acting under § 28.04, city employees routinely removed all posters (including the COGS signs) attached to utility poles and similar objects covered by the ordinance.  Appellees then filed suit in Federal District Court against appellants, the city and various city officials (hereafter City), alleging that § 28.04 abridged appellees' freedom of speech within the meaning of the First Amendment, and seeking damages and injunctive relief.  The District Court entered findings of fact, concluded that § 28.04 was constitutional, and granted the City's motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that the ordinance was presumptively unconstitutional because significant First Amendment interests were involved, and that the City had not justified its total ban on all signs on the basis of its asserted interests in preventing visual clutter, minimizing traffic hazards, and preventing interference with the intended use of public property. Held: 1. The ""overbreadth"" doctrine is not applicable here.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that § 28.04 will have any different impact on any third parties' interests in free speech than it has on appellees' interests, and appellees have failed to identify any significant difference between their claim that § 28.04 is invalid on overbreadth grounds and their claim that it is unconstitutional when applied to their signs during a political campaign.  Thus, it is inappropriate to entertain an overbreadth challenge to § 28.04.  Pp.   466 U. S. 796 -803. 2. Section 28.04 is not unconstitutional as applied to appellees' expressive activity.  Pp.   466 U. S. 803 -817. (a) The general principle that the First Amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas   at the expense of others is not applicable here.  Section 28.04's text is neutral -- indeed it is silent -- concerning any speaker's point of view, and the District Court's findings indicate that it has been applied to appellees and others in an evenhanded manner.  It is within the City's constitutional power to attempt to improve its appearance, and this interest is basically unrelated to the suppression of ideas.   Cf. United States v. O'Brien,   391 U. S. 367 ,   391 U. S. 377 .  Pp.   466 U. S. 803 -805. (b) Municipalities have a weighty, essentially esthetic interest in proscribing intrusive and unpleasant formats for expression.  The problem addressed by § 28.04 -- the visual assault on the citizens of Los Angeles presented by an accumulation of signs posted on public property -- constitutes a significant substantive evil within the City's power to prohibit.   Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego,   453 U. S. 490 .  Pp.   466 U. S. 805 -807. (c) Section 28.04 curtails no more speech than is necessary to accomplish its purpose of eliminating visual clutter.  By banning posted signs, the City did no more than eliminate the exact source of the evil it sought to remedy.  The rationale of  Schneider v. State,   308 U. S. 147 , which held that ordinances that absolutely prohibited handbilling on public streets and sidewalks were invalid, is inapposite in the context of the instant case.  Pp.   466 U. S. 808 -810. (d) The validity of the City's esthetic interest in the elimination of signs on public property is not compromised by failing to extend the ban to private property.  The private citizen's interest in controlling the use of his own property justifies the disparate treatment, and there is no predicate in the District Court's findings for the conclusion that the prohibition against the posting of appellees' signs fails to advance the City's esthetic interest.  Pp.   466 U. S. 810 -812. (e) While a restriction on expressive activity may be invalid if the remaining modes of communication are inadequate, § 28.04 does not affect any individual's freedom to exercise the right to speak and to distribute literature in the same place where the posting of signs on public property is prohibited.  The District Court's findings indicate that there are ample alternative modes of communication in Los Angeles.  P.   466 U. S. 812 . (f) There is no merit in appellees' suggestion that the property covered by § 28.04 either is itself a ""public forum,"" subject to special First Amendment protection, or at least should be treated in the same respect as the ""public forum"" in which the property is located.  The mere fact that government property can be used as a vehicle for communication -- such as the use of lampposts as signposts -- does not mean that the Constitution requires such use to be permitted.  Public property which is not, by tradition or designation, a forum for public communication may be reserved by the government for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, if the regulation on speech (as here) is reasonable and not an   effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view.  Pp.   466 U. S. 813 -815. (g) Although plausible policy arguments might well be made in support of appellees' suggestion that the City could have written an ordinance that would have had a less severe effect on expressive activity like theirs -- such as by providing an exception for political campaign signs -- it does not follow that such an exception is constitutionally mandated, nor is it clear that some of the suggested exceptions would even be constitutionally permissible.  To create an exception for appellees' political speech and not other types of protected speech might create a risk of engaging in constitutionally forbidden content discrimination.  The City may properly decide that the esthetic interest in avoiding visual clutter justifies a removal of all signs creating or increasing that clutter.  Pp.   466 U. S. 815 -817. 682 F.2d 847, reversed and remanded. STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and WHITE, POWELL, REHNQUIST, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.

 Syllabus   Respondent Rhinehart is the spiritual leader of a religious group, respondent Aquarian Foundation.  In recent years, petitioner newspaper companies published several stories about Rhinehart and the Foundation.  A damages action for alleged defamation and invasions of privacy was brought in a Washington state court by respondents (who also include certain members of the Foundation) against petitioners (who also include the authors of the articles and their spouses).  During the course of extensive discovery, respondents refused to disclose certain information, including the identity of the Foundation's donors and members.  Pursuant to state discovery Rules modeled on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the trial court issued an order compelling respondents to identify all donors who made contributions during the five years preceding the date of the complaint, along with the amounts donated.  The court also required respondents to divulge enough membership information to substantiate any claims of diminished membership.  However, pursuant to the State's Rule 26(c), the court also issued a protective order prohibiting petitioners from publishing, disseminating, or using the information in any way except where necessary to prepare for and try the case.  In seeking the protective order, respondents had submitted affidavits of several Foundation members averring that public release of the information would adversely affect Foundation membership and income and would subject its members to harassment and reprisals.  By its terms, the protective order did not apply to information gained by means other than the discovery process.  The Washington Supreme Court affirmed both the production order and the protective order, concluding that even if the latter order was assumed to constitute a prior restraint of free expression, the trial court had not violated its discretion in issuing the order. Held:   The protective order issued in this case does not offend the First Amendment.  Pp.   467 U. S. 29 -37. (a) In addressing the First Amendment question presented here, it is necessary to consider whether the ""practice in question [furthers] an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression"" and whether ""the limitation of First Amendment   freedoms [is] no greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved."" Procunier v. Martinez,   416 U. S. 396 ,   416 U. S. 413 . Pp. 31-32. (b) Judicial limitations on a party's ability to disseminate information discovered in advance of trial implicates the First Amendment rights of the restricted party to a far lesser extent than would restraints on dissemination of information in other contexts.  Rules authorizing discovery are a matter of legislative grace.  A litigant has no First Amendment right of access to information made available only for purposes of trying his suit.  Furthermore, restraints placed on discovered information are not a restriction on a traditionally public source of information.  Pp.   467 U. S. 32 -34. (c) Rule 26(c) furthers a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.  Liberal pretrial discovery under the State's Rules has a significant potential for abuse.  There is an opportunity for litigants to obtain -- incidentally or purposefully -- information that not only is irrelevant but, if publicly released, could be damaging to reputation and privacy.  The prevention of such abuse is sufficient justification for the authorization of protective orders.  Pp.   467 U. S. 34 -36. (d) The provision for protective orders in the Washington Rules -- conferring broad discretion on the trial court -- requires, in itself, no heightened First Amendment scrutiny.  The unique character of the discovery process requires that the trial court have substantial latitude to fashion protective orders.  P.   467 U. S. 36 . (e) In this case, the trial court entered the protective order upon a showing that constituted good cause as required by Rule 26(c).  Also, the order is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and does not restrict dissemination if the information is obtained from other sources.  It is sufficient for purposes of this Court's decision that the highest court in the State found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to issue a protective order pursuant to a constitutional state law.

 Syllabus   A Maryland statute prohibits a charitable organization, in connection with any fundraising activity, from paying expenses of more than 25% of the amount raised, but authorizes a waiver of this limitation where it would effectively prevent the organization from raising contributions.  Respondent is a professional fundraiser whose Maryland customers include various chapters of the Fraternal Order of Police, at least one of whom was reluctant to contract with respondent because of the statute's percentage limitation.  Respondent brought suit in a Maryland Circuit Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that it regularly charges an FOP chapter in excess of the 25% limitation, that petitioner Secretary of State had informed it that, if it refused to comply with the statute, it would be prosecuted, and that the statute violated its right to free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Without addressing petitioner's argument that respondent lacked standing to assert its claims, the Circuit Court upheld the statute, and the Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed.  The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had standing to challenge the statute's facial validity, that the statute was unconstitutional, and that its flaws were not remedied by the waiver provision. Held: 1. Respondent has standing to challenge the statute.  Not only does respondent satisfy the ""case"" or ""controversy"" requirement of Art. III, because it has suffered both threatened and actual injury as a result of the statute, but there also is no prudential reason against allowing respondent to challenge the statute.  Where the claim is that the statute is overly broad in violation of the First Amendment, the Court has allowed a party to assert the rights of another without regard to the ability of the other to assert his own claim. T he activity sought to be protected is at the heart of the business relationship between respondent and its customers, and respondent's interests in challenging the statute are completely consistent with the First Amendment interests of the charities it represents.  Petitioner's concern that respondent should not have standing to challenge the statute as overbroad because it has not demonstrated that the statute's overbreadth is ""substantial,"" is more properly   reserved for the determination of respondent's challenge on the merits.  Pp.   467 U. S. 954 -959. 2. Regardless of the waiver provision, the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad, its percentage restriction on charitable solicitation being an unconstitutional limitation on protected First Amendment solicitation activity.   Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment,   444 U. S. 620 .  Pp.   467 U. S. 959 -970. (a) The waiver provision does not save the statute.  Charitable organizations whose high solicitation and administrative costs are due to information dissemination, discussion, and advocacy of public issues, rather than to fraud, remain barred by the statute from carrying on those protected First Amendment activities.  Pp.   467 U. S. 962 -964. (b) This is not a ""substantial overbreadth"" case where the plaintiff must demonstrate that the statute ""as applied"" to him is unconstitutional.  Here there is no core of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable conduct that the statute prohibits.  The statute cannot distinguish organizations that have high fundraising costs not due to protected First Amendment activities from those that have high costs due to protected activity.  The flaw in the statute is not simply that it includes some impermissible applications, but that, in all its applications, it operates on a fundamentally mistaken premise that high solicitation costs are an accurate measure of fraud.  Where, as here, a statute imposes a direct restriction on protected First Amendment activity, and where the statute's defect is that the means chosen to accomplish the State's objectives are too imprecise, so that, in all its applications, the statute creates an unnecessary risk of chilling free speech, the statute is properly subject to facial attack.  Pp. 964-968. (c) Whether the statute regulates before- or after-the-fact is immaterial.  Whether the charity is prevented from engaging in protected First Amendment activity by lack of a solicitation permit or by knowledge that its fundraising activity is illegal if it cannot satisfy the percentage limitation, the chill on the protected activity is the same.  The facts that the statute restricts only fundraising expenses, and not other expenses, and that a charity may elect whether to be bound by its fundraising percentage for the prior year or to apply the 25% limitation on a campaign-by-campaign basis, do nothing to alter the fact that the significant fundraising activity protected by the First Amendment is barred by the percentage limitation.  And the fact that the statute regulates all charitable fundraising, and not just door-to-door solicitation, does not remedy the fact that the statute promotes the State's interests only peripherally.  Pp. 968-970. 294 Md. 160, 448 A.2d 935, affirmed.  BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT 
 Syllabus   In 1982, the National Park Service issued a permit to respondent Community for Creative Non-Violence (CCNV) to conduct a demonstration in Lafayette Park and the Mall, which are National Parks in the heart of Washington, D.C.  The purpose of the demonstration was to call attention to the plight of the homeless, and the permit authorized the erection of two symbolic tent cities.  However, the Park Service, relying on its regulations -- particularly one that permits ""camping"" (defined as including sleeping activities) only in designated campgrounds, no campgrounds having ever been designated in Lafayette Park or the Mall -- denied CCNV's request that demonstrators be permitted to sleep in the symbolic tents.  CCNV and the individual respondents then filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging,  inter alia,  that application of the regulations to prevent sleeping in the tents violated the First Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Park Service, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Held:   The challenged application of the Park Service regulations does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.   468 U. S. 293 -299. (a) Assuming that overnight sleeping in connection with the demonstration is expressive conduct protected to some extent by the First Amendment, the regulation forbidding sleeping meets the requirements for a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction of expression, whether oral, written, or symbolized by conduct.  The regulation is neutral with regard to the message presented, and leaves open ample alternative methods of communicating the intended message concerning the plight of the homeless.  Moreover, the regulation narrowly focuses on the Government's substantial interest in maintaining the parks in the heart of the Capital in an attractive and intact condition, readily available to the millions of people who wish to see and enjoy them by their presence.  To permit camping would be totally inimical to these purposes.  The validity of the regulation need not be judged solely by reference to the demonstration at hand, and none of its provisions are unrelated to the ends that it was designed to serve.  Pp.   468 U. S. 293 -298. (b) Similarly, the challenged regulation is also sustainable as meeting the standards for a valid regulation of expressive conduct.  Aside from   its impact on speech, a rule against camping or overnight sleeping in public pars is not beyond the constitutional power of the Government to enforce.  And as noted above, there is a substantial Government interest, unrelated to suppression of expression, in conserving park property that is served by the proscription of sleeping.  Pp.   468 U.

 CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (Act) established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a nonprofit corporation, to disburse federal funds to noncommercial television and radio stations in support of station operations and educational programming.  Section 399 of the Act forbids any noncommercial educational station that receives a grant from the CPB to ""engage in editorializing.""  Appellees (Pacifica Foundation, a nonprofit corporation that owns and operates several noncommercial educational broadcasting stations that receive grants from the CPB, the League of Women Voters of California, and an individual listener and viewer of public broadcasting) brought an action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of § 399.  The District Court granted summary judgment in appellees' favor, holding that § 399 violates the First Amendment. Held:   Section 399's ban on editorializing violates the First Amendment.  Pp.   468 U. S. 374 -402. (a) Congress, acting pursuant to the Commerce Clause, has power to regulate the use of the broadcast medium.  In the exercise of this power, Congress may seek to assure that the public receives through this medium a balanced presentation of information and views on issues of public importance that otherwise might not be addressed if control of the medium were left entirely in the hands of the owners and operators of broadcasting stations.  At the same time, since broadcasters are engaged in a vital and independent form of communicative activity, the First Amendment must inform and give shape to the manner in which Congress exercises its regulatory power.  Thus, although the broadcasting industry operates under restrictions not imposed upon other media, the thrust of these restrictions has generally been to secure the public's First Amendment interest in receiving a balanced presentation of views on diverse matters of public concern.  As a result, the absolute freedom to advocate one's own positions without also presenting opposing viewpoints -- a freedom enjoyed, for example, by newspaper publishers -- is denied to broadcasters.  Such restrictions have been upheld   by this Court only when they were narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest, such as ensuring adequate and balanced coverage of public issues.  Pp.   468 U. S. 374 -381. (b) The restriction imposed by § 399 is specifically directed at a form of speech -- the expression of editorial opinions -- that lies at the heart of First Amendment protection, and is defined solely on the basis of the content of the suppressed speech.  Section 399 singles out noncommercial broadcasters and denies them the right to address their chosen audience on matters of public importance.  Pp.   468 U. S. 381 -384. (c) Section 399's broad ban on all editorializing by every station that receives CPB funds far exceeds what is necessary to protect against the risk of governmental interference or to prevent the public from assuming that editorials by public broadcasting stations represent the official view of government.  The ban impermissibly sweeps within it a wide range of speech by wholly private stations on topics that do not take a directly partisan stand or that have nothing whatever to do with federal, state, or local government.  Pp.   468 U. S. 386 -395. (d) The patent overinclusiveness and underinclusiveness of § 399's ban also undermines the likelihood of a genuine governmental interest in preventing private groups from propagating their own views via public broadcasting.  Section 399 does not prevent the use of noncommercial stations for the presentation of partisan views on controversial matters; instead, it merely bars a station from specifically labeling such issues as its own or those of its management.  Pp.   468 U. S. 396 -399. (e) Section 399 cannot be justified on the basis of Congress' spending power as simply determining that Congress will not subsidize public broadcasting station editorials.   Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington,   461 U. S. 540 , distinguished.  Since a noncommercial educational station that receives only 1% of its income from CPB grants is barred absolutely from editorializing, such a station has no way of limiting the use of its federal funds to noneditorial activities, and, more importantly, it is barred from using even private funds to finance its editorial activity.  Pp.   468 U. S. 399 -401. 547 F. Supp. 379 , affirmed. BRENNAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.

 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Appellee United States Jaycees is a nonprofit national membership corporation whose objective, as stated in its bylaws, is to pursue such educational and charitable purposes as will promote and foster the growth and development of young men's civic organizations.  The bylaws establish several classes of membership, including individual regular and associate members and local chapters.  Regular membership is limited to young men between the ages of 18 and 35, while associate membership is available to persons ineligible for regular membership, principally women and older men.  An associate member may not vote or hold local or national office.  Two local chapters in Minnesota have been violating the bylaws for several years by admitting women as regular members, and, as a result, have had a number of sanctions imposed on them by appellee, including denying their members eligibility for state or national office.  When these chapters were notified by appellee that revocation of their charters was to be considered, members of both chapters filed discrimination charges with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, alleging that the exclusion of women from full membership violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act (Act), which makes it ""an unfair discriminatory practice . . . [t]o deny any person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation because of race, color, creed, religion, disability, national origin or sex."" Before a hearing took place on the state charges, appellee brought suit against appellant state officials to prevent enforcement of the Act, alleging that, by requiring appellee to accept women as regular members, application of the Act would violate the male members' constitutional rights of free speech and association.  Ultimately, a state hearing officer decided against appellee, and the District Court certified to the Minnesota Supreme Court the question whether appellee is ""a place of public accommodation"" within the meaning of the Act.  That court answered the question in the affirmative, and, in the course of its holding, suggested that, unlike appellee, the Kiwanis Club might be sufficiently ""private"" to be outside the Act's scope.  Appellee then amended its federal complaint to claim that the   Minnesota Supreme Court's interpretation of the Act rendered it unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  After trial, the District Court entered judgment in appellants' favor.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that application of the Act to appellee's membership policies would produce a ""direct and substantial"" interference with appellee's freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment. and, in the alternative, that the Act was vague as construed and applied, and hence unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Held: 1. Application of the Act to appellee to compel it to accept women as regular members does not abridge either the male members' freedom of intimate association or their freedom of expressive association.  Pp.   468 U. S. 617 -629. (a) Several features of appellee's organization place it outside the category of highly personal relationships entitled to constitutional protection against unjustified interference by the State.  Local chapters are neither small nor selective, no criteria being employed for judging applicants for membership.  Moreover, many of the activities central to the formation and maintenance of the association of members with one another involve the participation of strangers to that relationship, numerous nonmembers of both genders regularly participating in a substantial portion of the activities.  Accordingly, local chapters lack the distinctive characteristics that might afford constitutional protection to their members' decision to exclude women.  Pp.   468 U. S. 618 -622. (b) Minnesota's compelling interest in eradicating discrimination against its female citizens, an interest unrelated to the suppression of expression, justifies the impact that application of the Act to appellee may have on its male members' freedom of expressive association.  By prohibiting gender discrimination in places of public accommodation, the Act protects the State's citizenry from a number of serious social and personal harms.  Assuring women equal access to the goods, privileges, and advantages of a place of public accommodation clearly furthers compelling state interests.  In applying the Act to appellee, the State has advanced those interests through the least restrictive means of achieving its ends.  There is no basis in the record for concluding that admission of women as full voting members will impede appellee's ability to engage in its constitutionally protected civic, charitable, lobbying, fundraising, and other activities, or to disseminate its preferred views.  In any event, even if enforcement of the Act causes some incidental abridgment of appellee's protected speech, that effect is not greater than necessary to accomplish the State's legitimate purposes.  Pp.   468 U. S. 622 -629.  2. The Act is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  The due process concerns of the void-for-vagueness doctrine are not seriously implicated by the Act, either on its face or as construed in this case.  The Minnesota Supreme Court's construction of the Act by use of objective criteria typically employed in determining the applicability of antidiscrimination statutes to the membership policies of assertedly private clubs ensures that the Act's reach is readily ascertainable.  The contrast that court drew between appellee and the Kiwanis Club also disposes of appellee's contention that the Act is unconstitutionally overbroad.  That court's articulated willingness to adopt limiting constructions that would exclude private groups from the Act's reach, together with the commonly used and sufficiently precise standards it employed to determine that appellee is not such a group, establishes that the Act, as construed, does not create an unacceptable risk of application to a substantial amount of protected conduct.  Pp. 629-631. 709 F.2d 1560, reversed. BRENNAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which WHITE, MARSHALL, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, and in Parts I and III of which O'CONNOR, J., joined.  O'CONNOR, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment,  post,  p.   468 U. S. 631 .  REHNQUIST, J., concurred in the judgment.  BURGER, C.J., and BLACKMUN, J., took no part in the decision of the case. "

 Syllabus   Title 18 U.S.C. § 474 makes it a crime to photograph any obligation or other security of the United States.  But 18 U.S.C. § 504(1) permits the printing or publishing of illustrations of any such obligation or other security ""for philatelic, numismatic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purposes in articles, books, journals, newspapers, or albums"" if the illustrations are in black and white and less than three-fourths or more than one and one-half the size of the original and if the negative and plates used in making the illustrations are destroyed after their final authorized use.  Appellee magazine publisher, after being warned that it was violating §§ 474 and 504 by publishing a photographic color reproduction of United States currency on the cover of one of its magazines, brought an action in Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes were unconstitutional on their face and as applied to appellee, and an injunction preventing their enforcement.  The District Court, ruling in appellee's favor, held that the statutes violated the First Amendment. Held:   The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part. 539 F.

 EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
 Syllabus   The Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act (Fund Act) offers the Presidential candidates of major political parties the option of receiving public financing for their general election campaigns.  If the candidate elects public financing, the Act, in 26 U.S.C. § 9012(f), makes it a criminal offense for an independent ""political committee"" to expend more than $1,000 to further that candidate's election.  Believing that § 9012(f) would prohibit appellee independent political committees' intended substantial expenditures in support of President Reagan's reelection in 1984, appellant Democratic Party and appellant Democratic National Committee (Democrats) filed an action in Federal District Court against appellees, seeking a declaration that § 9012(f) is constitutional.  Appellant Federal Election Commission (FEC) brought a separate action against the same defendants seeking the same relief, and the two actions were consolidated.  The District Court held that the Democrats had standing under 26 U.S.C. § 9011(b)(1) -- which authorizes the FEC, ""the national committee of any political party, and individuals eligible to vote for President"" to institute such actions ""as may be appropriate to implement or con[s]true any provisions of [the Fund Act]"" -- to seek the requested declaratory relief, but that the Democrats and the FEC were not entitled to a declaration that § 9012(f) is constitutional.  The court then held § 9012(f) unconstitutional on its face because it violated First Amendment freedoms of speech and association. Held: 1. The Democrats lack standing under § 9011(b)(1).    470 U. S.    484-489. (a) Contrary to the Democrats' assertion that there is no need to resolve the issue of their standing, raised in the FEC's appeal, because the FEC clearly has standing and the legal issues and relief requested are the same in both actions, this Court will decide the issue.  It is squarely presented in the Democrats' appeal from the District Court's   determination that § 9011(b)(1) is unconstitutional, and if the District Court's decision that the Democrats have standing is allowed to stand, it could seriously interfere with the FEC's exclusive jurisdiction to determine how and when to enforce the Fund Act.  Pp.   470 U. S. 484 -486. (b) The plain language of § 9011(b)(1) and § 306(b)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) -- which provides that the FEC ""shall administer, seek to obtain compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to"" the Fund Act and confers on the FEC ""exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement"" of the Act -- clearly shows that the Democrats have no standing to bring a private action against another private party.  The Democratic Party is clearly not included within those authorized by § 9011(b)(1) to bring an action.  And, while the Democratic National Committee is authorized to bring an action, the action must be ""appropriate"" to implement or construe the provision of the Fund Act at issue.  Reading § 306(b)(1) of the FECA and 26 U.S.C. § 9010(a) -- which authorizes the FEC to appear in and defend against any action filed under § 9011 -- together with § 9011, ""appropriate"" actions by private parties are those that do not interfere with the FEC's responsibilities for administering and enforcing the Fund Act.  Accordingly, private suits to construe or enforce the Act are inappropriate interference with those responsibilities.  Pp.   470 U. S. 486 -489. 2. Section 9012(f) violates the First Amendment.  Pp.   470 U. S. 490 -501. (a) The expenditures at issue are squarely prohibited by § 9012(f).  And, as producing speech at the core of the First Amendment and implicating the freedom of association, they are entitled to full protection under that Amendment.  Pp.   470 U. S. 490 -496. (b) Section 9012(f)'s limitation on independent expenditures by political committees is constitutionally infirm, absent any indication that such expenditures have a tendency to corrupt or to give the appearance of corruption.  But even assuming that Congress could fairly conclude that large-scale political action committees have a sufficient tendency to corrupt, § 9012(f) is a fatally overbroad response to that evil.  It is not limited to multimillion dollar war chests, but applies equally to informal discussion groups that solicit neighborhood contributions to publicize their views about a particular Presidential candidate.  Pp.   470 U. S. 496 -500. (c) Section 9012(f) cannot be upheld as a prophylactic measure deemed necessary by Congress.  The groups and associations in question here, designed expressly to participate in political debate, are quite different from the traditional organizations organized for economic gain that may properly be prohibited from making contributions to political candidates.

 Syllabus   A July, 1980, Presidential Proclamation directed certain young male citizens to register with the Selective Service System during a specified week.  Petitioner fell within the prescribed class, but did not register.  Instead, he wrote letters to Government officials, including the President, stating that he had not registered and did not intend to do so.  These letters were added to a Selective Service file of young men who advised that they had failed to register or who were reported by others as having failed to register.  Subsequently, Selective Service adopted a policy of passive enforcement under which it would investigate and prosecute only the nonregistration cases contained in this file.  In furtherance of this policy, Selective Service, in June, 1981, sent a letter to each reported nonregistrant warning that a failure to register could result in criminal prosecution.  Petitioner received such a letter, but did not respond.  Thereafter, Selective Service transmitted to the Department of Justice, for investigation and potential prosecution, the names of petitioner and others identified under the passive enforcement policy.  The Department of Justice, after screening out those who appeared not to be required to register, referred the remaining names to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and appropriate United States Attorneys.  Petitioner's name was one of those so referred.  Then, pursuant to the Department of Justice's so-called ""beg"" policy, whereby United States Attorneys, assisted by the FBI, made an effort to persuade nonregistrants to change their minds, the United States Attorney for petitioner's district sent him a letter urging him to register or face possible prosecution.  Again petitioner failed to respond.  Nor did he register during an authorized grace period or after further urging by FBI agents to do so.  Accordingly, he was indicted for knowingly and willfully failing to register in violation of the Military Selective Service Act.  The District Court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the Government had failed to rebut petitioner's  prima facie  case of selective prosecution.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although petitioner had shown that others similarly situated had not been prosecuted for conduct similar to his, he had not shown that the Government focused its investigation on him because of his protest activities.  Held:   The Government's passive enforcement policy, together with its ""beg"" policy, did not violate either the First or Fifth Amendment.  Pp.   470 U. S. 607 -614. (a) Selective prosecution claims may appropriately be judged according to ordinary equal protection standards.  These standards require petitioner to show both that the passive enforcement policy had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.  Petitioner has not met this burden.  All he has shown is that those eventually prosecuted, along with many not prosecuted, reported themselves as having violated the law.  He has not shown that the enforcement policy selected nonregistrants for prosecution on the basis of their speech.  The fact that the Government prosecuted those nonregistrants who reported themselves or who were reported by others demonstrates that the Government treated all reported nonregistrants equally, and did not subject vocal nonregistrants to any special burden.  But even if the passive policy had a discriminatory effect, petitioner has not shown that the Government intended such a result.  Absent a showing that the Government prosecuted petitioner because of his protest activities, his claim of selective prosecution fails.  Pp.   470 U. S. 607 -610. (b) With respect to the First Amendment, Government regulation is justified if (1) it is within the Government's constitutional power, (2) it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest, (3) the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free speech, and (4) the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.   United States v. O'Brien,   391 U. S. 367 .  In this case, neither the first nor third requirement is disputed, and the passive enforcement policy meets both the second and fourth requirements.  The reasons the Government offers in defense of the passive enforcement policy -- it promotes prosecutorial efficiency, the nonregistrants' letters to Selective Service provided strong evidence of their intent not to comply, and prosecution of visible nonregistrants was an efficient way to promote general deterrence -- are sufficiently compelling to satisfy the second requirement as to either those who reported themselves or those who were reported by others.  The passive enforcement policy meets the fourth requirement, for it placed no more limitation on speech than was necessary to ensure registration, and was the only effective interim solution available to carry out the Government's compelling interest.

 Syllabus   In proceedings instituted in Federal District Court, appellees challenged the constitutionality of,  inter alia,  a 1981 Alabama Statute (§ 16-1-20.1) authorizing a 1-minute period of silence in all public schools ""for meditation or voluntary prayer.""  Although finding that § 16-1-20.1 was an effort to encourage a religious activity, the District Court ultimately held that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does not prohibit a State from establishing a religion.  The Court of Appeals reversed. Held:   Section 16-1-20.1 is a law respecting the establishment of religion, and thus violates the First Amendment.  Pp.   472 U. S. 48 -61. (a) The proposition that the several States have no greater power to restrain the individual freedoms protected by the First Amendment than does Congress is firmly embedded in constitutional jurisprudence.  The First Amendment was adopted to curtail Congress' power to interfere with the individual's freedom to believe, to worship, and to express himself in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience, and the Fourteenth Amendment imposed the same substantive limitations on the States' power to legislate.  The individual's freedom to choose his own creed is the counterpart of his right to refrain from accepting the creed established by the majority.  Moreover, the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all.  Pp.   472 U. S. 48 -55. (b) One of the well-established criteria for determining the constitutionality of a statute under the Establishment Clause is that the statute must have a secular legislative purpose.   Lemon v. Kurtzman,   403 U. S. 602 ,   403 U. S. 612 -613.  The First Amendment requires that a statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion.  Pp.   472 U. S. 55 -56. (c) The record here not only establishes that § 16-1-20.1's purpose was to endorse religion, it also reveals that the enactment of the statute was not motivated by any clearly secular purpose.  In particular, the statements of § 16-120.1's sponsor in the legislative record and in his   testimony before the District Court indicate that the legislation was solely an ""effort to return voluntary prayer"" to the public schools.  Moreover, such unrebutted evidence of legislative intent is confirmed by a consideration of the relationship between § 16-1-20.1 and two other Alabama statutes -- one of which, enacted in 1982 as a sequel to § 16-1-20.1, authorized teachers to lead ""willing students"" in a prescribed prayer, and the other of which, enacted in 1978 as § 16-1-20. l's predecessor, authorized a period of silence ""for meditation"" only.  The State's endorsement, by enactment of § 16-1-20.1, of prayer activities at the beginning of each schoolday is not consistent with the established principle that the government must pursue a course of complete neutrality toward religion.  Pp.   472 U. S. 56 -61. 705 F.2d 1526 and 713 F.2d 614, affirmed. STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BRENNAN, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and POWELL, JJ., joined.

 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent filed a libel action against petitioner in a North Carolina state court under the common law of that State, alleging that while respondent was being considered for the position of United States Attorney, petitioner wrote two letters to President Reagan (and sent copies to other Government officials) containing ""false, slanderous, libelous, inflammatory and derogatory statements"" concerning respondent, and that petitioner knew that the statements were false and maliciously intended to injure respondent by undermining his prospect of being appointed United States Attorney.  Seeking compensatory and punitive damages, respondent also alleged,  inter alia,  that the letters had their intended effect, resulting in his not being appointed, and that his reputation and career as an attorney were injured.  Petitioner removed the case to Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship and then moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the Petition Clause of the First Amendment -- which guarantees ""the right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances"" -- provided absolute immunity from liability.  The District Court held that the Clause does not grant absolute immunity, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. The Petition Clause does not provide absolute immunity to defendants charged with expressing libelous and damaging falsehoods in petitions to Government officials.  Although the value in the right of petition as an important aspect of self-government is beyond question, it does not follow that the Framers of the First Amendment believed that the Petition Clause provided absolute immunity from damages for libel.  In 1845, this Court, after reviewing the common law, held in  White v. Nicholls ,  3 How. 266, that a petition to a Government official was actionable if prompted by ""express malice,"" which was defined as ""falsehood and the absence of probable cause,"" and nothing has been presented to suggest that that holding should be altered.  Nor do the Court's decisions interpreting the Petition Clause in contexts other than defamation indicate that the right to petition is absolute.  The Clause was inspired by the same ideals of liberty and democracy that resulted in the First Amendment freedoms to speak, publish, and assemble, and there is no    sound basis for granting greater constitutional protection to statements made in a petition than other First Amendment expressions.  Pp.   472 U. S. 482 -485. 2. Under North Carolina common law, damages may be recovered only if petitioner is shown to have acted with ""malice,"" as defined in terms that the North Carolina Court of Appeals considered to be consistent with  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 .  The Petition Clause does not require the State to expand this privilege into an absolute one.  P.   472 U. S. 485 . 737 F.2d 427,  affirmed. BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except POWELL, J., who took no part in the decision of the case.

 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A Washington statute declares to be a ""moral nuisance"" any place ""where lewd films are publicly exhibited as a regular course of business"" or ""in which lewd publications constitute a principal part of the stock in trade.""  The statute provides that ""lewd matter"" is synonymous with ""obscene matter"" and defines these terms to mean,  inter alia,  any matter which the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find, when considered as a whole, ""appeals to the prurient interest.""  ""Prurient"" is defined to mean ""that which incites lasciviousness or lust.""  Appellees -- various individuals and corporations who purvey sexually oriented books and movies -- challenged the statute on First Amendment grounds in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  The District Court rejected appellees' constitutional challenges.  The Court of Appeals reversed, invalidating the statute in its entirety on its face on the ground that the definition of ""prurient"" as including ""lust"" was unconstitutionally overbroad in that it reached constitutionally protected material that merely stimulated normal sexual responses. Held: The Court of Appeals erred in facially invalidating the statute in its entirety.  Pp.   472 U. S. 496 -507. (a) These cases are governed by the normal rule that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course.  Unless there are countervailing considerations, the Washington statute should have been invalidated only insofar as the word ""lust"" is to be understood as reaching protected materials.  Pp.   472 U. S. 501 -504. (b) Since prurience may be constitutionally defined for the purposes of identifying obscenity as that which appeals to a shameful or morbid interest in sex,  Roth v. United States,   354 U. S. 476 , if the Washington statute were invalidated only insofar as the word ""lust"" is taken to include normal interest in sex, the statute would pass constitutional muster and would validly reach a whole range of obscene publications.  Moreover, if the Court of Appeals thought that ""lust"" refers  only  to normal   sexual appetites, it could have excised the word from the statute, since the definition also refers to ""lasciviousness.""  Pp.   472 U. S. 504 -505. (c) Even if the statute had not defined prurience at all, there would have been no satisfactory ground for striking it down in its entirety.  The statute itself contains a severability clause, and it is evident that, if the statute were invalidated insofar as it proscribes materials that appeal to normal sexual appetites, the remainder of the statute would retain its effectiveness as a regulation of obscenity.  In these circumstances, the issue of severability is no obstacle to partial invalidation.  Pp.   472 U. S. 506 -507. 725 F.2d 482,  reversed and remanded.

 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Title 18 U.S.C. § 1382 makes it unlawful to reenter a military base after having been ""ordered not to reenter by any officer in command or charge thereof.""  In 1972, respondent received from the commanding officer of Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii a letter (bar letter) forbidding him to reenter the base without written permission from the commanding officer or his designate.  The letter was issued after respondent and a companion entered the base and destroyed Government property.  In 1981, respondent, with some friends, entered Hickam again during the base's annual open house for Armed Forces Day.  Respondent's companions engaged in a peaceful demonstration criticizing the nuclear arms race, but respondent only took photographs of the displays at the open house, and did not disrupt the activities there.  The commanding officer directed the chief of the security police to have the individuals cease their demonstration, and further informed him that he believed one of the individuals involved had been barred from Hickam.  Respondent and his companions were escorted off the base, and respondent was subsequently convicted in Federal District Court of violating § 1382.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had a First Amendment right to enter Hickam during the open house because the base had been transformed into a temporary public forum. Held: 1. Section 1382 applies to respondent's conduct.  Viewed in light of the ordinary meaning of the statutory language, respondent violated § 1382 when he reentered Hickam in 1981.  Moreover, § 1382's legislative history and its purpose of protecting Government property in relation to the national defense support the statute's application to respondent.  There is no merit to respondent's contentions that § 1382 does not allow indefinite exclusion from a military base, but instead applies only to reentry that occurs within some ""reasonable"" period of time after a person's ejection; that § 1382 does not apply when a military base is open to the general public for purposes of attending an open house; and that reentry is unlawful under § 1382 only if a person knows that his conduct violates an extant order not to return, whereas respondent did not subjectively believe that his attendance at the open house was contrary to a valid order barring reentry.  And the assertion that respondent lacked   notice that his reentry was prohibited is implausible, since the bar letter did not indicate that it applied only when public access to Hickam was restricted, and any uncertainty he had in this regard might have been eliminated had he sought, in accord with the bar letter, permission to reenter from the commanding officer.  Pp.   472 U. S. 679 -684. 2. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the First Amendment bars respondent's conviction for violating § 1382 by his reentry during the open house.   Flower v. United States,   407 U. S. 197 , distinguished.  A military base generally is not a public forum, and Hickam did not become a public forum merely because the base was used to communicate ideas or information during the open house.  Moreover, regardless of whether Hickam constituted a public forum on the day of the open house, respondent's exclusion did not violate the First Amendment.  The fact that respondent had previously received a valid bar letter distinguished him from the general public and provided a reasonable ground for excluding him from the base.  Nor does the general exclusion of recipients of bar letters from military open houses violate the First Amendment on the asserted ground that such exclusion is greater than is essential to the furtherance of Government interests in the security of military installations.  Exclusion of holders of bar letters in such circumstances promotes an important Government interest in assuring the security of military installations.  Nothing in the First Amendment requires military commanders to wait until persons subject to a valid bar order have entered a military base to see if they will conduct themselves properly during an open house.  Pp.   472 U. S. 684 -690. 3. Since the Court of Appeals did not address whether, on the facts of this case, application of the 1972 bar letter to respondent was so patently arbitrary as to violate due process, this Court does not decide that issue.  P.   472 U. S. 690 . 710 F.2d 1410,  reversed and remanded. O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and WHITE, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.

 Syllabus   Petitioner credit reporting agency sent a report to five subscribers indicating that respondent construction contractor had filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.  The report was false, and grossly misrepresented respondent's assets and liabilities.  Thereafter, petitioner issued a corrective notice, but respondent was dissatisfied with this notice and brought a defamation action in Vermont state court, alleging that the false report had injured its reputation and seeking damages.  After trial, the jury returned a verdict in respondent's favor and awarded both compensatory or presumed damages and punitive damages.  But the trial court believed that  Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,   418 U. S. 323 , controlled, and granted petitioner's motion for a new trial on the ground that the instructions to the jury permitted it to award damages on a lesser showing than ""actual malice.""  The Vermont Supreme Court reversed, holding that  Gertz  was inapplicable to nonmedia defamation actions. Held:   The judgment is affirmed. 143 Vt. 66,  461 A.2d 414 ,  affirmed."

 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   By Executive Order, participation in the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), a charity drive aimed at federal employees, is limited to voluntary, tax-exempt, nonprofit charitable agencies that provide direct health and welfare services to individuals or their families, and legal defense and political advocacy organizations are specifically excluded.  Participating organizations confine their fundraising activities to a 30-word statement submitted for inclusion in the CFC literature disseminated to federal employees.  Undesignated contributions are distributed on a local level to certain participating organizations, and designated funds are paid directly to the specified recipient.  Respondent legal defense and political advocacy organizations brought an action in Federal District Court challenging their exclusion under the Executive Order on the grounds,  inter alia,  that the denial of the right to seek designated funds violated their First Amendment right to solicit charitable contributions.  The District Court granted summary judgment in respondents' favor and enjoined the denial of their pending or future applications to participate in the solicitation of designated contributions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the Government restrictions in question were not reasonable. Held: 1. Solicitation in the context of the CFC is speech protected by the First Amendment.  The brief statements in the CFC literature directly advance the speaker's interest in informing readers about its existence and goals.  Moreover, an employee's contribution in response to a request for funds functions as a general expression of support for the recipient and its views.  Although the CFC does not entail direct discourse between the solicitor and the donor, the CFC literature facilitates the dissemination of views and ideas by directing employees to the soliciting agency to obtain more extensive information.  And without the funds obtained from solicitation in various fora, the soliciting organization's continuing ability to communicate ideas and goals may be jeopardized.  Pp.   473 U. S. 797 -799. 2. The CFC, rather than the federal workplace, is the relevant forum.  Although, as an initial matter, a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property devoted to public use to evoke First Amendment   concerns, forum analysis is not completed merely by identifying the Government property at issue.  Rather, in defining the forum, the focus should be on the access sought by the speaker.  Here, respondents seek access to a particular means of communication, the CFC.  And the CFC is a nonpublic forum.  This conclusion is supported both by the Government's policy in creating the CFC to minimize the disturbance of federal employees while on duty formerly resulting from unlimited  ad hoc  solicitation activities and by the Government's practice of limiting access to the CFC to those organizations considered appropriate.  Pp.   473 U. S. 799 -806. 3. The Government's reasons for excluding respondents from the CFC appear, at least facially, to satisfy the reasonableness standard.  The Government's decision to restrict access to a nonpublic forum need only be reasonable, and the reasonableness must be assessed in the light of the purpose of the forum and all surrounding circumstances.  Here, the President could reasonably conclude that a dollar directly spent on providing food and shelter to the needy is more beneficial than a dollar spent on litigation that might or might not result in aid to the needy.  Moreover, avoiding the appearance of political favoritism is a valid justification for limiting speech in a nonpublic forum.  Respondents' tax-exempt status does not determine the reasonableness of the Government's excluding them from the CFC.  And the record supports an inference that respondents' participation in the CFC would be detrimental to the CFC and disruptive of the federal workplace.  The First Amendment does not forbid a viewpoint-neutral exclusion of speakers who would disrupt a nonpublic forum and hinder its effectiveness for its intended purpose.  Pp.   473 U. S. 806 -811. 4. Where the issue whether the Government impermissibly excluded respondents from the CFC because it disagreed with their viewpoints was neither decided below nor fully briefed before this Court, the issue will not be decided by this Court in the first instance, but respondents are free to pursue the issue on remand.  Pp.   473 U. S. 811 -813. 234 U.S.App.D.C. 148, 727 F.2d 1247, reversed and remanded. O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and WHITE and REHNQUIST JJ., joined.

 Syllabus   Petitioner, suffering from a progressive eye condition, applied to the Washington Commission for the Blind for vocational rehabilitation assistance pursuant to a Washington statute.  At the time, he was attending a private Christian college seeking to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.  The Commission denied aid on the ground that it was prohibited by the State Constitution, and this ruling was upheld on administrative appeal.  Petitioner then brought an action in State Superior Court, which affirmed the administrative ruling on the same state law grounds.  The Washington Supreme Court affirmed but based its ruling on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, holding that the provision of aid to petitioner would have the primary effect of advancing religion in violation of that Clause. Held:   On the record, extension of aid under the Washington vocational rehabilitation program to finance petitioner's training at the Christian college would not advance religion in a manner inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.  Pp.   474 U. S. 485 -490. (a) As far as the record shows, assistance provided under the Washington program is paid directly to the student, who then transmits it to the educational institution of his or her choice.  The program is in no way skewed towards religion, and creates no financial incentive for students who undertake sectarian education.  Pp.   474 U. S. 487 -488. (b) Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that, if petitioner succeeds, any significant portion of the aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education.  P.   474 U. S. 488 . (c) On the facts, it is inappropriate to view any aid ultimately flowing to the Christian college as resulting from a state action sponsoring or subsidizing religion.  Nor does the mere circumstance that petitioner has chosen to use neutrally available state aid to help pay for his religious education confer any message of state endorsement of religion.

 Syllabus   Appellant Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has distributed a newsletter in its monthly billing statements for many years.  The newsletter has included political editorials, feature stories on matters of public interest, tips on energy conservation, and information about utility services and bills.  Appellee Toward Utility Rate Normalization (TURN), in a ratemaking proceeding before appellee California Public Utilities Commission (Commission), urged the Commission to forbid appellant to use billing envelopes to distribute political editorials, on the ground that appellant's customers should not bear the expense of appellant's own political speech.  The Commission decided that the envelope space that appellant had used to disseminate the newsletter was the ratepayers' property, defining this ""extra space"" as the space left over after including the bill and required notices.  In an effort to apportion this ""extra space"" between appellant and its customers, the Commission permitted TURN to use the ""extra space"" four times a year to raise funds and to communicate with ratepayers with no limitation except to state that its messages were not those of appellant.  Arguing that it had a First Amendment right not to help spread a message with which it disagrees, appellant appealed the Commission's order to the California Supreme Court, which denied discretionary review. Held:   The Commission's decision must be vacated. Remanded."

No. 84-1360 Argued November 12, 1985 Decided February 25, 1986 475 U.S. 41 APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondents purchased two theaters in Renton, Washington, with the intention of exhibiting adult films and, at about the same time, filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that the First and Fourteenth Amendments were violated by a city ordinance that prohibits adult motion picture theaters from locating within 1,000 feet of any residential zone, single- or multiple-family dwelling, church, park, or school.  The District Court ultimately entered summary judgment in the city's favor, holding that the ordinance did not violate the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the ordinance constituted a substantial restriction on First Amendment interests, and remanded the case for reconsideration as to whether the city had substantial governmental interests to support the ordinance. Held:   The ordinance is a valid governmental response to the serious problems created by adult theaters and satisfies the dictates of the First Amendment.   Cf. Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc.,   427 U. S. 50 .  Pp.   475 U. S. 46 -55. (a) Since the ordinance does not ban adult theaters altogether, it is properly analyzed as a form of time, place, and manner regulation.  ""Content-neutral"" time, place, and manner regulations are acceptable so long as they are designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.  Pp.   475 U. S. 46 -47. (b) The District Court found that the Renton City Council's ""predominate"" concerns were with the secondary effects of adult theaters on the surrounding community, not with the content of adult films themselves.  This finding is more than adequate to establish that the city's pursuit of its zoning interests was unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and thus the ordinance is a ""content-neutral"" speech regulation.  Pp.   475 U. S. 47 -50. (c) The Renton ordinance is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest while allowing for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.  A city's interest in attempting to preserve the quality of urban life, as here, must be accorded high respect.  Although the ordinance was enacted without the benefit of studies specifically relating to   Renton's particular problems, Renton was entitled to rely on the experiences of, and studies produced by, the nearby city of Seattle and other cities.  Nor was there any constitutional defect in the method chosen by Renton to further its substantial interests.  Cities may regulate adult theaters by dispersing them, or by effectively concentrating them, as in Renton.  Moreover, the ordinance is not ""underinclusive"" for failing to regulate other kinds of adult businesses, since there was no evidence that, at the time the ordinance was enacted, any other adult business was located in, or was contemplating moving into, Renton.  Pp. 50-53. (d) As required by the First Amendment, the ordinance allows for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.  Although respondents argue that, in general, there are no ""commercially viable"" adult theater sites within the limited area of land left open for such theaters by the ordinance, the fact that respondents must fend for themselves in the real estate market, on an equal footing with other prospective purchasers and lessees, does not give rise to a violation of the First Amendment, which does not compel the Government to ensure that adult theaters, or any other kinds of speech-related businesses, will be able to obtain sites at bargain prices.

 THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   When a group of high school students in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, formed a club for the purpose of promoting ""spiritual growth and positive attitudes in the lives of its members,"" they asked the Principal for permission to hold club meetings on the school premises during student activity periods.  The matter was referred to the School Superintendent, who denied permission on the basis of an opinion of the School District Solicitor, and the School Board upheld the denial.  The students then filed suit in Federal District Court against the School District, members of the School Board, the Superintendent, and the Principal, alleging that the refusal to allow the club to meet on the same basis as other student groups because of its religious activities violated the First Amendment, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court, on motions for summary judgment, ruled in the students' favor, but entered no injunction and granted no relief against any defendant in his individual capacity.  The School District took no appeal, but complied with the judgment and allowed the students' club to conduct the meetings as requested.  However, respondent Youngman (hereafter respondent), who was then still a member of the School Board, did appeal.  No one raised any question about his standing to appeal, and the Court of Appeals held in his favor. Held:   Respondent had no standing to appeal, and therefore the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to hear his appeal.  Pp.   475 U. S. 541 -549. (a) Federal courts have only the power that is authorized by Article III of the Constitution and the federal statutes enacted pursuant thereto.  Every federal appellate court must satisfy itself that the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has a sufficient stake in the outcome of the litigation to support that jurisdiction.  Pp.   475 U. S. 541 -543. (b) Respondent had no standing to appeal in his individual capacity.  Although the complaint alleged that the action was brought against the defendants ""in their individual and official capacities,"" there is nothing else in the complaint or in the record to support the suggestion that relief was sought or awarded against any School Board member in his individual capacity.  P.   475 U. S. 543 . (c) As a member of the School Board sued in his official capacity, respondent had no personal stake in the outcome of the litigation, and   therefore had no standing to appeal in that capacity.  His status as a Board member did not permit him to ""step into the shoes of the Board"" and invoke its right to appeal.  Pp.   475 U. S. 543 -545. (d) Nor did respondent have standing to appeal in his capacity as a parent of a student attending the high school.  There is nothing in the record to indicate anything about his status as a parent, or to indicate that he or his children have suffered any injury as a result of the District Court's judgment or of the activities of the club in question subsequent to the entry of that judgment.  Respondent was not sued as a parent, and thus was plainly not a ""party"" in that capacity in the District Court.  Pp.   475 U. S. 545 -549. 741 F.2d 538, vacated and remanded.

Hepps No. 84-1491 Argued December 3, 1985 Decided April 21, 1986 475 U.S. 767 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA
 Syllabus   Appellee Hepps is the principal stockholder of appellee corporation that franchises a chain of stores selling beer, soft drinks, and snacks.  Appellant owner published a series of articles in its Philadelphia newspaper whose general theme was that Hepps, the franchisor corporation, and its franchisees (also appellees) had links to organized crime and used some of those links to influence the State's governmental processes.  Appellees then brought a defamation suit in a Pennsylvania state court against the newspaper owner and the authors (also appellants) of the articles in question.  Concluding that the Pennsylvania statute giving the defendant the burden of proving the truth of allegedly defamatory statements violated the Federal Constitution, the trial court instructed the jury that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving falsity.  The jury ruled for appellants, and therefore awarded no damages to appellees.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, concluding that a showing of fault did not require a showing of falsity, held that to place the burden of showing truth on the defendant did not unconstitutionally inhibit free debate, and remanded the case for a new trial. Held:   In a case such as this one, where a newspaper publishes speech of public concern about a private figure, the private-figure plaintiff cannot recover damages without also showing that the statements at issue are false.  Because in such a case the scales are in an uncertain balance as to whether the statements are true or false, the Constitution requires that the scales be tipped in favor of protecting true speech.  To ensure that true speech on matters of public concern is not deterred, the common law presumption that defamatory speech is false cannot stand.  While Pennsylvania's ""shield law,"" which allows employees of the media to refuse to divulge their sources, places a heavier burden on appellees, the precise scope of that law is unclear and, under these circumstances, it does not appear that such law requires a different constitutional standard than would prevail in the absence of such law.

 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent sued petitioners, the city of Los Angeles and its Department of Water and Power (DWP), in Federal District Court, alleging,  inter alia,  a violation of its rights under the First Amendment by reason of (1) the city's refusal to grant respondent a cable television franchise on the ground that respondent had failed to participate in an auction for a single franchise in the area and (2) DWP's refusal to grant access to poles or underground conduits used for power lines.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Held:   The complaint should not have been dismissed.  The activities in which respondent allegedly seeks to engage plainly implicate First Amendment interests.  Through original programming or by exercising editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include in its repertoire, respondent seeks to communicate messages on a wide variety of topics and in a wide variety of formats.  But where speech and conduct are joined in a single course of action, the First Amendment values must be balanced against competing societal interests.  Thus, where the city has made factual assertions to justify restrictions on cable television franchising and these assertions are disputed by respondent, there must be a fuller development of the disputed factual issues before this Court will decide the legal issues.  Accordingly, the case will be remanded to the District Court so that petitioners may file an answer and the material factual disputes may be resolved.  Pp.   476 U.

Thereafter, the State, supported by petitioner and opposed by the defendant, moved unsuccessfully in the California Superior Court to have the transcript released.  Petitioner then filed a peremptory writ of mandate with the California Court of Appeal.  Meanwhile, the defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and the Superior Court released the transcript.  After holding that the controversy was not moot, the Court of Appeal denied the writ.  The California Supreme Court also denied the writ, holding that there is no general First Amendment right of access to preliminary hearings, and that. under the California statute, if the defendant establishes a ""reasonable likelihood of substantial prejudice,"" the burden shifts to the prosecution or the media to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no such reasonable probability of prejudice.  Held: 1. Even though the Superior Court ultimately released the transcript in question, the case is not moot, because the controversy is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review.""   Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court,   457 U. S. 596 ;  Gannett Co. v. DePasquale,   443 U. S. 368 .  Thus, this Court has jurisdiction.  P.   478 U. S. 6 . 2. The qualified First Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings applies to preliminary hearings as conducted in California.   First, there has been a tradition of public accessibility to preliminary hearings of the type conducted in California.  As opposed to grand jury proceedings, preliminary hearings conducted before neutral and detached magistrates have been open to the public.  Second, public access to such preliminary hearings is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.  This proper functioning is not made any less essential by the fact that a preliminary hearing cannot result in a conviction and the adjudication is before a magistrate without a jury.  The absence of a jury makes the importance of public access even more significant.  Pp.   478 U. S. 6 -13. 3. Since a qualified First Amendment right of access attaches to preliminary hearings as conducted in California, the proceedings cannot be closed unless specific, on-the-record findings are made demonstrating that ""closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.""   Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court,   464 U. S. 501 ,   464 U. S. 510 .  If the interest asserted is the defendant's right to a fair trial, the preliminary hearing shall not be closed unless there is a ""substantial probability"" that that right will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent, and that reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the right.  Here, the ""reasonable likelihood"" test applied by the California Supreme Court placed a lesser burden on the defendant than the ""substantial probability"" test required by the First Amendment.  Moreover, the court failed to consider whether alternatives short of closure would have protected the defendant's interests.  Pp.   478 U. S. 13 -15. 37 Cal. 3d 773,  691 P.2d 1026 , reversed.

Tourism Company of Puerto Rico No. 84-1903 Argued April 28, 1986 Decided July 1, 1986 478 U.S. 328 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PUERTO RICO
 Syllabus   Puerto Rico's Games of Chance Act of 1948 (Act) legalizes certain forms of casino gambling in licensed places in order to promote the development of tourism, but also provides that ""[n]o gambling room shall be permitted to advertise or otherwise offer their facilities to the public of Puerto Rico.""  Implementing regulations prohibit the advertising of gambling parlors to the public in Puerto Rico, but permit restricted advertising through publicity media outside Puerto Rico.  Appellant, a partnership franchised to operate a casino in Puerto Rico, was fined by appellee public corporation, which is authorized to administer the Act, for violating the advertising restrictions in the Act and the regulations.  Appellant then filed suit against appellee in the Puerto Rico Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act and regulations, both facially and as applied by appellee, impermissibly suppressed commercial speech in violation of the First Amendment and the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Federal Constitution.  The court held that the advertising restrictions had been unconstitutionally applied to appellant's past conduct, but the court then adopted a narrowing construction of the Act and regulations, declaring that they prohibited local advertising addressed to inviting residents of Puerto Rico to visit casinos, but not certain local advertising addressed to tourists, even though it might incidentally reach the attention of residents.  The court then held that, based on its construction of the laws, the statute and regulations were facially constitutional.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court dismissed appellant's appeal on the ground that it ""d[id] not present a substantial constitutional question."" Held: 1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1258(2), which authorizes an appeal to this Court from a decision of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court that is in favor of the validity of a Puerto Rico statute challenged as being repugnant to the Federal Constitution.  Appellant's federal constitutional claims were adequately raised at every stage of the proceedings below, and under Puerto Rico law appellant had the right to appeal the Superior Court's decision to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court on the   ground that the case involved or decided a substantial constitutional question under the Federal Constitution.  Thus, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's dismissal of the appeal for want of a substantial constitutional question constituted a decision on the merits in favor of the validity of the challenged statute and regulations.  This Court's jurisdiction is not affected by appellant's late filing, under Puerto Rico's Rules of Civil Procedure, of its notice of appeal to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, since that court has held the filing requirement to be nonjurisdictional, and its failure to dismiss on timeliness grounds must be viewed as a waiver of the requirement.  Pp.   478 U. S. 337 -339. 2. In reviewing the facial constitutionality of the Act and regulations, this Court must abide by the narrowing constructions announced by the Superior Court and approved  sub silentio  by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.  This would be the rule in a case originating in one of the 50 States, and Puerto Rico's status as a Commonwealth dictates application of the same rule.  P.   478 U. S. 339 . 3. The Act and regulations, as construed by the Superior Court, do not facially violate the First Amendment.  The advertising restrictions   pass muster under the four-pronged test of  Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York,   447 U. S. 557 .  First, the particular kind of commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity, and is not misleading or fraudulent, at least in the abstract, and thus is entitled to a limited form of First Amendment protection.  Second, Puerto Rico's interest in restricting advertising to reduce the demand for casino gambling by Puerto Rico's residents, and thus protect their health, safety, and welfare, constitutes a ""substantial"" governmental interest.  Third, the restrictions on commercial speech ""directly advance"" the government's asserted interest, and are not under-inclusive simply because other kinds of gambling may be advertised to Puerto Rico residents.  And fourth, the restrictions are no more extensive than necessary to serve the government's interest since, as construed by the Superior Court, they do not affect advertising aimed at tourists, but apply only to advertising aimed at Puerto Rico residents.    Carey v. Population Services International,   431 U. S. 678 , and  Bigelow v. Virginia,   421 U. S. 809 , distinguished.  There is no merit to appellant's argument that, having chosen to legalize casino gambling for Puerto Rico residents, the legislature is prohibited by the First Amendment from using restrictions on advertising to accomplish its goal of reducing demand for such gambling.  Pp.   478 U. S. 340 -347. 4. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court properly concluded that, as construed by the Superior Court, the Act and regulations do not facially violate the due process or equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.  Even assuming that appellant's argument that the advertising restrictions are unconstitutionally vague, in violation of due process requirements, has merit with respect to the bare statutory language, nevertheless this Court is bound by the Superior Court's narrowing construction of the statute.  Viewed in that light, and particularly with the interpretive assistance of the regulations as modified by the Superior Court, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  Pp.   478 U. S. 347 -348.

 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent public high school student (hereafter respondent) delivered a speech nominating a fellow student for a student elective office at a voluntary assembly that was held during school hours as part of a school-sponsored educational program in self-government, and that was attended by approximately 600 students, many of whom were 14-year-olds.  During the entire speech, respondent referred to his candidate in terms of an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor.  Some of the students at the assembly hooted and yelled during the speech, some mimicked the sexual activities alluded to in the speech, and others appeared to be bewildered and embarrassed.  Prior to delivering the speech, respondent discussed it with several teachers, two of whom advised him that it was inappropriate and should not be given.  The morning after the assembly, the Assistant Principal called respondent into her office and notified him that the school considered his speech to have been a violation of the school's ""disruptive conduct rule,"" which prohibited conduct that substantially interfered with the educational process, including the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.  Respondent was given copies of teacher reports of his conduct, and was given a chance to explain his conduct.  After he admitted that he deliberately used sexual innuendo in the speech, he was informed that he would be suspended for three days, and that his name would be removed from the list of candidates for graduation speaker at the school's commencement exercises.  Review of the disciplinary action through petitioner School District's grievance procedures resulted in affirmance of the discipline, but respondent was allowed to return to school after serving only two days of his suspension.  Respondent, by his father (also a respondent) as guardian  ad litem,  then filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech and seeking injunctive relief and damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The court held that the school's sanctions violated the First Amendment, that the school's disruptive conduct rule was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that the removal of respondent's name from the graduation speaker's list violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court awarded respondent monetary relief and enjoined the   School District from preventing him from speaking at the commencement ceremonies.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. The First Amendment did not prevent the School District from disciplining respondent for giving the offensively lewd and indecent speech at the assembly.   Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.,   393 U. S. 503 , distinguished.  Under the First Amendment, the use of an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to adults making what the speaker considers a political point, but it does not follow that the same latitude must be permitted to children in a public school.  It is a highly appropriate function of public school education to prohibit the use of vulgar and offensive terms in public discourse.  Nothing in the Constitution prohibits the states from insisting that certain modes of expression are inappropriate and subject to sanctions.  The inculcation of these values is truly the work of the school, and the determination of what manner of speech is inappropriate properly rests with the school board.  First Amendment jurisprudence recognizes an interest in protecting minors from exposure to vulgar and offensive spoken language,  FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,   438 U. S. 726 , as well as limitations on the otherwise absolute interest of the speaker in reaching an unlimited audience where the speech is sexually explicit and the audience may include children.   Ginsberg v. New York,   390 U. S. 629 .  Petitioner School District acted entirely within its permissible authority in imposing sanctions upon respondent in response to his offensively lewd and indecent speech, which had no claim to First Amendment protection.  Pp.   478 U. S. 680 -686. 2. There is no merit to respondent's contention that the circumstances of his suspension violated due process because he had no way of knowing that the delivery of the speech would subject him to disciplinary sanctions.  Given the school's need to be able to impose disciplinary sanctions for a wide range of unanticipated conduct disruptive of the educational process, the school disciplinary rules need not be as detailed as a criminal code which imposes criminal sanctions.  The school disciplinary rule proscribing ""obscene"" language and the prespeech admonitions of teachers gave adequate warning to respondent that his lewd speech could subject him to sanctions.

 Syllabus   A New York statute authorizes closure of a building found to be a public health nuisance because it was being used as a place for prostitution and lewdness.  After a county Deputy Sheriff's undercover investigation of respondents' ""adult"" bookstore disclosed that illicit sexual activities, including solicitation of prostitution, occurred on the premises, a civil complaint was filed against respondents seeking closure of the premises under the statute.  Respondents answered by alleging,  inter alia,  that a closure would impermissibly interfere with their First Amendment right to sell books on the premises, and that the closure statute was not intended to apply to establishments other than houses of prostitution.  The New York trial court denied respondents' motion for a summary judgment, holding that the statute applied to respondents.  The Appellate Division affirmed.  The New York Court of Appeals reversed on First Amendment grounds.  Applying the test of  United States v. O'Brien,   391 U. S. 367 , for determining the validity of a statute regulating conduct that has an expressive element, the court held that the closure statute failed the part of the  O'Brien  test that requires the statute to be no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose, because the closure order was much broader than necessary to achieve the restriction against illicit sexual activities and because an injunction against continuing those activities could achieve the same effect without restricting respondents' bookselling activities. Held:   The First Amendment does not bar enforcement of the closure statute against respondents' bookstore.   United States v. O'Brien, supra,  has no relevance to a statute directed at imposing sanctions on nonexpressive activity, and the sexual activities carried on in this case manifest absolutely no element of protected expression.  The closure statute is directed at unlawful conduct having nothing to do with books or other expressive activity.  Bookselling on premises used for prostitution does not confer First Amendment coverage to defeat a statute aimed at penalizing and terminating illegal uses of premises.  Pp.   478 U.

 STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The City Commission of Newport, Ky., enacted an ordinance prohibiting nude or nearly nude dancing in local establishments licensed to sell   liquor for consumption on the premises.  Respondents, proprietors of Newport liquor establishments that offered nude or nearly nude entertainment, filed an action in Federal District Court contending that the ordinance deprived them of their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional under the doctrine of  New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca,   452 U. S. 714 , which upheld a state law imposing an almost identical prohibition on nude dancing as being within the State's broad power under the Twenty-first Amendment to regulate the sale of liquor within its boundaries.  The Court of Appeals reversed. Held: The ordinance is constitutional.  This case is controlled by  Bellanca.   The States' broad regulatory authority conferred by the Twenty-first Amendment in the context of liquor licensing includes the power to ban nude dancing and outweighs any First Amendment interest in nude dancing.  The Court of Appeals misperceived this broad base for the  Bellanca  decision by concluding that because, under the Kentucky Constitution, a city cannot ban the sale of alcohol without approval by local election, it similarly cannot regulate nude dancing in bars.  Generally, States may delegate their power under the Twenty-first Amendment as they see fit, and the fact that Kentucky has delegated one portion of its power to the electorate -- the power to decide if liquor may be served in local establishments -- does not differentiate this case from  Bellanca. Certiorari granted; 786 F.2d 1364, reversed and remanded. PER CURIAM. In 1982, the City Commission of Newport, Ky., enacted Ordinance No. 0-82-85.  This ordinance prohibited nude or nearly nude dancing in local establishments licensed to sell liquor for consumption on the premises. [ Footnote 1 ]  A state law imposing an almost identical prohibition on nude dancing was upheld by this Court in  New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca,   452 U. S. 714  (1981) (per curiam), as being within the State's broad power under the Twenty-first Amendment [ Footnote 2 ] to regulate the sale of liquor within its boundaries. Respondents, proprietors of Newport liquor establishments that offered nude or nearly nude entertainment, challenged the ordinance in federal court.  They contended that the ordinance deprived them of their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and they sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against its enforcement. [ Footnote 3 ]  The District Court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional, stating that it ""is squarely within the doctrine   of  Bellanca  . . . and must be upheld on that basis."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a. A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed that judgment.  785 F.2d 1354 (1986).  It found the decision in  Bellanca  inapplicable because, in Kentucky, local voters, rather than the city or the Commonwealth, determine whether alcohol may be sold.  Pursuant to the authority granted by the Commonwealth's Constitution, [ Footnote 4 ] Kentucky expressly authorizes a city to conduct a popular election on a question of local prohibition when a specified proportion of qualified voters petition for such an election.   See  Ky. Rev. Stat. §§242.010-242.990 (1981 and Supp. 1986).  Noting this Court's statement in  Bellanca  that ""[t]he State's power to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages entirely includes the lesser power to ban the sale of liquor on premises where topless dancing occurs,"" 452 U.S. at   452 U. S. 717 , the Court of Appeals' majority nevertheless concluded that the ordinance could not be justified under the broad authority bestowed by the Twenty-first Amendment.  It stated that this case does not fall within the  Bellanca  ""doctrine"" or ""rationale"" because the city ""cannot exercise in part a power it does not hold in full.""  785 F.2d  at 1358.  The court remanded the case for a determination, among other things, of the city's authority to enact the ordinance under its police power.  The dissenting judge argued that the majority read  Bellanca  too narrowly, and he contended that the city is not restricted solely to the exercise of the police power to regulate the liquor industry. We agree with the dissent's conclusion that this case is controlled by  Bellanca,  and we therefore reverse.  The reach of   the Twenty-first Amendment is certainly not without limit, [ Footnote 5 ] but previous decisions of this Court have established that, in the context of liquor licensing, the Amendment confers broad regulatory powers on the States. ""While the States, vested as they are with general police power, require no specific grant of authority in the Federal Constitution to legislate with respect to matters traditionally within the scope of the police power, the broad sweep of the Twenty-first Amendment has been recognized as conferring something more than the normal state authority over public health, welfare, and morals."" California v. LaRue,   409 U. S. 109 ,   409 U. S. 114  (1972).  This regulatory authority includes the power to ban nude dancing as part of a liquor license control program. ""In  LaRue,  . . . we concluded that the broad powers of the States to regulate the sale of liquor, conferred by the Twenty-first Amendment, outweighed any First Amendment interest in nude dancing, and that a State could therefore ban such dancing as a part of its liquor license program."" Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc.,   422 U. S. 922 ,   422 U. S. 932 -933 (1975).  In  Bellanca,  the Court upheld a state statute imposing just such a ban. The Court of Appeals misperceived this broad base for the ruling in  Bellanca  and seized upon a single sentence, characterizing it as the ""doctrine"" or ""rationale"" of  Bellanca . Because a Kentucky city cannot ban the sale of alcohol without election approval, the court concluded that it similarly cannot   regulate nude dancing in bars.  In holding that a State ""has broad power . . . to regulate the times, places, and circumstances under which liquor may be sold,""  Bellanca,  452 U.S. at   452 U. S. 715 , this Court has never attached any constitutional significance to a State's division of its authority over alcohol.  The Twenty-first Amendment has given broad power to the States, and generally they may delegate this power as they see fit. [ Footnote 6 ] There is certainly no constitutional requirement that the same governmental unit must grant liquor licenses, revoke licenses, and regulate the circumstances under which liquor may be sold.  Indeed, while Kentucky provides that the question of local prohibition is to be decided by popular election, the parties are in agreement that the city is vested with the power to revoke a liquor license upon a finding of a violation of state law, a state liquor regulation, or a city ordinance.   See  Brief in Opposition 7.  Yet the rationale of the opinion of the Court of Appeals implies that, because of the Kentucky Constitution, neither the State nor the city may revoke a liquor license under the authority of the Twenty-first Amendment.  Only a strained reading of  Bellanca  would require each licensing decision to be made by plebiscite.  Moreover, there is no statutory provision that gives the voters direct authority, once the sale of alcohol is permitted, to determine the manner of regulation.  Thus, if respondents were to prevail in their argument that only voters can ban nudity because only voters have the authority to ban the sale of alcohol, it is possible that nude dancing in bars would be immune from any regulation. The Newport City Commission, in the preamble to the ordinance, determined that nude dancing in establishments serving liquor was ""injurious to the citizens"" of the city.  It found the ordinance necessary to a range of purposes, including ""prevent[ing] blight and the deterioration of the City's neighborhoods""   and ""decreas[ing] the incidence of crime, disorderly conduct and juvenile delinquency.""   See  785 F.2d  at 1360.  ""Given the added presumption in favor of the validity of the . . . regulation in this area that the Twenty-first Amendment requires,""  California v. LaRue,  409 U.S. at   409 U. S. 118 -119, it is plain that, as in  Bellanca,  the interest in maintaining order outweighs the interest in free expression by dancing nude.  The fact that the Commonwealth of Kentucky has delegated one portion of its power under the Twenty-first Amendment to the electorate -- the power to decide if liquor may be served in local establishments -- does not differentiate this case from  Bellanca. The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered."

 THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Section 316 of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits corporations from using treasury funds to make an expenditure ""in connection with"" any federal election, and requires that any expenditure for such purpose be financed by voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund.  Appellee is a nonprofit, nonstock corporation, whose purpose is to foster respect for human life and to defend the right to life of all human beings, born and unborn, through educational, political, and other forms of activities.  To further this purpose, it has published a newsletter that has been distributed to contributors and to noncontributors who have expressed support for the organization.  In September, 1978, appellee prepared and distributed a ""Special Edition"" exhorting readers to vote ""pro-life"" in the upcoming primary elections in Massachusetts, listing the candidates for each state and federal office in every voting district in the State, and identifying each one as either supporting or opposing appellee's views.  While some 400 candidates were listed, the photographs of only 13 were featured, all of whom were identified as favoring appellee's views.  The publication was prepared by a staff that had prepared no regular newsletter, was distributed to a much larger audience than that of the regular newsletter, most of whom were members of the general public, and was financed by money taken from appellee's general treasury funds.  A complaint was filed with appellant Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that the ""Special Edition"" violated § 316 as representing an expenditure of funds from a corporate treasury to distribute to the general public a campaign flyer on behalf of certain political candidates.  After the FEC determined that there was probable cause to believe that appellee had violated the statute, the FEC filed a complaint in Federal District Court, seeking a civil penalty and other relief.  The District Court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, holding that § 316 did not apply to appellee, but that, if it did it, was unconstitutional as a violation of the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals held that the statute applied to appellee and, as so applied, was unconstitutional.  Held:  The judgment is affirmed. 769 F.2d 13, affirmed."

 Syllabus   Arkansas imposes a tax on receipts from sales of tangible personal property, but exempts numerous items, including newspapers and ""religious, professional, trade, and sports journals and/or publications printed and published within this State"" (magazine exemption).  Appellant publishes in Arkansas a general interest magazine that includes articles on a variety of subjects, including religion and sports.  In 1984, relying on  Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue,   460 U. S. 575 , appellant sought a refund of sales tax it had paid since 1982, asserting that the magazine exemption must be construed to include its magazine, and that subjecting its magazine to the sales tax, while sales of newspapers and other magazines were exempt, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  After appellee denied the refund claim, appellant sought review in State Chancery Court, stating an additional claim under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 for injunctive relief and attorney's fees.  That court granted appellant summary judgment, construing the magazine exemption to include appellant because its magazine was published and printed in Arkansas.  The Arkansas Supreme Court reversed, holding that the magazine exemption applies only to religious, professional, trade, or sports periodicals.  The court rejected the claim that the exemption granted to other publications discriminated against appellant, ruling that success on this claim would avail appellant nothing, since it would still be subject to tax even if the exemption fell.  The court also refused to find that appellant's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated, ruling that the sales tax was a permissible ""ordinary form of taxation"" to which publishers are not immune.  Accordingly, the court did not consider appellant's attorney's fees claim. Held: 1. Appellant has standing to challenge the Arkansas sales tax scheme.  Appellee's argument that appellant has not asserted an injury that this Court can redress, since appellant concededly publishes neither a newspaper nor a religious, professional, trade, or sports journal, is unpersuasive, since it would effectively insulate underinclusive statutes from constitutional challenge.  Appellant has alleged a sufficient personal stake in this litigation's outcome, in that the State Supreme Court's holding stands as a total bar to appellant's relief, and its constitutional attack   holds the only promise of escape from the burden imposed upon it by the challenged statute.  P.   481 U. S. 227 . 2. The Arkansas sales tax scheme that taxes general interest magazines, but exempts newspapers and religious, professional, trade, and sports journals, violates the First Amendment's freedom of the press guarantee.  Pp.   481 U. S. 227 -234. (a) Even though there is no evidence of an improper censorial motive, the Arkansas tax burdens rights protected by the First Amendment by discriminating against a small group of magazines, including appellant's, which are the only magazines that pay the tax.  Such selective taxation is one of the types of discrimination identified in  Minneapolis Star.   Indeed, its use here is even more disturbing than in that case, because the Arkansas statute requires official scrutiny of publications' content as the basis for imposing a tax.  This is incompatible with the First Amendment, whose requirements are not avoided merely because the statute does not burden the expression of particular views expressed by specific magazines, and exempts other members of the media that might publish discussions of the various subjects contained in appellant's magazine.  Pp.   481 U. S. 227 -231. (b) Appellee has not satisfied its heavy burden of showing that its discriminatory tax scheme is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.  The State's general interest in raising revenue does not justify selective imposition of the sales tax on some magazines and not others, based solely on their content, since revenues could be raised simply by taxing businesses generally.  Furthermore, appellee's assertion that the magazine exemption serves the state interest of encouraging ""fledgling"" publishers is not persuasive, since the exemption is not narrowly tailored to achieve that end.  To the contrary, the exemption is both overinclusive and underinclusive in that it exempts the enumerated types of magazines regardless of whether they are ""fledgling"" or are lucrative and well established, while making general interest magazines and struggling specialty magazines on other subjects ineligible for favorable tax treatment.  Moreover, although the asserted state need to ""foster communication"" might support a blanket exemption of the press from the sales tax, it cannot justify selective taxation of certain publishers.  Pp.   481 U. S. 231 -232. 3. Since the state courts have not yet indicated whether they will exercise jurisdiction over appellant's claims under §§ 1983 and 1988, this Court remands to give them an opportunity to do so.  Pp.   481 U.S. 233 -234. 287 Ark. 155, 697 S.W.2d 94 and  698 S.W.2d 802 , reversed and remanded.

 EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   The Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 (Act) requires registration, reporting, and disclosure by persons engaging in propaganda on behalf of foreign powers.  The Act uses the term ""political propaganda"" to identify those expressive materials subject to its requirements, and defines the term as,  inter alia,  any communication intended to influence the United States' foreign policies.  Appellee, a member of the California State Senate, wished to show three Canadian films identified by the Department of Justice (DOJ) as ""political propaganda"" under the Act, but did not want to be publicly regarded as a disseminator of ""political propaganda.""  He therefore brought suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the application of the term ""political propaganda"" to the films.  The District Court granted the injunction, holding that the risk of damage to appellee's reputation established his standing to challenge the constitutionality of the use of the term ""political propaganda,"" and that such use violated the First Amendment.  According to the District Court, the public believes that materials to which the term ""political propaganda"" applies have been ""officially censured,"" and therefore those materials are rendered unavailable to people like appellee because of the risk of being seen in an unfavorable light by the public.  In the District Court's view, the conscious use of such a pejorative label was an unnecessary, and therefore invalid abridgment of speech. Held: 1. Appellee has standing to challenge the Act's use of the term ""political propaganda"" as a violation of the First Amendment.  Pp.   481 U. S. 472 -477. (a) That the identification of the films in question as ""political propaganda"" threatens to cause appellee cognizable injury is established by uncontradicted affidavits indicating that his exhibition of the films would substantially harm his chances for reelection and adversely affect his reputation in the community.  Even if he could minimize these risks by providing viewers with a statement about the high quality of the films and his reasons for agreeing with them, the statement would be ineffective among those citizens who shunned the films as ""political propaganda.""  Moreover, the need to take such affirmative steps would itself constitute a cognizable injury to appellee.  Pp.   481 U. S. 472 -476.  (b) The risk of injury to appellee's reputation can be traced to appellants' conduct, since it stems from DOJ's application of the term ""political propaganda"" to the films.  P.   481 U. S. 476 . (c) Granting appellee's requested relief would at least partially redress the complained-of injury, since a judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional would eliminate the need to choose between exhibiting the films and incurring the risk of injury to appellee's reputation.  Pp.   481 U. S. 476 -477. 2. The Act's use of the term ""political propaganda"" is constitutional.  The District Court's holding to the contrary erroneously rests on potential public misunderstanding of the Act's effect, rather than on what the Act actually says, requires, or prohibits.  Pp.   481 U. S. 477 -485. (a) As defined in the Act, the term ""political propaganda"" not only includes slanted, misleading advocacy in the popular, pejorative sense, but also encompasses materials that are completely accurate and merit the highest respect.  Pp.   481 U. S. 477 -478. (b) Since the Act neither inhibits appellee's access to the films nor prohibits, edits, or restrains the distribution of materials to which the term ""political propaganda"" applies, it places no burden on protected expression.  To the contrary, it simply requires the disseminators of propaganda to make additional disclosures to better enable the public to evaluate the material's impact, allows them to add further information that they think germane, and thereby actually fosters freedom of speech.  It is, in fact, the District Court's injunction that wrongfully withholds information -- the fact that the films have been deemed to be ""political propaganda"" -- on the paternalistic assumption that the public will misunderstand, and therefore misuse the information.  Pp.   481 U. S. 480 -483. (c) Although the Act's definition of ""political propaganda"" has existed since 1942, there is no evidence that public misunderstanding or the fear thereof has actually interfered with the exhibition of a significant number of foreign-made films.  Pp.   481 U. S. 483 -484. (d) The Act's use of the term ""political propaganda"" is neutral, evenhanded, and without pejorative connotation, and is therefore constitutionally permissible.  Pp.   481 U. S. 484 -485. 619 F. Supp. 1111, reversed and remanded. STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE, POWELL, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.

 Syllabus   Under  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , the third or ""value"" prong of the tripartite test for judging whether material is obscene requires the trier of fact to determine ""whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.""  After petitioners, both of whom were attendants at adult bookstores, sold certain magazines to police, they were separately charged with the offense of ""obscenity"" under Illinois law.  Both trial courts instructed the respective juries that, to convict, they must find,  inter alia,  that the magazines were without ""value.""  The juries were also instructed to judge whether the material was obscene by determining how it would be viewed by ordinary adults in the whole State of Illinois.  The State Appellate Court affirmed both petitioners' convictions, rejecting their contention that the ""value"" issue must be determined solely on an objective basis, and not by reference to ""contemporary community standards."" Held: 1. In a prosecution for the sale of allegedly obscene materials, the jury should not be instructed to apply community standards in deciding the value question.  Only the first and second prongs of the  Miller  test -- appeal to prurient interest and patent offensiveness -- should be decided with reference to ""contemporary community standards.""  The ideas that a work represents need not obtain majority approval to merit protection, and the value of that work does not vary from community to community based on the degree of local acceptance it has won.  The proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member of any given community would find serious value in the allegedly obscene material, but whether a reasonable person would find such value in the material, taken as a whole.  The instruction at issue therefore violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   481 U. S. 500 -501. 2. Whether petitioners' convictions should be reversed outright, or are subject to salvage because the erroneous instruction constituted harmless error, will not be decided by this Court, since the State Appellate Court has not considered the harmless error issue.  Under  Rose v. Clark,   478 U. S. 570 , in the absence of error that renders a trial fundamentally unfair, a conviction should be affirmed where the reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial established guilt beyond   a reasonable doubt.  Here, since the jurors were not precluded from considering the value question, petitioners' convictions should stand despite the erroneous ""community standards"" instruction if the appellate court concludes that no rational juror, if properly instructed, could find ""value"" in the magazines petitioners sold.

 SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT
 Syllabus   Rotary International is a nonprofit corporation composed of local Rotary Clubs.  Its purposes are to provide humanitarian service, to encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and to help build world peace and good will.  Individuals are admitted to local club membership according to a ""classification system"" based on business, professional, and institutional activity in the community.  Although women are permitted to attend meetings, give speeches, receive awards, and form auxiliary organizations, the Rotary constitution excludes women from membership.  Because it had admitted women to active membership, the Duarte, California, Rotary Club's membership in the international organization was terminated.  That club and two of its women members filed a suit alleging that the termination violated California's Unruh Act (Act), which entitles all persons, regardless of sex, to full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, and services in all business establishments in the State.  The state trial court entered judgment for Rotary International, concluding that neither it nor the Duarte Club is a ""business establishment"" within the meaning of the Act.  However, the State Court of Appeal reversed on this point, and rejected the contention that Rotary's policy of excluding women is protected by the First Amendment.  Accordingly, the court ordered the Duarte Club's reinstatement, and enjoined the enforcement of the gender requirements against it. Held: 1. The Unruh Act does not violate the First Amendment by requiring California Rotary Clubs to admit women.  Pp.   481 U. S. 544 -549. (a) Application of the Act to local Rotary Clubs does not interfere unduly with club members' freedom of private association.  In determining whether a particular association is sufficiently intimate or private to warrant constitutional protection, consideration must be given to factors such as size, purpose, selectivity, and whether others are excluded from critical aspects of the relationship.  Here, the relationship among Rotary Club members does not warrant protection, in light of the potentially large size of local clubs, the high turnover rate among club members, the inclusive nature of each club's membership, the public purposes behind clubs' service activities, and the fact that the clubs encourage the   participation of strangers in, and welcome media coverage of, many of their central activities.  Pp.   481 U. S. 544 -547. (b) Application of the Act to California Rotary Clubs does not violate the First Amendment right of expressive association.  Although clubs engage in a variety of commendable service activities that are protected by the First Amendment, the evidence fails to demonstrate that admitting women will affect in any significant way the existing members' ability to carry out those activities.  Moreover, the Act does not require clubs to abandon or alter their classification and admission systems, but, in fact, will permit them to have an even more representative membership with a broadened capacity for service.  Even if the Act does work some slight infringement of members' rights, that infringement is justified by the State's compelling interests in eliminating discrimination against women and in assuring them equal access to public accommodations.  The latter interest extends to the acquisition of leadership skills and business contacts, as well as tangible goods and services.  Pp.   481 U. S. 548 -549. 2. The contentions that the Act is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad were not properly presented to the state courts, and therefore will not be reviewed by this Court.  Pp.   481 U. S. 549 -550. 178 Cal. App. 3d 1035 ,  224 Cal. Rptr. 213 , affirmed. POWELL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent inmates brought a class action challenging two regulations promulgated by the Missouri Division of Corrections.  The first permits correspondence between immediate family members who are inmates at different institutions within the Division's jurisdiction, and between inmates ""concerning legal matters,"" but allows other inmate correspondence only if each inmate's classification/treatment team deems it in the best interests of the parties.  The second regulation permits an inmate to marry only with the prison superintendent's permission, which can be given only when there are ""compelling reasons"" to do so.  Testimony indicated that generally only a pregnancy or the birth of an illegitimate child would be considered ""compelling.""  The Federal District Court found both regulations unconstitutional, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. The lower courts erred in ruling that  Procunier v. Martinez,   416 U. S. 396 , and its progeny require the application of a strict scrutiny standard of review for resolving respondents' constitutional complaints.  Rather, those cases indicate that a lesser standard is appropriate whereby inquiry is made into whether a prison regulation that impinges on inmates' constitutional rights is ""reasonably related"" to legitimate penological interests.  In determining reasonableness, relevant factors include (a) whether there is a ""valid, rational connection"" between the regulation and a legitimate and neutral governmental interest put forward to justify it, which connection cannot be so remote as to render the regulation arbitrary or irrational; (b) whether there are alternative means of exercising the asserted constitutional right that remain open to inmates, which alternatives, if they exist, will require a measure of judicial deference to the corrections officials' expertise; (c) whether and the extent to which accommodation of the asserted right will have an impact on prison staff, on inmates' liberty, and on the allocation of limited prison resources, which impact, if substantial, will require particular deference to corrections officials; and (d) whether the regulation represents an ""exaggerated response"" to prison concerns, the existence of a ready alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner's rights at  de minimis    costs to valid penological interests being evidence of unreasonableness.    482 U. S.    84-91. 2. The Missouri inmate correspondence regulation is, on the record here, reasonable and facially valid.  The regulation is logically related to the legitimate security concerns of prison officials, who testified that mail between prisons can be used to communicate escape plans, to arrange violent acts, and to foster prison gang activity.  Moreover, the regulation does not deprive prisoners of all means of expression, but simply bars communication with a limited class of people -- other inmates -- with whom authorities have particular cause to be concerned.  The regulation is entitled to deference on the basis of the significant impact of prison correspondence on the liberty and safety of other prisoners and prison personnel, in light of officials' testimony that such correspondence facilitates the development of informal organizations that threaten safety and security at penal institutions.  Nor is there an obvious, easy alternative to the regulation, since monitoring inmate correspondence clearly would impose more than a  de minimis  cost in terms of the burden on staff resources required to conduct item-by-item censorship, and would create an appreciable risk of missing dangerous communications.  The regulation is content-neutral, and does not unconstitutionally abridge the First Amendment rights of prison inmates.  Pp.   482 U. S. 91 -93. 3. The constitutional right of prisoners to marry is impermissibly burdened by the Missouri marriage regulation.    482 U. S.    94-99. (a) Prisoners have a constitutionally protected right to marry under  Zablocki v. Redhail,   434 U. S. 374 .  Although such a marriage is subject to substantial restrictions as a result of incarceration, sufficient important attributes of marriage remain to form a constitutionally protected relationship.   Butler v. Wilson,  415 U.S. 953, distinguished.    482 U. S.    94-96. (b) The regulation is facially invalid under the reasonable relationship test.  Although prison officials may regulate the time and circumstances under which a marriage takes place, and may require prior approval by the warden, the almost complete ban on marriages here is not, on the record, reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives.  The contention that the regulation serves security concerns by preventing ""love triangles"" that may lead to violent inmate confrontations is without merit, since inmate rivalries are likely to develop with or without a formal marriage ceremony.   Moreover, the regulation's broad prohibition is not justified by the security of fellow inmates and prison staff, who are not affected where the inmate makes the private decision to marry a civilian.  Rather, the regulation represents an exaggerated response to the claimed security objectives, since allowing marriages unless the warden finds a threat to security, order, or the public safety represents   an obvious, easy alternative that would accommodate the right to marry while imposing a  de minimis  burden.  Nor is the regulation reasonably related to the articulated rehabilitation goal of fostering self-reliance by female prisoners.  In requiring refusal of permission to marry to all inmates absent a compelling reason, the regulation sweeps much more broadly than is necessary, in light of officials' testimony that male inmates' marriages had generally caused them no problems, and that they had no objections to prisoners marrying civilians.

 THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondents, prison inmates and members of the Islamic faith, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 contending that two policies adopted by New Jersey prison officials prevented them from attending Jumu'ah, a Muslim congregational service held on Friday afternoons, and thereby violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  The first such policy, Standard 853, required inmates in respondents' custody classifications to work outside the buildings in which they were housed and in which Jumu'ah was held, while the second, a policy memorandum, prohibited inmates assigned to outside work from returning to those buildings during the day.  The Federal District Court concluded that no constitutional violation had occurred, but the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded, ruling that the prison policies could be sustained only if the State showed that the challenged regulations were intended to and did serve the penological goal of security, and that no reasonable method existed by which prisoners' religious rights could be accommodated without creating bona fide security problems.  The court also held that the expert testimony of prison officials should be given due weight on, but is not dispositive of, the accommodation issue. Held: 1. The Court of Appeals erred in placing the burden on prison officials to disprove the availability of alternative methods of accommodating prisoners' religious rights.  That approach fails to reflect the respect and deference the Constitution allows for the judgment of prison administrators.  P.   482 U. S. 350 . 2. The District Court's findings establish that the policies challenged here are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, and therefore do not offend the Free Exercise Clause.  Both policies have a rational connection to the legitimate governmental interests in institutional order and security invoked to justify them, as is demonstrated by findings that Standard 853 was a response to critical overcrowding and was designed to ease tension and drain on the facilities during that part of the day when the inmates were outside, and that the policy memorandum was necessary since returns from outside work details generated congestion and delays at the main gate, a high-risk area, and since the   need to decide return requests placed pressure on guards supervising outside work details.  Rehabilitative concerns also support the policy memorandum, in light of testimony indicating that corrections officials sought thereby to simulate working conditions and responsibilities in society.  Although the policies at issue may prevent some Muslim prisoners from attending Jumu'ah, their reasonableness is supported by the fact that they do not deprive respondents of all forms of religious exercise, but instead allow participation in a number of Muslim religious ceremonies.  Furthermore, there are no obvious, easy alternatives to the policies, since both of respondents' suggested accommodations would, in the judgment of prison officials, have adverse effects on the prison institution.  Placing all Muslim inmates in inside work details would be inconsistent with the legitimate concerns underlying Standard 853, while providing weekend labor for Muslims would require extra supervision that would be a drain on scarce human resources.  Both proposed accommodations would also threaten prison security by fostering ""affinity groups"" likely to challenge institutional authority, while any special arrangements for one group would create a perception of favoritism on the part of other inmates.  Pp.   482 U. S. 350 -353. 3. Even where claims are made under the First Amendment, this Court will not substitute its judgment on difficult and sensitive matters of institutional administration for the determinations of those charged with the formidable task of running a prison.

 THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Upon shouting at police in an attempt to divert their attention from his friend during a confrontation, appellee was arrested for ""willfully . . . interrupt[ing] a city policeman . . . by verbal challenge during an investigation"" in violation of a municipal ordinance making it unlawful for any person ""to assault, strike or in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty.""  After his acquittal in Municipal Court, appellee brought suit in Federal District Court challenging the ordinance's constitutionality and seeking,  inter alia,  damages and attorney's fees.  The District Court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face, but the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ordinance was substantially overbroad, since its literal wording punished and might deter a significant range of protected speech. Held: 1. A municipal ordinance that makes it unlawful to interrupt a police officer in the performance of his duty is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid on its face under the First Amendment.  The ordinance in question criminalizes a substantial amount of, and is susceptible of regular application to, constitutionally protected speech, and accords the police unconstitutional enforcement discretion, as is demonstrated by evidence indicating that, although the ordinance's plain language is violated scores of times daily, only those individuals chosen by police in their unguided discretion are arrested.  Appellant's argument that the ordinance is not substantially overbroad because it does not inhibit the exposition of ideas, but simply bans unprotected ""core criminal conduct,"" is not persuasive.  Since the ordinance's language making it unlawful to ""assault"" or ""strike"" a police officer is expressly preempted by the State Penal Code, its enforceable portion prohibits verbal interruptions of police, and thereby deals with speech, rather than with core criminal conduct.  Moreover, although speech might be prohibited if it consists of ""fighting words"" that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace, the ordinance in question is not limited to such expressions, but broadly applies to speech that ""in any manner . . . interrupt[s] any policeman,"" and thereby impermissibly infringes the constitutionally protected freedom of individuals verbally to   oppose or challenge police action.  Appellant's contention that the ordinance's sweeping nature is both inevitable and essential to maintain public order is also without merit, since the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to prohibit only disorderly conduct or fighting words, but impermissibly provides police with unfettered discretion to arrest individuals for words or conduct that are simply annoying or offensive.  Pp.   482 U. S. 458 -467. 2. Abstention -- assertedly to allow the state courts to reach a readily available limiting construction that would eliminate the ordinance's overbreadth -- would be inappropriate here.  Even if this case did not involve a First Amendment facial challenge, for which abstention is particularly inappropriate, the ordinance in question is plain and unambiguous, and thus is not susceptible to a limiting construction.  Moreover, it cannot be limited by severing discrete unconstitutional subsections, since its enforceable portion is unconstitutional in its entirety.  Even if the municipal courts had not had many opportunities to narrow the ordinance's scope, appellant's claim that state courts had not had the chance to construe the ordinance would be unavailing in light of the ordinance's nonambiguity.  Nor does the availability of certification to state courts under state law in itself render abstention appropriate where, as here, there is no uncertain question of state law to be resolved.  Pp.   482 U. S. 467 -471. 3. Although the preservation of liberty depends in part upon the maintenance of social order, the First Amendment requires that officers and municipalities respond with restraint in the face of verbal challenges to police action, since a certain amount of expressive disorder is inevitable in a society committed to individual freedom, and must be protected if that freedom would survive.

 Syllabus   Petitioner Board of Airport Commissioners of Los Angeles adopted a resolution banning all ""First Amendment activities"" within the ""Central Terminal Area"" at Los Angeles International Airport. Respondents, a nonprofit religious corporation and a minister for that organization, filed an action in Federal District Court challenging the resolution's constitutionality, after the minister had stopped distributing free religious literature in the airport's Central Terminal Area when warned against doing so by an airport officer.  The court held that the Central Terminal Area was a traditional public forum under federal law, and that the resolution was facially unconstitutional under the Federal Constitution.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   The resolution violates the First Amendment.  It is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine regardless of whether the forum involved is a public or nonpublic forum (which need not be decided here).  The resolution's facial overbreadth is substantial, since it prohibits all protected expression and does not merely regulate expressive activity that might create problems such as congestion or the disruption of airport users' activities.  Under such a sweeping ban, virtually every individual who enters the airport may be found to violate the resolution by engaging in some ""First Amendment activit[y].""  The ban would be unconstitutional even if the airport were a nonpublic forum, because no conceivable governmental interest would justify such an absolute prohibition of speech.  Moreover, the resolution's words leave no room for a narrowing, saving construction by state courts.   Cf. Baggett v. Bullitt,   377 U. S. 360 .  The suggestion that the resolution is not substantially overbroad because it is intended to reach only expressive activity unrelated to airport-related purposes is unpersuasive.  Much nondisruptive speech may not be airport related, but is still protected speech even in a nonpublic forum.  Moreover, the vagueness of the suggested construction -- which would result in giving airport officials the power to decide in the first instance whether a given activity is airport-related -- presents serious constitutional difficulty.

 Syllabus   Louisiana's ""Creationism Act"" forbids the teaching of the theory of evolution in public elementary and secondary schools unless accompanied by instruction in the theory of ""creation science.""  The Act does not require the teaching of either theory unless the other is taught.  It defines the theories as ""the scientific evidences for [creation or evolution] and inferences from those scientific evidences.""  Appellees, who include Louisiana parents, teachers, and religious leaders, challenged the Act's constitutionality in Federal District Court, seeking an injunction and declaratory relief.  The District Court granted summary judgment to appellees, holding that the Act violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. The Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose.  Pp.   482 U.S. 585 -594. (a) The Act does not further its stated secular purpose of ""protecting academic freedom.""  It does not enhance the freedom of teachers to teach what they choose, and fails to further the goal of ""teaching all of the evidence.""  Forbidding the teaching of evolution when creation science is not also taught undermines the provision of a comprehensive scientific education.  Moreover, requiring the teaching of creation science with evolution does not give schoolteachers a flexibility that they did not already possess to supplant the present science curriculum with the presentation of theories, besides evolution, about the origin of life.  Furthermore, the contention that the Act furthers a ""basic concept of fairness"" by requiring the teaching of all of the evidence on the subject is without merit.  Indeed, the Act evinces a discriminatory preference for the teaching of creation science and against the teaching of evolution by requiring that curriculum guides be developed and resource services supplied for teaching creationism, but not for teaching evolution, by limiting membership on the resource services panel to ""creation scientists,"" and by forbidding school boards to discriminate against anyone who ""chooses to be a creation scientist"" or to teach creation science, while failing to protect those who choose to teach other theories or who refuse   to teach creation science.  A law intended to maximize the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of science instruction would encourage the teaching of all scientific theories about human origins.  Instead, this Act has the distinctly different purpose of discrediting evolution by counterbalancing its teaching at every turn with the teaching of creationism.  Pp.   482 U. S. 586 -589. (b) The Act impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind.  The legislative history demonstrates that the term ""creation science,"" as contemplated by the state legislature, embraces this religious teaching.  The Act's primary purpose was to change the public school science curriculum to provide persuasive advantage to a particular religious doctrine that rejects the factual basis of evolution in its entirety.  Thus, the Act is designed either to promote the theory of creation science that embodies a particular religious tenet or to prohibit the teaching of a scientific theory disfavored by certain religious sects.  In either case, the Act violates the First Amendment.  Pp.   482 U. S. 589 -594. 2. The District Court did not err in granting summary judgment upon a finding that appellants had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.  Appellants relied on the ""uncontroverted"" affidavits of scientists, theologians, and an education administrator defining creation science as ""origin through abrupt appearance in complex form"" and alleging that such a viewpoint constitutes a true scientific theory.  The District Court, in its discretion, properly concluded that the postenactment testimony of these experts concerning the possible technical meanings of the Act's terms would not illuminate the contemporaneous purpose of the state legislature when it passed the Act.  None of the persons making the affidavits produced by appellants participated in or contributed to the enactment of the law.  Pp.   482 U. S. 594 -596. 765 F.2d 1251, affirmed.

 THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent, a data-entry employee in a county Constable's office, was discharged for remarking to a coworker, after hearing of an attempt on the President's life, ""if they go for him again, I hope they get him.""  Respondent was not a commissioned peace officer, did not wear a uniform, was not authorized to make arrests or permitted to carry a gun, and was not brought by virtue of her job into contact with the public.  Her duties were purely clerical, were limited solely to the civil process function of the Constable's office, and did not involve her in the office's minimal law enforcement activity.  Her statement was made during a private conversation in a room not readily accessible to the public.  The Constable fired petitioner because of the statement.  She then brought suit in the Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that her discharge violated her First Amendment right to free speech under color of state law.  The court upheld the discharge, but the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded, whereupon the District Court again ruled against respondent.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for determination of an appropriate remedy, holding that respondent's remark had addressed a matter of public concern, and that the governmental interest in maintaining efficiency and discipline in the workplace did not outweigh society's First Amendment interest in protecting respondent's speech. Held:   Respondent's discharge violated her First Amendment right to freedom of expression.  Pp.   483 U. S. 383 -392. (a) The content, form, and context of respondent's statement, as revealed by the record, support the threshold conclusion that the statement constitutes speech on a matter of public concern.  The statement was made in the course of a conversation addressing the policies of the President's administration, and came on the heels of a news bulletin regarding a matter of heightened public attention:  an attempt on the President's life.  Although a statement amounting to a threat to kill the President would not be protected by the First Amendment, the lower courts correctly concluded that respondent's remark could not properly be criminalized.  Moreover, the inappropriate or controversial character of a statement is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.  Pp.   483 U. S. 384 -387.  (b) Petitioners have not met their burden of demonstrating a state interest justifying respondent's discharge that outweighs her First Amendment rights, given the functions of the Constable's office, respondent's position therein, and the nature of her statement.  Although that statement was made at the workplace, there is no evidence that it interfered with the efficient functioning of the office.  Nor was there any danger that respondent had discredited the office by making the statement in public.  Her discharge was not based on any assessment that her remark demonstrated a character trait that made her unfit to perform her work, which involved no confidential or policymaking role.  Furthermore, there was no danger that the statement would have a detrimental impact on her working relationship with the Constable, since their employment-related interaction was apparently negligible.

 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Section 110 of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 (Act) grants respondent United States Olympic Committee (USOC) the right to prohibit certain commercial and promotional uses of the word ""Olympic"" and various Olympic symbols.  Petitioner San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. (SFAA), a nonprofit California corporation, promoted the ""Gay Olympic Games,"" to be held in 1982, by using those words on its letterheads and mailings, in local newspapers, and on various merchandise sold to cover the costs of the planned Games.  The USOC informed the SFAA of the existence of the Act and requested that it terminate use of the word ""Olympic"" in its description of the planned Games.  When the SFAA failed to do so, the USOC brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive relief.  The court granted the USOC summary judgment and a permanent injunction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Act granted the USOC exclusive use of the word ""Olympic"" without requiring the USOC to prove that the unauthorized use was confusing and without regard to the defenses available to an entity sued for a trademark violation under the Lanham Act.  The court also found that the USOC's property right in the word and its associated symbols and slogans can be protected without violating the First Amendment.  The court did not reach the SFAA's claim that the USOC's enforcement of its rights was discriminatory in violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it held that the USOC is not a governmental actor to which the Constitution applies. Held: 1. There is no merit to the SFAA's contention that § 110 grants the USOC nothing more than a trademark in the word ""Olympic,"" and precludes its use by others only when it tends to cause confusion.  Nor is there any merit to the argument that § 110's reference to Lanham Act remedies should be read as incorporating traditional defenses as well.  Section 110's language and legislative history indicate that Congress intended to grant the USOC exclusive use of the word ""Olympic"" without regard to whether use of the word tends to cause confusion, and that § 110 does not incorporate defenses available under the Lanham Act.  Pp.   483 U. S. 528 -530  2. Also without merit is the SFAA's argument that the word ""Olympic"" is a generic word that constitutionally cannot gain trademark protection under the Lanham Act, and that the First Amendment prohibits Congress from granting a trademark in the word.  When a word acquires value as the result of organization and the expenditure of labor, skill, and money by an entity, that entity constitutionally may obtain a limited property right in the word.  Congress reasonably could conclude that the commercial and promotional value of the word ""Olympic"" was the product of the USOC's talents and energy, the end result of much time, effort, and expense.  In view of the history of the origins and associations of the word ""Olympic,"" Congress' decision to grant the USOC a limited property right in the word falls within the scope of trademark law protections, and thus within constitutional bounds.  Pp.   483 U. S. 532 -535. 3. The First Amendment does not prohibit Congress from granting exclusive use of a word without requiring that the authorized user prove that an unauthorized use is likely to cause confusion.  The SFAA claims that its use of the word ""Olympic"" was intended to convey a political statement about the status of homosexuals in society, and that § 110 may not suppress such speech.  However, by prohibiting the use of one word for particular purposes, neither Congress nor the USOC has prohibited the SFAA from conveying its message.  Section 110's restrictions on expressive speech are properly characterized as incidental to the primary congressional purpose of encouraging and rewarding the USOC's activities.  Congress has a broad public interest in promoting, through the USOC's activities, the participation of amateur athletes from the United States in the Olympic Games.  Even though § 110's protection may exceed traditional rights of a trademark owner in certain circumstances, the Act's application to commercial speech is not broader than necessary to protect the legitimate congressional interests, and therefore does not violate the First Amendment.  Congress reasonably could find that the use of the word by other entities to promote an athletic event would directly impinge on the USOC's legitimate right of exclusive use.  The mere fact that the SFAA claims an expressive, as opposed to a purely commercial, purpose does not give it a First Amendment right to appropriate the value which the USOC's efforts have given to the word.  Pp.   483 U. S. 535 -541. 4. The SFAA's claim that the USOC has enforced its § 110 rights in a discriminatory manner in violation of the Fifth Amendment fails, because the USOC is not a governmental actor to whom the Fifth Amendment applies.  The fact that Congress granted it a corporate charter does not render the USOC a Government agent.  Moreover, Congress' intent to help the USOC obtain funding does not change the analysis.  Nor does the USOC perform functions that are traditionally the exclusive   prerogative of the Federal Government.  The USOC's choice of how to enforce its exclusive right to use the word ""Olympic"" simply is not a governmental decision.  Pp.   483 U. S. 542 -547. 781 F.2d 733 and 789 F.2d 1319, affirmed.

 APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondents, former high school students who were staff members of the school's newspaper, filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, the school district and school officials, alleging that respondents' First Amendment rights were violated by the deletion from a certain issue of the paper of two pages that included an article describing school students' experiences with pregnancy and another article discussing the impact of divorce on students at the school.  The newspaper was written and edited by a journalism class, as part of the school's curriculum.  Pursuant to the school's practice, the teacher in charge of the paper submitted page proofs to the school's principal, who objected to the pregnancy story because the pregnant students, although not named, might be identified from the text, and because he believed that the article's references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for some of the younger students.  The principal objected to the divorce article because the page proofs he was furnished identified by name (deleted by the teacher from the final version) a student who complained of her father's conduct, and the principal believed that the student's parents should have been given an opportunity to respond to the remarks or to consent to their publication.  Believing that there was no time to make necessary changes in the articles if the paper was to be issued before the end of the school year, the principal directed that the pages on which they appeared be withheld from publication even though other, unobjectionable articles were included on such pages.  The District Court held that no First Amendment violation had occurred.  The Court of Appeals reversed. Held:   Respondents' First Amendment rights were not violated. (a) First Amendment rights of students in the public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.  A school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission, even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school. (b) The school newspaper here cannot be characterized as a forum for public expression.  School facilities may be deemed to be public forums   only if school authorities have, by policy or by practice, opened the facilities for indiscriminate use by the general public, or by some segment of the public, such as student organizations.  If the facilities have instead been reserved for other intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, then no public forum has been created, and school officials may impose reasonable restrictions on the speech of students, teachers, and other members of the school community.  The school officials in this case did not deviate from their policy that the newspaper's production was to be part of the educational curriculum and a regular classroom activity under the journalism teacher's control as to almost every aspect of publication.  The officials did not evince any intent to open the paper's pages to indiscriminate use by its student reporters and editors, or by the student body generally.  Accordingly, school officials were entitled to regulate the paper's contents in any reasonable manner. (c) The standard for determining when a school may punish student expression that happens to occur on school premises is not the standard for determining when a school may refuse to lend its name and resources to the dissemination of student expression.   Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.,   393 U. S. 503 , distinguished.  Educators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities, so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns. (d) The school principal acted reasonably in this case in requiring the deletion of the pregnancy article, the divorce article, and the other articles that were to appear on the same pages of the newspaper. 795 F.2d 1368, reversed.

 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent, a nationally known minister and commentator on politics and public affairs, filed a diversity action in Federal District Court against petitioners, a nationally circulated magazine and its publisher, to recover damages for,  inter alia,  libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the publication of an advertisement ""parody"" which, among other things, portrayed respondent as having engaged in a drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an outhouse.  The jury found against respondent on the libel claim, specifically finding that the parody could not ""reasonably be understood as describing actual facts . . . or events,"" but ruled in his favor on the emotional distress claim, stating that he should be awarded compensatory and punitive damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' contention that the ""actual malice"" standard of  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , must be met before respondent can recover for emotional distress.  Rejecting as irrelevant the contention that, because the jury found that the parody did not describe actual facts, the ad was an opinion protected by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution, the court ruled that the issue was whether the ad's publication was sufficiently outrageous to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress. Held:   In order to protect the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit public figures and public officials from recovering damages for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress by reason of the publication of a caricature such as the ad parody at issue without showing in addition that the publication contains a false statement of fact which was made with ""actual malice,""  i.e.,  with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true.  The State's interest in protecting public figures from emotional distress is not sufficient to deny First Amendment protection to speech that is patently offensive and is intended to inflict emotional injury when that speech could not reasonably have been interpreted as stating actual facts about the public figure involved.  Here, respondent is clearly a ""public figure"" for First Amendment purposes, and the lower courts' finding that the ad parody was not reasonably believable must be accepted.  ""Outrageousness""   in the area of political and social discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression, and cannot, consistently with the First Amendment, form a basis for the award of damages for conduct such as that involved here.

 Syllabus   District of Columbia Code § 22-1115 makes it unlawful, within 500 feet of a foreign embassy, either to display any sign that tends to bring the foreign government into ""public odium"" or ""public disrepute"" (display clause), or to congregate and refuse to obey a police dispersal order (congregation clause).  Petitioners, who wish to engage in conduct that would violate both clauses, filed suit in Federal District Court against respondent city officials, asserting a facial First Amendment challenge to § 22-1115.  The court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that both clauses were constitutional.

 THE TENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A Colorado statute allows a proposed state constitutional amendment to be placed on a general election ballot if its proponents can obtain the signatures of at least 5 percent of the total number of qualified voters on an ""initiative petition"" within a 6-month period, but makes it a felony to pay petition circulators.  Concluding that they would need the assistance of paid personnel to obtain the required signatures within the allotted time, appellee proponents of a constitutional amendment that would remove motor carriers from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission's jurisdiction brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against appellant state officials, seeking a declaration that the statutory payment prohibition violated their First Amendment rights.  The District Court upheld the statute, but the Court of Appeals ultimately reversed, holding that the statute violates the First Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Held:   The statutory prohibition against the use of paid circulators abridges appellees' right to engage in political speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.   486 U. S. 420 -428. (a) The statute is subject to exacting scrutiny, since the circulation of an initiative petition seeking to deregulate the Colorado trucking industry necessarily constitutes ""core political speech,"" for which First Amendment protection is at its zenith.  The statute burdens such speech in two ways:  First, it limits the number of voices who will convey appellees' message and the hours they can speak and, therefore, limits the size of the audience they can reach.  Second, it makes it less likely that appellees will garner the number of necessary signatures, thus limiting their ability to make the matter the focus of statewide discussion.  The statute's burden on speech is not relieved by the fact that other avenues of expression remain open to appellees, since the use of paid circulators is the most effective, fundamental, and perhaps economical means of achieving direct, one-on-one communication, and appellees' right to utilize that means is itself protected by the First Amendment.  Nor is the statutory burden rendered acceptable by the State's claimed authority to impose limitations on the scope of the state-created right to legislate by initiative; the power to ban initiatives entirely does not include   the power to limit discussion of political issues raised in initiative petitions.   Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico,   478 U. S. 328 , distinguished.  Pp.   486 U. S. 420 -425. (b) The State has failed to sustain its burden of justifying the statutory prohibition.  The argument that justification is found in the State's interest in assuring that an initiative has sufficient grass roots support to be placed on the ballot is not persuasive, since that interest is adequately protected by the requirement that the specified number of signatures be obtained.  Nor does the State's claimed interest in protecting the integrity of the initiative process justify the prohibition, because the State has failed to demonstrate the necessity of burdening appellees' ability to communicate in order to meet its concerns.  It cannot be assumed that a professional circulator -- whose qualifications for similar future assignments may well depend on a reputation for competence and integrity -- is any more likely to accept false signatures than a volunteer motivated entirely by an interest in having the proposition placed on the ballot.  Moreover, other statutory provisions dealing expressly with the potential danger of false signatures are adequate to minimize the risk of improper circulation conduct.  Pp.   486 U. S. 425 -428. 828 F.2d 1446, affirmed. STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."

 THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   In federal court proceedings, appellee newspaper publisher challenged, on First Amendment grounds, the facial constitutionality of appellant city's ordinance authorizing the Mayor to grant or deny applications for annual permits to publishers to place their newsracks on public property, and, if the application is denied, requiring the Mayor to ""stat[e] the reasons for such denial.""  If the application is granted, the ordinance provides that the permit is subject,  inter alia,  to any ""terms and conditions deemed necessary and reasonable by the Mayor.""  The District Court found the ordinance constitutional in its entirety, and entered judgment for the city.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding the ordinance unconstitutional on the ground, among others, that it gave the Mayor unbounded discretion to grant or deny a permit application and to place unlimited terms and conditions on any permit that issued. Held: 1. Appellee may bring a facial challenge to the ordinance without first applying for, and being denied, a permit.  Pp.   486 U. S. 755 -769. (a) When a licensing statute vests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity, one who is subject to the law may challenge it facially without first submitting to the licensing process.  Such a statute constitutes a prior restraint, and may result in censorship, engendering risks to free expression that can be effectively alleviated only through a facial challenge.  The mere existence of the licensor's unfettered discretion, coupled with the power of prior restraint, intimidates parties into censoring their own speech, even if the discretion and power are never actually abused.  Standards limiting the licensor's discretion provide guideposts that check the licensor and allow courts quickly and easily to determine whether the licensor is discriminating against disfavored speech.  Without those standards, the difficulties of proof and the case-by-case nature of ""as applied"" challenges render the licensor's action in large measure effectively unreviewable.  Pp.   486 U. S. 755 -759. (b) The press or a speaker may not challenge as censorship every law involving discretion to which it is subject; the law must have a close enough nexus to expression, or to conduct commonly associated with expression,   to pose a real and substantial threat of censorship risks.  The allowance of a facial challenge here is justified by the features that (1) the ordinance requires annual permit applications, thus permitting the licensor to measure the probable content or viewpoint of future expression by speech already uttered, and (2) the ordinance is directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonly associated with expression -- the circulation of newspapers -- and creates a licensing agency that might tend to favor censorship over speech.  The Constitution requires that the city establish neutral criteria to insure that the Mayor's licensing decision is not based on the content or viewpoint of the speech being considered.  Pp.   486 U. S. 759 -762. (c) There is no merit to the theory that the ordinance is not subject to facial challenge because the particular manner of speech (the use of newsracks) may be prohibited entirely, and thus no ""First Amendment protected activity"" is implicated by the ordinance's imposing less than a total prohibition, even assuming that newsracks may be prohibited entirely.  Presumably in the case of a hypothetical ordinance that completely prohibits a particular manner of expression, the law on its face is both content and viewpoint neutral, and the Court would apply the well settled time, place, and manner test.  In contrast, a law permitting communication in a certain manner for some, but not for others, raises the danger of content and viewpoint censorship, which is at its zenith when the determination of who may speak and who may not is left to an official's unbridled discretion.  Even if the government may constitutionally impose content-neutral prohibitions on a particular manner of speech, it may not condition that speech on obtaining a license from an official in that official's boundless discretion.  Use of the ""greater-includes-the-lesser"" reasoning in the latter context is not supported by this Court's First Amendment cases.  Pp.   486 U. S. 762 -769. 2. The portions of appellant city's ordinance giving the Mayor discretion to deny a permit application and authority to condition a permit on any terms he deems ""necessary and reasonable"" are unconstitutional.  It cannot be presumed that the Mayor will adhere to standards absent from the ordinance's face, and so will deny a permit application only for reasons related to the health, safety, or welfare of city citizens, and that additional terms and conditions will be imposed only for similar reasons.  The doctrine forbidding unbridled discretion requires that the limits the city claims are implicit in its law be made explicit by textual incorporation, binding judicial or administrative construction, or well established practice.  The ordinance's minimal requirement that the Mayor state his reasons for denying a permit does not provide the standards necessary to ensure constitutional decisionmaking, nor does it, of necessity, provide a solid foundation for eventual judicial review.  Even if judicial review   under the ordinance's provision were relatively speedy, such review does not substitute for concrete standards to guide the decisionmaker's discretion.  Pp.   486 U. S. 769 -772. 3. Other questions as to the ordinance's constitutionality presented for review need not be resolved, since the holding regarding the ordinance's mayoral discretion provisions alone sustains the Court of Appeals' judgment if those provisions of the ordinance are not severable from the remainder.  Severability of a local ordinance is a question of state law, and is therefore best resolved below.  P.   486 U. S. 772 . 794 F.2d 1139, affirmed in part and remanded.

 THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Brookfield, Wisconsin, enacted an ordinance making it ""unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual,"" and declaring that the primary purpose of the ban is to ""protec[t] and preserv[e] the home"" through assurance ""that members of the community enjoy in their homes . . . a feeling of wellbeing, tranquility, and privacy.""  Appellees, who wish to picket a particular home in Brookfield, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against appellants, the town and several of its officials, alleging that the ordinance violated the First Amendment.  The Federal District Court granted appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the ordinance was not narrowly tailored enough to restrict protected speech in a public forum.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed. Held:   The ordinance is not facially invalid under the First Amendment.  Pp.   487 U. S. 479 -488. (a) Although the town's streets are narrow and of a residential character, they are nevertheless traditional public fora,  Carey v. Brown,   447 U. S. 455 , and, therefore, the ordinance must be judged against the stringent standards this Court has established for restrictions on speech in such fora.   Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,   460 U. S. 37 .  Pp.   487 U. S. 480 -481. (b) The ordinance is content-neutral, and cannot be read as containing an implied exception for peaceful labor picketing on the theory that an express state law protection for such picketing takes precedence.  This Court will defer to the rejection of that theory by the lower courts, which are better schooled in and more able to interpret Wisconsin law.  Pp.   487 U. S. 481 -482. (c) The ordinance leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.  Although the precise scope of the ordinance's ban is not further described within its text, its use of the singular form of the words ""residence"" and ""dwelling"" suggests that it is intended to prohibit only picketing focused on, and taking place in front of, a particular residence, a reading which is supported by appellants' representations at oral argument.  The lower courts' contrary interpretation of the ordinance as banning ""all picketing in residential areas"" constitutes plain error, and runs afoul of the well-established principle that statutes will be   interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties.  Viewed in the light of the narrowing construction, the ordinance allows protestors to enter residential neighborhoods, either alone or marching in groups; to go door to door to proselytize their views or distribute literature; and to contact residents through the mails or by telephone, short of harassment.  Pp.   487 U. S. 482 -484. (d) As is evidenced by its text, the ordinance serves the significant government interest of protecting residential privacy.  An important aspect of such privacy is the protection of unwilling listeners within their homes from the intrusion of objectionable or unwanted speech.   See, e.g., FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,   438 U. S. 726 .  Moreover, the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve that governmental interest, since, although its ban is complete, it targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of the ""evil"" it seeks to remedy:  offensive and disturbing picketing focused on a ""captive"" home audience.  It does not prohibit more generally directed means of public communication that may not be completely banned in residential areas.  Pp.   487 U. S. 484 -488. 822 F.2d 642, reversed.

 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The North Carolina Charitable Solicitations Act defines the  prima facie  ""reasonable fee"" that a professional fundraiser may charge according to a three-tiered schedule.  A fee up to 20% of receipts collected is deemed reasonable.  A fee between 20% and 35% is deemed unreasonable upon a showing that the solicitation at issue did not involve the ""dissemination of information, discussion, or advocacy relating to public issues as directed by the [charitable organization] which is to benefit from the solicitation."" A fee exceeding 35% is presumed unreasonable, but the fundraiser may rebut the presumption by showing that the fee was necessary either because the solicitation involved the dissemination of information or advocacy on public issues directed by the charity, or because otherwise the charity's ability to raise money or communicate would be significantly diminished.  The Act also provides that a professional fundraiser must disclose to potential donors the average percentage of gross receipts actually turned over to charities by the fundraiser for all charitable solicitations conducted in the State within the previous 12 months.  Finally, the Act provides that professional fundraisers may not solicit without an approved license, whereas volunteer fundraisers may solicit immediately upon submitting a license application.  Appellees, a coalition of professional fundraisers, charitable organizations, and potential donors, brought suit against appellant government officials charged with the enforcement of the Act (hereinafter collectively referred to as North Carolina or the State), seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  The District Court ruled that the challenged provisions on their face unconstitutionally infringed upon freedom of speech, and enjoined their enforcement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. North Carolina's three-tiered definition of ""reasonable fees"" unconstitutionally infringes upon freedom of speech.  The solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech, and using percentages to decide the legality of the fundraiser's fee is not narrowly tailored to the State's   interest in preventing fraud.   Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment,   444 U. S. 620 ;  Secretary of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co.,   467 U. S. 947 .  North Carolina cannot meaningfully distinguish its statute from those previously held invalid on the ground that it has a motivating interest, not present in the prior cases, to ensure that the maximum amount of funds reach the charity, or to guarantee that the fee charged charities is not unreasonable.  This provision is not merely an economic regulation, with no First Amendment implication, to be tested only for rationality; instead, the regulation must be considered as one burdening speech.  The State's asserted justification that charities' speech must be regulated for their own benefit is unsound.  The First Amendment mandates the presumption that speakers, not the government, know best both what they want to say and how to say it.  Also unavailing is the State's contention that the Act's flexibility more narrowly tailors it to the State's asserted interests than the laws invalidated in the prior cases.  The State's asserted additional interests are both constitutionally invalid and insufficiently related to a percentage-based test.  And while a State's interest in protecting charities and the public from fraud is a sufficiently substantial interest to justify a narrowly tailored regulation, the North Carolina statute, even with its flexibility, is not sufficiently tailored to such interest.  Pp.   487 U. S. 787 -795. 2. North Carolina's requirement that professional fundraisers disclose to potential donors, before an appeal for funds, the percentage of charitable contributions collected during the previous 12 months that were actually turned over to charity is unconstitutional.  This provision of the Act is a content-based regulation because mandating speech that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters the speech's content.  Even assuming that the mandated speech, in the abstract, is merely ""commercial,"" it does not retain its commercial character when it is inextricably intertwined with the otherwise fully protected speech involved in charitable solicitations, and thus the mandated speech is subject to the test for fully protected expression, not the more deferential commercial speech principles.  Nor is a deferential test to be applied on the theory that the First Amendment interest in compelled speech is different than the interest in compelled silence.  The difference is without constitutional significance, for the First Amendment guarantees ""freedom of speech,"" a term necessarily comprising the decision of both what to say and what not to say.  Moreover, for First Amendment purposes, a distinction cannot be drawn between compelled statements of opinion and, as here, compelled statements of ""fact,"" since either form of compulsion burdens protected speech.  Thus, North Carolina's content-based regulation is subject to exacting First Amendment scrutiny.  The State's interest in informing donors how the money they contribute is spent to   dispel the alleged misperception that the money they give to professional fundraisers goes in greater-than-actual proportion to benefit charity, is not sufficiently weighty, and the means chosen to accomplish it are unduly burdensome, and not narrowly tailored.  Pp.   487 U. S. 795 -801. 3. North Carolina's licensing requirement for professional fundraisers is unconstitutional.  A speaker's rights are not lost merely because compensation is received, and the State's asserted power to license professional fundraisers carries with it (unless properly constrained) the power directly and substantially to affect the speech they utter.  Consequently, the statute is subject to First Amendment scrutiny.  Generally, speakers need not obtain a license to speak.  Even assuming that the State's interest in regulating those who solicit money justifies requiring fundraisers to obtain a license before soliciting, such a regulation must provide that the licensor will, within a specified brief period, either issue a license or go to court.  That requirement is not met here, for the North Carolina Act permits a delay without limit.  Nor can the State assert that its history of issuing licenses quickly constitutes a practice effectively constraining the licensor's discretion, since such history relates to a time (prior to amendment of the Act) when professional fundraisers were permitted to solicit as soon as their applications were filed.

 THIRD DISTRICT
 Syllabus   Between October, 1984, and October, 1987, a Texas statute exempted from sales and use taxes ""[p]eriodicals . . . published or distributed by a religious faith . . . consist[ing] wholly of writings promulgating the teachings of the faith and books . . . consist[ing] wholly of writings sacred to a religious faith."" In 1985, appellant, the publisher of a general interest magazine that was not entitled to the exemption, paid under protest sales taxes on the price of its qualifying subscription sales and sued to recover those payments in state court.  Ruling that the exclusive exemption for religious periodicals promoted religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, and declaring itself ""without power to rewrite the statute to make religious periodicals subject to tax,"" the court struck down the tax as applied to nonreligious periodicals and ordered the State to refund the tax paid by appellant, plus interest.  The State Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the exemption satisfied the tripartite test of  Lemon v. Kurtzman,   403 U. S. 602 ,   403 U. S. 612 -613, in that it (1) served the secular purpose of preserving separation between church and state; (2) did not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion; and (3) did not produce impermissible government entanglement with religion.  Held:   The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 731 S.W.2d 160, reversed and remanded."

 Syllabus   In No. 87-470, the State of Indiana and a local prosecutor (respondents) filed a civil action in state court against petitioner operator of an ""adult bookstore,"" alleging that it had violated the state Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of repeated violations of the state laws barring the distribution of obscene books and films.  Respondents sought injunctive relief under the state Civil Remedies for Racketeering Activity (CRRA) statute, including forfeiture of all of petitioner's property used in the alleged racketeering activity, and moved, in a separate petition, for a court order for immediate seizure of all property subject to forfeiture, as authorized by statute.  After the court,  ex parte,  heard testimony in support of this petition, it ordered the immediate seizure of petitioner's bookstore and its contents.  Following petitioner's unsuccessful attempts to vacate the seizure order on federal constitutional grounds, the court certified the constitutional issues to the Indiana Court of Appeals, which held that the relevant RICO/CRRA provisions violated the Federal Constitution.  The Indiana Supreme Court reversed, upholding both the constitutionality of the CRRA statute and the pretrial seizure.  In No. 87-614, petitioner ""adult bookstore"" operator was charged with distributing obscene matter in violation of an Indiana statute (a misdemeanor) and in addition with RICO violations (felonies) based on these alleged predicate acts of obscenity.  The trial court dismissed the RICO charges on the ground that the RICO statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to obscenity predicate offenses.  The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the charges, holding that the RICO statute was not unconstitutional as applied to the state obscenity statute, and the Indiana Supreme Court declined review. Held: 1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear No. 87-614.  Under the general rule defining finality in the context of a criminal prosecution by a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence, this Court would usually conclude that, since neither a conviction nor sentence was present here, the judgment below was not final, and hence not reviewable under 28 U.S.C. § 1257, which limits review to ""[f]inal judgments or   decrees.""  But the case merits review under the exception to the general finality rule recognized in  Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn,   420 U. S. 469 ,   420 U. S. 482 -483, ""[w]here the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action."" Petitioner could well prevail on nonfederal grounds at a subsequent trial, and reversal of the Indiana Court of Appeals' holding would bar further prosecution on the RICO charges.  Moreover, the case clearly involves a First Amendment challenge to the Indiana RICO statute's facial validity.  Adjudicating the proper scope of First Amendment protection is a ""federal policy"" that merits application of an exception to the general finality rule.  Resolution of the important issue of the possible limits the First Amendment places on state and federal efforts to control organized crime should not remain in doubt.   Flynt v. Ohio,   451 U. S. 619 , distinguished.  Pp.   489 U. S. 54 -57. 2. There is no constitutional bar to the State's inclusion of substantive obscenity violations among the predicate offenses under its RICO statute.  Pp.   489 U. S. 57 -60. (a) The RICO statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to obscenity predicate offenses.  The ""racketeering activities"" that the statute forbids are a ""pattern"" of multiple violations of certain substantive crimes, of which distributing obscenity is one.  Given that the RICO statute totally encompasses the obscenity law, if the latter is not unconstitutionally vague, the former cannot be vague either.  Petitioner in No. 87-614 cannot be convicted of violating the RICO statute without first being ""found guilty"" of distributing or of attempting or conspiring to distribute obscene materials.  To argue, as petitioner does, that the ""inherent vagueness"" of the obscenity standards established by  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , are at the root of his objection to any RICO prosecution based on predicate acts of obscenity is nothing less than an invitation to overturn  Miller  -- an invitation that this Court rejects.  That the punishments available in a RICO prosecution are different from those for obscenity violations does not render the RICO statute void for vagueness.  Pp.   489 U. S. 57 -58. (b) While the RICO punishments are greater than those for obscenity violations, there is no constitutionally significant difference between them.  The stiffer RICO punishments may provide an additional deterrent to those who might otherwise sell obscene materials and may result in some booksellers practicing self-censorship and removing First Amendment protected materials from their shelves.  But deterrence of the sale of obscene materials is a legitimate end of state obscenity laws,   and the mere assertion of some possible self-censorship resulting from a statute is not enough to render an anti-obscenity law unconstitutional.  Petitioner's contention in No. 87-614 that the civil sanctions available under the CRRA against RICO violations are so severe as to render the RICO statute itself unconstitutional is not ripe, since the State has not sought any civil penalties.  Pp.   489 U. S. 59 -60. (c) There is no constitutional basis for petitioner's contention in No. 87-614 that the alleged predicate acts used in a RICO/obscenity prosecution must be ""affirmed convictions.""  As long as the standard of proof is proper with respect to all elements of the RICO allegation, including proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the requisite number of constitutionally proscribable predicate acts, all of the relevant constitutional requirements have been met.  This Court will not require a State to fire a ""warning shot"" in the form of misdemeanor prosecutions before it may bring felony charges for distributing obscene materials.  And there is no merit to petitioner's contention that the predicate offenses charged must have occurred in the jurisdiction where the RICO indictment is brought, not only because all of petitioner's alleged predicate acts of distributing obscenity did take place in the same jurisdiction where the RICO prosecution was initiated, but more significantly because such a rule would essentially turn the RICO statute on its head.  Pp.   489 U. S. 60 -62. (d) Nor is there any merit to petitioner's contention in No. 87-614 that he should have been provided with a prompt post-arrest adversarial hearing on the question of the obscenity of the materials he allegedly distributed.  He did not request such a hearing, and there was no seizure of any of his books or films.  Police officers' purchases of a few items in connection with their investigation of petitioner's stores did not trigger constitutional concern.  P.   489 U. S. 62 . 3. The pretrial seizure of petitioner's bookstore and its contents in No. 87-470 was improper.  While a single copy of a book or film may be seized and retained for evidentiary purposes based on a finding of probable cause, books or films may not be taken out of circulation completely until there has been a determination of obscenity after an adversary hearing.  The risk of prior restraint, which is the underlying basis for the special Fourth Amendment protection accorded searches for and seizures of First Amendment materials, renders invalid the pretrial seizure here.  Even assuming that petitioner's bookstore and its contents are forfeitable when it is proved that they were used in, or derived from, a pattern of violations of the state obscenity laws, the seizure was unconstitutional.  Probable cause to believe that there are valid grounds for seizure is insufficient to interrupt the sale of presumptively protected books and films.  Here, there was no determination that the seized items were ""obscene"" or that a RICO violation  had occurred.   The petition   for seizure and the hearing thereon were aimed at establishing no more than probable cause to believe that a RICO violation had occurred, and the seizure order recited no more than probable cause in that respect.  Mere probable cause to believe a violation has transpired is not adequate to remove books or film from circulation.  The elements of a RICO violation other than the predicate crimes remain to be established in this case.  Where the claimed RICO violation is a pattern of racketeering that can be established only by rebutting the presumption that expressive materials are protected by the First Amendment, that presumption is not rebutted until the claimed justification for seizing such materials is properly established in an adversary proceeding.

 THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Section 11702 of the California Elections Code (Code) forbids the official governing bodies of political parties to endorse or oppose candidates in primary elections, while § 29430 makes it a misdemeanor for any candidate in a primary to claim official party endorsement.  Other Code sections dictate the organization and composition of parties' governing bodies, limit the term of office for a party's state central committee chair, and require that the chair rotate between residents of northern and southern California.  Various party governing bodies, members of such bodies, and other politically active groups and individuals brought suit in the District Court, claiming,  inter alia,  that these Code provisions deprived parties and their members of the rights of free speech and free association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to the provisions in question, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:   The challenged California election laws are invalid, since they burden the First Amendment rights of political parties and their members without serving a compelling state interest.  Pp.   489 U. S. 222 -233. (a) The ban on primary endorsements in §§ 11702 and 29430 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  By preventing a party's governing body from stating whether a candidate adheres to the party's tenets or whether party officials believe that the candidate is qualified for the position sought, the ban directly hampers the party's ability to spread its message and hamstrings voters seeking to inform themselves about the candidates and issues, and thereby burdens the core right to free political speech of the party and its members.  The ban also infringes a party's protected freedom of association rights to identify the people who constitute the association and to select a standard-bearer who best represents the party's ideology and preferences, by preventing the party from promoting candidates at the crucial primary election juncture.  Moreover, the ban does not serve a compelling governmental interest.  The State has not adequately explained how the ban advances its claimed interest in a stable political system or what makes California so peculiar that it is virtually the only State to determine that such a ban   is necessary.  The explanation that the State's compelling interest in stable government embraces a similar interest in party stability is untenable, since a State may enact laws to prevent disruption of political parties from without, but not from within.  The claim that a party that issues primary endorsements risks intraparty friction which may endanger its general election prospects is insufficient, since the goal of protecting the party against itself would not justify a State's substituting its judgment for that of the party.  The State's claim that the ban is necessary to protect primary voters from confusion and undue influence must be viewed with skepticism, since the ban restricts the flow of information to the citizenry without any evidence of the existence of fraud or corruption that would justify such a restriction.  Pp.   489 U. S. 222 -229. (b) The restrictions on the organization and composition of the official governing bodies of political parties, the limits on the term of office for state central committee chairs, and the requirement that such chairs rotate between residents of northern and southern California cannot be upheld.  These laws directly burden the associational rights of a party and its members by limiting the party's discretion in how to organize itself, conduct its affairs, and select its leaders.  Moreover, the laws do not serve a compelling state interest.  A State cannot justify regulating a party's internal affairs without showing that such regulation is necessary to ensure that elections are orderly, fair, and honest, and California has made no such showing.  The State's claim that it has a compelling interest in the democratic management of internal party affairs is without merit, since this is not a case where intervention is necessary to prevent the derogation of party adherents' civil rights, and since the State has no interest in protecting the party's integrity against the party itself.  Nor are the restrictions justified by the State's claim that limiting the term of the state central committee chair and requiring that the chair rotate between northern and southern California help to prevent regional friction from reaching a critical mass, since a State cannot substitute its judgment for that of the party as to the desirability of a particular party structure.  Pp.   489 U. S. 229 -233. 826 F.2d 814, affirmed.

 Syllabus   For the express purpose of providing a place where teenagers can socialize with each other but not be subject to the potentially detrimental influences of older teenagers and adults, a Dallas ordinance authorizes the licensing of ""Class E"" dancehalls, restricting admission thereto to persons between the ages of 14 and 18 and limiting their hours of operation.  Respondent, whose rollerskating rink and Class E dancehall share a divided floor space, filed suit in state court to enjoin the ordinance's age and hour restrictions, contending,  inter alia,  that they violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court upheld the ordinance, but the Texas Court of Appeals struck down the ordinance's age restriction, holding that it violated the First Amendment associational rights of minors. Held: 1. The ordinance does not infringe on the First Amendment right of association.  Respondent's patrons, who may number as many as 1,000 per night, are not engaged in a form of ""intimate association.""  Nor do the opportunities of adults and minors to dance with one another, which might be described as ""associational"" in common parlance, involve the sort of ""expressive association"" that the First Amendment has been held to protect.  The teenagers who congregate are not members of any organized association, and most are strangers to one another.  The dancehall admits all who pay the admission fee, and there is no suggestion that the patrons take positions on public questions or perform other similar activities.  Moreover, the Constitution does not recognize a generalized right of ""social association"" that includes chance encounters in dancehalls.   Griswold v. Connecticut,   381 U. S. 479 ,   381 U. S. 483 , distinguished.  Pp.   490 U. S. 23 -25. 2. The ordinance does not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there is a rational relationship between the age restriction for Class E dancehalls and the city's interest in promoting the welfare of teenagers.  Respondent's claims -- that the ordinance does not meet the city's objectives because adults and teenagers can still associate with one another in places such as his skating rink and that there are other, less intrusive, alternatives to achieve the objectives -- misapprehend the nature of   rational basis scrutiny, the most relaxed and tolerant form of judicial scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  Under this standard, a classification that has some reasonable basis does not offend the Constitution because it is imperfect.  Here, the city could reasonably conclude that teenagers might be more susceptible to corrupting influences if permitted to frequent dancehalls with older persons or that limiting dance-hall contacts between adults and teenagers would make less likely illicit or undesirable juvenile involvement with alcohol, illegal drugs, or promiscuous sex.  While the city permits teenagers and adults to rollerskate together, skating involves less physical contact than dancing, a differentiation that need not be striking to survive rational-basis scrutiny.

 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Federal Bureau of Prisons regulations generally permit prisoners to receive publications from the ""outside,"" but authorize wardens, pursuant to specified criteria, to reject an incoming publication if it is found ""to be detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity.""  Wardens may not reject a publication ""solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social[,] sexual, or . . . unpopular or repugnant,"" or establish an excluded list of publications, but must review each issue of a subscription separately.  Respondents, a class of inmates and certain publishers, filed suit in the District Court, claiming that the regulations, both on their face and as applied to 46 specifically excluded publications, violated their First Amendment rights under the standard set forth in  Procunier v. Martinez,   416 U. S. 396 .  The District Court refrained from adopting the  Martinez  standard in favor of an approach more deferential to the judgment of prison authorities, and upheld the regulations without addressing the propriety of the 46 exclusions.  The Court of Appeals, however, utilized the  Martinez  standard, found the regulations wanting, and remanded the case for an individualized determination on the constitutionality of the 46 exclusions. Held: 1. Regulations such as those at issue that affect the sending of publications to prisoners must be analyzed under the standard set forth in  Turner v. Safley,   482 U. S. 78 ,   482 U. S. 89 , and are therefore ""valid if [they are] reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.""  Prison officials are due considerable deference in regulating the delicate balance between prison order and security and the legitimate demands of ""outsiders"" who seek to enter the prison environment.  The less deferential standard of  Martinez  -- whereby prison regulations authorizing mail censorship must be ""generally necessary"" to protect one or more legitimate governmental interests -- is limited to regulations concerning outgoing personal correspondence   from prisoners, regulations which are not centrally concerned with the maintenance of prison order and security.  Moreover,  Martinez  is overruled to the extent that it might support the drawing of a categorical distinction between incoming correspondence from prisoners (to which  Turner  applied its reasonableness standard) and incoming correspondence from nonprisoners.  Pp.   490 U. S. 407 -414. 2. The regulations at issue are facially valid under the  Turner  standard.  Their underlying objective of protecting prison security is undoubtedly legitimate, and is neutral with regard to the content of the expression regulated.  Also, the broad discretion the regulations accord wardens is rationally related to security interests.  Furthermore, alternative means of expression remain open to the inmates, since the regulations permit a broad range of publications to be sent, received, and read, even though specific publications are prohibited.  Moreover, respondents have established no alternative to the regulations that would accommodate prisoners' constitutional rights at a  de minimis  cost to valid penological interests.  Pp.   490 U. S. 414 -419. 3. The case is remanded for an examination of the validity of the regulations as applied to any of the 46 publications introduced at trial as to which there remains a live controversy.  P.   490 U. S. 419 . 263 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 824 F.2d 1166, vacated and remanded.

 Syllabus   During the 1984 Republican National Convention, respondent Johnson participated in a political demonstration to protest the policies of the Reagan administration and some Dallas-based corporations.  After a march through the city streets, Johnson burned an American flag while protesters chanted.  No one was physically injured or threatened with injury, although several witnesses were seriously offended by the flag burning.  Johnson was convicted of desecration of a venerated object in violation of a Texas statute, and a state court of appeals affirmed.  However, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed, holding that the State, consistent with the First Amendment, could not punish Johnson for burning the flag in these circumstances.  The court first found that Johnson's burning of the flag was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment.  The court concluded that the State could not criminally sanction flag desecration in order to preserve the flag as a symbol of national unity.  It also held that the statute did not meet the State's goal of preventing breaches of the peace, since it was not drawn narrowly enough to encompass only those flag burnings that would likely result in a serious disturbance, and since the flag burning in this case did not threaten such a reaction.  Further, it stressed that another Texas statute prohibited breaches of the peace and could be used to prevent disturbances without punishing this flag desecration. Held:   Johnson's conviction for flag desecration is inconsistent with the First Amendment.  Pp.   491 U. S. 402 -420. (a) Under the circumstances, Johnson's burning of the flag constituted expressive conduct, permitting him to invoke the First Amendment.  The State conceded that the conduct was expressive.  Occurring as it did at the end of a demonstration coinciding with the Republican National Convention, the expressive, overtly political nature of the conduct was both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent.  Pp.   491 U. S. 402 -406. (b) Texas has not asserted an interest in support of Johnson's conviction that is unrelated to the suppression of expression and would therefore permit application of the test set forth in  United States v. O'Brien,   391 U. S. 367 , whereby an important governmental interest in regulating nonspeech can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms when speech and nonspeech elements are combined in the same course of conduct.  An interest in preventing breaches of the peace is not implicated on this record.  Expression may not be prohibited   on the basis that an audience that takes serious offense to the expression may disturb the peace, since the Government cannot assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but must look to the actual circumstances surrounding the expression.  Johnson's expression of dissatisfaction with the Federal Government's policies also does not fall within the class of ""fighting words"" likely to be seen as a direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs.  This Court's holding does not forbid a State to prevent ""imminent lawless action"" and, in fact, Texas has a law specifically prohibiting breaches of the peace.  Texas' interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity is related to expression in this case and, thus, falls outside the  O'Brien  test.  Pp.   491 U. S. 406 -410. (c) The latter interest does not justify Johnson's conviction.  The restriction on Johnson's political expression is content based, since the Texas statute is not aimed at protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, but is designed to protect it from intentional and knowing abuse that causes serious offense to others.  It is therefore subject to ""the most exacting scrutiny.""   Boos v. Barry,   485 U. S. 312 .  The Government may not prohibit the verbal or nonverbal expression of an idea merely because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable, even where our flag is involved.  Nor may a State foster its own view of the flag by prohibiting expressive conduct relating to it, since the Government may not permit designated symbols to be used to communicate a limited set of messages.  Moreover, this Court will not create an exception to these principles protected by the First Amendment for the American flag alone.  Pp.   491 U. S. 410 -422. 755 S.W.2d 92 , affirmed.

 FIRST DISTRICT
 Syllabus   Appellant, The Florida Star, is a newspaper which publishes a ""Police Reports"" section containing brief articles describing local criminal incidents under police investigation.  After appellee B.J.F. reported to the Sheriff's Department (Department) that she had been robbed and sexually assaulted, the Department prepared a report, which identified B.J.F. by her full name, and placed it in the Department's pressroom.  The Department does not restrict access to the room or to the reports available there.  A Star reporter-trainee sent to the pressroom copied the police report verbatim, including B.J.F.'s full name.  Consequently, her name was included in a ""Police Reports"" story in the paper, in violation of the Star's internal policy.  Florida Stat. § 794.03 makes it unlawful to ""print, publish, or broadcast . . . in any instrument of mass communication"" the name of the victim of a sexual offense.  B.J.F. filed suit in a Florida court alleging,  inter alia,  that the Star had negligently violated § 794.03.  The trial court denied the Star's motion to dismiss, which claimed, among other things, that imposing civil sanctions on the newspaper pursuant to § 794.03 violated the First Amendment.  However, it granted B.J.F.'s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence, finding the Star  per se  negligent based on its violation of § 794.03.  The jury then awarded B.J.F. both compensatory and punitive damages.  The verdict was upheld on appeal. Held:   Imposing damages on the Star for publishing B.J.F.'s name violates the First Amendment.  Pp.   491 U. S. 530 -541. (a) The sensitivity and significance of the interests presented in clashes between First Amendment and privacy rights counsels the Court to rely on limited principles that sweep no more broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case, rather than to accept invitations to hold broadly that truthful publication may never be punished consistent with the First Amendment or that publication of a rape victim's name never enjoys constitutional protection.  One such principle is that, ""if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public significance, then state officials may not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent a need to further a state interest of the highest order."" Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co.,   443 U. S. 97 ,   443 U. S. 103 .    Applied to the instant case, the  Daily Mail  principle commands reversal.  Pp.   491 U. S. 530 -536. (b) The Star ""lawfully obtain[ed] truthful information.""  The actual news article was accurate, and the Star lawfully obtained B.J.F.'s name from the government.  The fact that state officials are not required to disclose such reports or that the Sheriff's Department apparently failed to fulfill its § 794.03 obligation not to cause or allow B.J.F.'s name to be published does not make it unlawful for the Star to have received the information, and Florida has taken no steps to proscribe such receipt.  The government has ample means to safeguard the information that are less drastic than punishing truthful publication.  Furthermore, it is clear that the news article generally, as opposed to the specific identity contained in it, involved ""a matter of public significance"":  the commission, and investigation, of a violent crime that had been reported to authorities.  Pp.   491 U. S. 536 -537. (c) Imposing liability on the Star does not serve ""a need to further a state interest of the highest order.""  Although the interests in protecting the privacy and safety of sexual assault victims and in encouraging them to report offenses without fear of exposure are highly significant, imposing liability on the Star in this case is too precipitous a means of advancing those interests.  Since the Star obtained the information because the Sheriff's Department failed to abide by § 794.03's policy, the imposition of damages can hardly be said to be a narrowly tailored means of safeguarding anonymity.  Self-censorship is especially likely to result from imposition of liability when a newspaper gains access to the information from a government news release.  Moreover, the negligence  per se  standard adopted by the courts below does not permit case-by-case findings that the disclosure was one a reasonable person would find offensive, and does not have a scienter requirement of any kind.  In addition, § 794.03's facial underinclusiveness -- which prohibits publication only by an ""instrument of mass communication"" and does not prohibit the spread of victims' names by other means -- raises serious doubts about whether Florida is serving the interests specified by B.J.F.  A State must demonstrate its commitment to the extraordinary measure of punishing truthful publication in the name of privacy by applying its prohibition evenhandedly to both the small-time disseminator and the media giant.

 Syllabus   In 1984, respondent Oakes took color photographs of his partially nude and physically mature 14-year-old stepdaughter, L.S.  He was indicted, tried, and convicted of violating a Massachusetts statute (§ 29A) prohibiting adults from posing or exhibiting minors ""in a state of nudity"" for purposes of visual representation or reproduction in any publication, motion picture, photograph, or picture.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reversed the conviction.  After holding that Oakes' posing of L.S. was speech for First Amendment purposes, the court struck down the statute as substantially overbroad under the First Amendment without addressing whether § 29A could be constitutionally applied to Oakes.  It concluded that § 29A criminalized conduct that virtually every person would regard as lawful, such as the taking of family photographs of nude infants.  Subsequently, § 29A was amended to add a ""lascivious intent"" requirement to the ""nudity"" portion of the statute and to eliminate exemptions contained in the prior version. Held:   The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. 401 Mass. 602,  518 N.E.2d 836 , vacated and remanded."

 THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent was the unsuccessful challenger for the position of Municipal Judge of Hamilton, Ohio, in an election conducted on November 8, 1983.  A local newspaper, the Journal News, published by petitioner supported the reelection of the incumbent.  A little over a month before the election, the incumbent's Director of Court Services resigned and was arrested on bribery charges, and a grand jury investigation of those charges was in progress on November 1, 1983.  On that day, the Journal News ran a front-page story quoting a grand jury witness (Thompson) as stating that respondent had used ""dirty tricks"" and offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to Florida ""in appreciation"" for their help in the investigation.  Respondent filed a diversity action against petitioner for libel in Federal District Court, alleging that the story was false, had damaged his personal and professional reputation, and had been published with actual malice.  After listening to six days of testimony and three taped interviews -- one conducted by respondent and two by Journal News reporters -- and reviewing the contents of 56 exhibits, the jury was given instructions defining the elements of public figure libel and directed to answer three special verdicts.  It found by a preponderance of the evidence that the story in question was defamatory and false, and by clear and convincing proof that the story was published with actual malice, and awarded respondent $5,000 in compensatory damages and $195,000 in punitive damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It separately considered the evidence supporting each of the jury's special verdicts, concluding that neither the finding that the story was defamatory nor the finding that it was false was clearly erroneous.  In considering the actual malice issue, but without attempting to make an independent evaluation of the credibility of conflicting oral testimony concerning the subsidiary facts underlying the jury's finding of actual malice, the court identified 11 subsidiary facts that the jury ""could have"" found, and held that such findings would not have been clearly erroneous, and, based on its independent review, that, when considered cumulatively, they provided clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.  Held: 1. A showing of ""highly unreasonable conduct constituting an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers"" cannot alone support a verdict in favor of a public figure plaintiff in a libel action.  Rather, such a plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant published the false and defamatory material with actual malice,  i.e.,  with knowledge of falsity or with a reckless disregard for the truth.  Although there is language in the Court of Appeals' opinion suggesting that it applied the less severe professional standards rule, when read as a whole, it is clear that this language is merely supportive of the court's ultimate conclusion that the Journal News acted with actual malice.  Pp.   491 U. S. 663 -668. 2. A reviewing court in a public figure libel case must ""exercise independent judgment and determine whether the record establishes actual malice with convincing clarity"" to ensure that the verdict is consistent with the constitutional standard set out in  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , and subsequent decisions.   See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,   466 U. S. 485 .  Based on this Court's review of the entire record, the Court of Appeals properly held that the evidence did in fact support a finding of actual malice, but it should have taken a somewhat different approach in reaching that result.  While the jury may have found each of the 11 subsidiary facts, the case should have been decided on a less speculative ground.  Given the trial court's instructions, the jury's answers to the three special interrogatories, and an understanding of those facts not in dispute, it is evident that the jury must have rejected (1) the testimony of petitioner's witnesses that Thompson's sister, the most important witness to the bribery charges against the Director of Court Services, was not contacted simply because respondent failed to place her in touch with the newspaper; (2) the testimony of the editorial director of the Journal News that he did not listen to the taped interviews simply because he thought that they would provide him with no new information; and (3) the testimony of Journal News employees who asserted that they believed Thompson's allegations were substantially true.  When those findings are considered alongside the undisputed evidence, the conclusion that the newspaper acted with actual malice inextricably follows.  The evidence in the record in this case, when reviewed in its entirety, is ""unmistakably"" sufficient to support a finding of actual malice.  Pp.   491 U. S. 685 -693. 842 F.2d 825, affirmed.

 THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondent Rock Against Racism (RAR), furnishing its own sound equipment and technicians, has sponsored yearly programs of rock music at the Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell in New York City's Central Park.  The city received numerous complaints about excessive noise at RAR's concerts from users of the nearby Sheep Meadow, an area designated by the city for passive recreation, from other users of the park, and from residents of areas adjacent to the park.  Moreover, when the city shut off the power after RAR ignored repeated requests to lower the volume at one of its concerts, the audience became abusive and disruptive.  The city also experienced problems at bandshell events put on by other sponsors, who, due to their use of inadequate sound equipment or sound technicians unskilled at mixing sound for the bandshell area, were unable to provide sufficient amplification levels, resulting in disappointed or unruly audiences.  Rejecting various other solutions to the excessive noise and inadequate amplification problems, the city adopted a Use Guideline for the bandshell which specified that the city would furnish high quality sound equipment and retain an independent, experienced sound technician for all performances.  After the city implemented this guideline, RAR amended a preexisting District Court complaint against the city to seek damages and a declaratory judgment striking down the guideline as facially invalid under the First Amendment.  The court upheld the guideline, finding,  inter alia,  that performers who had used the city's sound system and technician had been uniformly pleased; that, although the city's technician ultimately controlled both sound volume and mix, the city's practice was to give the sponsor autonomy as to mix and to confer with him before turning the volume down; and that the city's amplification system was sufficient for RAR's needs.  Applying this Court's three-part test for judging the constitutionality of governmental regulation of the time, place, and manner of protected speech, the court found the guideline valid.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that such regulations' method and extent must be the least intrusive upon the freedom of expression as is reasonably necessary to achieve the regulations' purpose, finding that there were various less restrictive means by which the city could control excessive volume without also intruding on RAR's ability to control sound mix.  Held:   The city's sound-amplification guideline is valid under the First Amendment as a reasonable regulation of the place and manner of protected speech.  Pp.   491 U. S. 790 -803. (a) The guideline is content-neutral, since it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.  The city's principal justification -- the desire to control noise in order to retain the sedate character of the Sheep Meadow and other areas of the park and to avoid intrusion into residential areas -- has nothing to do with content.  The city's other justification, its interest in ensuring sound quality, does not render the guideline content-based as an attempt to impose subjective standards of acceptable sound mix on performers, since the city has expressly disavowed any such intent, and requires its technician to defer to the sponsor's wishes as to mix.  On the record below, the city's sound quality concern extends only to the clearly content-neutral goals of ensuring adequate amplification and avoiding volume problems associated with inadequate mix.  There is no merit to RAR's argument that the guideline is nonetheless invalid on its face because it places unbridled discretion in the hands of city enforcement officials.  Even granting the doubtful proposition that this claim falls within the narrow class of permissible facial challenges to allegedly unconstrained grants of regulatory authority, the claim nevertheless fails, since the guideline's own terms in effect forbid officials purposely to select an inadequate system or to vary sound quality or volume based on the performer's message.  Moreover, the city has applied a narrowing construction to the guideline by requiring officials to defer to sponsors on sound quality and confer with them as to volume problems, and by mandating that amplification be sufficient for the sound to reach all concert-ground listeners.  Pp.   491 U. S. 791 -796. (b) The guideline is narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests.  That the city has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from unwelcome and excessive noise, even in a traditional public forum such as the park, cannot be doubted.  Moreover, it has a substantial interest in ensuring the sufficiency of sound amplification at bandshell events in order to allow citizens to enjoy the benefits of the park, in light of the evidence that inadequate amplification had resulted in the inability of some audiences to hear performances.  The Court of Appeals erred in requiring the city to prove that the guideline was the least intrusive means of furthering these legitimate interests, since a ""less-restrictive-alternative analysis"" has never been -- and is here, again, specifically rejected as -- a part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place, or manner regulation.   See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,   468 U. S. 288 ,   468 U. S. 293 ;  Regan v. Time, Inc.,   468 U. S. 641 .  The requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial governmental interest that would be   achieved less effectively absent the regulation, and the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve that interest.  If these standards are met, courts should defer to the government's reasonable determination.  Here, the city's substantial interest in limiting sound volume is served in a direct and effective way by the requirement that its technician control the mixing board.  Absent this requirement, the city's interest would have been served less well, as is evidenced by the excessive noise complaints generated by RAR's past concerts.  The city also could reasonably have determined that, overall, its interest in ensuring that sound amplification was sufficient to reach all concert-ground listeners would be served less effectively without the guideline than with it, since, by providing competent technicians and adequate equipment, the city eliminated inadequate amplification problems that plagued some performers in the past.  Furthermore, in the absence of evidence that the guideline had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability of performers to achieve the quality of sound they desired, there is no merit to RAR's contention that the guideline is substantially broader than necessary to achieve the city's legitimate ends.  Pp.   491 U. S. 796 -802. (c) The guideline leaves open ample alternative channels of communication, since it does not attempt to ban any particular manner or type of expression at a given place and time.  Rather, it continues to permit expressive activity in the bandshell, and has no effect on the quantity or content of that expression beyond regulating the extent of amplification.  That the city's volume limitations may reduce to some degree the potential audience for RAR's speech is of no consequence, since there has been no showing that the remaining avenues of communication are inadequate.

 CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   Section 223(b) of the Communications Act of 1934,  as amended,  bans indecent as well as obscene interstate commercial telephone messages, commonly known as ""dial-a-porn.""  Under its predecessor provision -- which sought to restrict minors' access to dial-a-porn -- the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), after lengthy court proceedings, had promulgated regulations laying out means by which dial-a-porn sponsors could screen out underaged callers.  Sable Communications of California, which offers sexually oriented prerecorded telephone messages to callers both in and outside the Los Angeles metropolitan area, brought suit in the District Court, claiming that § 223(b)'s obscenity and indecency provisions were unconstitutional, chiefly under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeking an injunction enjoining the FCC and the Justice Department from initiating any criminal investigation or prosecution, civil action, or administrative proceeding under the statute and a declaratory judgment.  The court denied Sable's request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ban on obscene telephone messages, rejecting the argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it created a national standard of obscenity.  However, it issued the injunction with regard to the indecent speech provision, holding that the provision was overbroad and unconstitutional because it was not narrowly drawn to achieve the legitimate state interest of protecting children from exposure to indecent dial-a-porn messages. Held: 1. Section 223(b) does not unconstitutionally prohibit the interstate transmission of obscene commercial telephone messages.  The protection of the First Amendment does not extend to obscene speech.  In addition, § 223(b) does not contravene the ""contemporary community standards"" requirement of  Miller v. California,   413 U. S. 15 , since it no more establishes a ""national standard"" of obscenity than do federal statutes prohibiting the mailing of obscene materials or the broadcasting of   obscene messages.  There is no constitutional barrier under  Miller  to prohibiting communications that are obscene in some communities under local standards even though they are not obscene in others.  Sable which has the burden of complying with the prohibition, is free to tailor its messages, on a selective basis, to the communities it chooses to serve.  Pp.   492 U. S. 124 -126. 2. Section 223(b)'s ban on indecent telephone messages violates the First Amendment, since the statute's denial of adult access to such messages far exceeds that which is necessary to serve the compelling interest of preventing minors from being exposed to the messages.   FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,   438 U. S. 726 , an emphatically narrow ruling giving the FCC power to regulate an indecent radio broadcast, is readily distinguishable from this case.   Pacifica,  which did not involve a total ban on broadcasting indecent material, relied on the ""unique"" attributes of broadcasting, which can intrude on the privacy of the home without prior warning of content and which is uniquely accessible to children.  In contrast, the dial-it medium requires the listener to take affirmative steps to receive the communications.  The Government's argument that nothing less than a total ban could prevent children from gaining access to the messages and that this Court should defer to Congress' conclusions and factual findings to that effect is unpersuasive.  There is no evidence to show that children would have evaded the rules that the FCC, after prolonged proceedings, had determined would keep the messages out of their reach.  Moreover, deference to Congress' legislative findings cannot limit judicial inquiry where First Amendment rights are at stake.  Here, the congressional record contains no legislative findings that would justify a conclusion that there are no constitutionally acceptable less restrictive means to achieve the Government's interest in protecting minors.

 THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Resolution 66-156 of the State University of New York (SUNY) prohibits private commercial enterprises from operating in SUNY facilities.  After the resolution was applied by campus police to bar American Future Systems, Inc. (AFS), from demonstrating and selling its housewares at a party hosted in a student dormitory, respondent Fox and other students sued for a declaratory judgment that such action violated the First Amendment.  The District Court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the resolution but, after a trial, found for SUNY on the ground that its dormitories did not constitute a public forum for purposes of commercial activity, and that the restrictions on speech were reasonable in light of the dormitories' purpose.  Viewing the challenged application of the resolution as a restriction on commercial speech, and therefore applying the test articulated in  Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York,   447 U. S. 557 , the Court of Appeals concluded that it was unclear whether the resolution directly advanced the State's asserted interests and whether, if it did, it was the least restrictive means to that end.  The court therefore reversed and remanded to the trial court. Held: 1. The Court of Appeals erred in requiring the District Court to apply a least restrictive means test to Resolution 66-156.  Pp.   492 U. S. 473 -481. (a) The AFS parties the students seek to hold propose a commercial transaction, and therefore constitute commercial speech.  Although they also touch upon other subjects, such as how to be financially responsible and run an efficient home, this does not render them noncommercial in their entirety on the theory that fully protected, educational speech and commercial speech are ""inextricably intertwined.""   Riley v. National Federation of Blind of North Carolina, Inc.,   487 U. S. 781 , distinguished.  Pp.   492 U. S. 473 -475 (b) Although  Central Hudson  and other decisions have occasionally contained statements suggesting that government restrictions on commercial speech must constitute the least restrictive means of achieving the governmental interests asserted, those decisions have never required that the restriction be absolutely the least severe that will   achieve the desired end.  Rather, the decisions require only a reasonable ""fit"" between the government's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.   See, e.g., Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico,   478 U. S. 328 ,   478 U. S. 341 ;  In re R. M.J.,   455 U. S. 191 ,   455 U. S. 203 .  So long as the means are narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective, it is for governmental decisionmakers to judge what manner of regulation may be employed.  Pp.   492 U. S. 475 -481. 2. Respondents' overbreadth claim -- which is based on the assertion that Resolution 66-156 impermissibly prohibits their fully protected, noncommercial speech -- is not ripe for resolution in this Court.  Pp.   492 U. S. 481 -486. (a) Although overbreadth analysis does not normally apply to commercial speech, Resolution 66-156 must be deemed to reach some noncommercial speech in light of evidence that it prohibits for-profit job counseling, tutoring, legal advice, and medical consultation in students' dormitory rooms.  While such conduct consists of speech for profit, it does not satisfy the definition of commercial speech, since it does not propose a commercial transaction.  Pp.   492 U. S. 481 -482. (b) The overbreadth doctrine was designed as a departure from traditional rules of standing, enabling persons who are themselves unharmed by a statute to challenge it facially on the ground that it may be applied unconstitutionally to others, in situations not before the Court.   Broadrick v. Oklahoma,   413 U. S. 601 ,   413 U. S. 610 ,   413 U. S. 613 .  Respondents' invocation of the doctrine is unusual because the asserted extensions of Resolution 66-156 beyond commercial speech that are the basis for their challenge are not hypothetical applications to third parties, but applications to respondents themselves, which were part of the subject of the complaint and the testimony adduced at trial.  Nevertheless, there is no reason why the doctrine cannot be invoked in this situation.  Pp.   492 U.S. 482 -484. (c) However, an as-applied challenge should ordinarily be decided before an overbreadth claim, for reasons relating both to the proper functioning of courts and to their efficiency.  Here, neither of the courts below ever considered respondents' as-applied challenge under the proper legal standards, nor apparently even recognized that the case involves both commercial and noncommercial speech.  On remand, the question whether Resolution 66-156's alleged substantial overbreadth makes it unenforceable should be addressed only if it is first determined that its application to speech in either category is valid.

 Syllabus   This litigation concerns the constitutionality of two recurring holiday displays located on public property in downtown Pittsburgh.  The first, a creche depicting the Christian nativity scene, was placed on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse, which is the ""main,"" ""most beautiful,"" and ""most public"" part of the courthouse.  The creche was donated by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic group, and bore a sign to that effect.  Its manger had at its crest an angel bearing a banner proclaiming ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo,"" meaning ""Glory to God in the Highest.""  The second of the holiday displays in question was an 18-foot Chanukah menorah or candelabrum, which was placed just outside the City-County Building next to the city's 45-foot decorated Christmas tree.  At the foot of the tree was a sign bearing the mayor's name and containing text declaring the city's ""salute to liberty.""  The menorah is owned by Chabad, a Jewish group, but is stored, erected, and removed each year by the city.  Respondents, the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and seven local residents, filed suit seeking permanently to enjoin the county from displaying the creche and the city from displaying the menorah on the ground that the displays violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to state governments by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court denied relief, relying on  Lynch v. Donnelly,   465 U. S. 668 , which held that a city's inclusion of a creche in its annual Christmas display in a private park did not violate the Establishment Clause.  The Court of Appeals reversed, distinguishing  Lynch v. Donnelly  and holding that the creche and the menorah in the present case must be understood as an impermissible governmental endorsement of Christianity and Judaism under  Lemon v. Kurtzman,   403 U. S. 602 .  Held:   The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded. 842 F.2d 655, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded."

 THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   After petitioner university denied tenure to associate professor Rosalie Tung, she filed a charge with respondent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In the course of its investigation, the EEOC issued a subpoena seeking,  inter alia,  Tung's tenure-review file and the tenure files of five male faculty members identified in the charge as having received more favorable treatment than Tung.  Petitioner refused to produce a number of the tenure file documents and applied to the EEOC for modification of the subpoena to exclude what it termed ""confidential peer review information.""  The EEOC denied the application and successfully sought enforcement of the subpoena by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's claim that policy considerations and First Amendment principles of academic freedom required the recognition of a qualified privilege or the adoption of a balancing approach that would require the EEOC to demonstrate some particularized need, beyond a showing of relevance, to obtain peer review materials. Held:   A university does not enjoy a special privilege requiring a judicial finding of particularized necessity of access, beyond a showing of mere relevance, before peer review materials pertinent to charges of discrimination in tenure decisions are disclosed to the EEOC.    493 U. S.    188-202. (a) The claimed privilege cannot be grounded in the common law under Federal Rule of Evidence 501.  This Court is reluctant to recognize petitioner's asserted privilege where it appears that Congress, in expressly extending Title VII's coverage to educational institutions in 1972 and in thereafter continuing to afford the EEOC a broad right of access to any evidence ""relevant"" to a charge under investigation, balanced the substantial costs of invidious discrimination in institutions of higher learning against the importance of academic autonomy, but did not see fit to create a privilege for peer review documents.  In fact, Congress did provide a modicum of protection for an employer's interest in the confidentiality of its records by making it a crime for EEOC employees to publicize before the institution of court proceedings materials obtained during investigations.  Petitioner has not offered persuasive   justification for its claim that this Court should go further than Congress thought necessary to safeguard confidentiality.  Disclosure of peer review materials will often be necessary in order for the EEOC to determine whether illegal discrimination has taken place.  Moreover, the adoption of a requirement that the EEOC demonstrate a specific reason for disclosure, beyond a showing of relevance, would place a substantial litigation-producing obstacle in the EEOC's way and give universities a weapon to frustrate investigations.  It would also lead to a wave of similar privilege claims by other employers, such as writers, publishers, musicians, and lawyers, who play significant roles in furthering speech and learning in society.  Furthermore, petitioner's claim is not supported by this Court's precedents recognizing qualified privileges for Presidential and grand and petit jury communications and for deliberative intra-agency documents, since a privilege for peer review materials lacks a historical, constitutional, or statutory basis similar to that of those privileges.    493 U. S.    188-195. (b) Nor can the claimed privilege be grounded in First Amendment ""academic freedom.""  Petitioner's reliance on this Court's so-called academic freedom cases is somewhat misplaced, since, in invalidating various governmental actions, those cases dealt with attempts to control university speech that were  content-based  and that constituted a  direct  infringement on the asserted right to determine on academic grounds who could teach.  In contrast, petitioner here does not allege any content-based regulation, but only that the ""quality of instruction and scholarship [will] decline"" as a result of the burden EEOC subpoenas place on the peer review process.  The subpoena at issue does not provide criteria that petitioner  must  use in selecting teachers, or prevent it from using any such criteria other than those prescribed by Title VII, and therefore respects  legitimate  academic decisionmaking.  In any event, the First Amendment does not embrace petitioner's claim to the effect that the right of academic freedom derived from the cases relied on should be expanded to protect confidential peer review materials from disclosure.  By comparison with cases in which the Court has recognized a First Amendment right, the complained-of infringement is extremely attenuated, in that the burden of such disclosure is far removed from the asserted right, and, if petitioner's claim were accepted, many other generally applicable laws, such as tax laws, might be said to infringe the First Amendment to the extent they affected university hiring.  In addition, the claimed injury to academic freedom is speculative, since confidentiality is not the norm in all peer review systems, and since some disclosure of peer evaluations would take place even if the ""special necessity"" test were adopted.  Moreover, this Court will not assume that most evaluators will become less candid if the possibility of disclosure increases.    This case is in many respects similar to  Branzburg v. Hayes,   408 U. S. 665 , where, in rejecting the contention that the First Amendment prohibited requiring a reporter to testify as to information obtained in confidence without a special showing that such testimony was necessary, the Court declared that the Amendment does not invalidate every incidental burdening of the press that may result from the enforcement of generally applicable laws,  id.  at 682, and indicated a reluctance to recognize a constitutional privilege of uncertain effect and scope,  id.  at 693, 703.  Pp.   493 U. S. 195 -202. 850 F.2d 969 (CA3 1988), affirmed. BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."

 Syllabus   Respondent City of Dallas adopted a comprehensive ordinance regulating ""sexually oriented businesses,"" which are defined to include ""adult"" arcades, bookstores, video stores, cabarets, motels, and theaters, as well as escort agencies, nude model studios, and sexual encounter centers.  Among other things, the ordinance requires that such businesses be licensed, and includes civil disability provisions prohibiting certain individuals from obtaining licenses.  Three groups of individuals and businesses involved in the adult entertainment industry filed separate suits challenging the ordinance on numerous grounds and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  The District Court upheld the bulk of the ordinance, but struck down several subsections, and the city subsequently amended the ordinance in conformity with the court's judgment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding,  inter alia,  that the ordinance's licensing scheme did not violate the First Amendment despite its failure to provide the procedural safeguards set forth in  Freedman v. Maryland,   380 U. S. 51  (1965), and that its civil disability provisions and its provision requiring licensing for ""adult motel owners"" renting rooms for fewer than 10 hours were constitutional. Held:   The judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part, and the cases are remanded. 837 F.2d 1298, (CA 51988), affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded."

 FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT
 Syllabus   California law requires retailers to pay a 6% sales tax on in-state sales of tangible personal property and to collect from state residents a 6% use tax on such property purchased outside the State.  During the tax period in question, appellant religious organization, which is incorporated in Louisiana, sold a variety of religious materials at ""evangelistic crusades"" within California and made mail-order sales of other such materials to California residents.  Appellee State Board of Equalization (Board) audited appellant and advised it that it should register as a seller as required by state law and report and pay sales and use taxes on the aforementioned sales.  Appellant paid the taxes and the Board ruled against it on its petitions for redetermination and refund, rejecting its contention that the tax on religious materials violated the First Amendment.  The state trial court entered judgment for the Board in appellant's refund suit, the State Court of Appeal affirmed, and the State Supreme Court denied discretionary review. Held: 1. California's imposition of sales and use tax liability on appellant's sales of religious materials does not contravene the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.  Pp.   493 U. S. 384 -397. (a) The collection and payment of the tax imposes no constitutionally significant burden on appellant's religious practices or beliefs under the Free Exercise Clause, which accordingly does not require the State to grant appellant a tax exemption.  Appellant misreads  Murdock v. Pennsylvania,   319 U. S. 105 , and  Follett v. McCormick,   321 U. S. 573 , which, although holding flat license taxes on commercial sales unconstitutional with regard to the evangelical distribution of religious materials, nevertheless specifically stated that religious activity may constitutionally be subjected to a generally applicable income or property tax akin to the California tax at issue.  Those cases apply only where a flat license tax operates as a prior restraint on the free exercise of religious belief.  As such, they do not invalidate California's generally applicable sales and use tax, which is not a flat tax, represents only a small fraction of any sale, and applies neutrally to all relevant sales regardless of the nature of the seller or purchaser, so that there is no danger that appellant's   religious activity is being singled out for special and burdensome treatment.  Moreover, the concern in  Murdock  and  Follett  that flat license taxes operate as a precondition to the exercise of evangelistic activity is not present here, because the statutory registration requirement and the tax itself do not act as prior restraints -- no fee is charged for registering, the tax is due regardless of preregistration, and the tax is not imposed as a precondition of disseminating the message.  Furthermore, since appellant argues that the exercise of its beliefs is unconstitutionally burdened by the reduction in its income resulting from the presumably lower demand for its wares (caused by the marginally higher price generated by the tax) and from the costs associated with administering the tax, its free exercise claim is in significant tension with  Hernandez v. Commissioner,   490 U. S. 680 ,   490 U. S. 699 , which made clear that, to the extent that imposition of a generally applicable tax merely decreases the amount of money appellant has to spend on its religious activities, any such burden is not constitutionally significant because it is no different from that imposed by other generally applicable laws and regulations to which religious organizations must adhere.  While a more onerous tax rate than California's, even if generally applicable, might effectively choke off an adherent's religious practices, that situation is not before, or considered by, this Court.  Pp.   493 U. S. 384 -392. (b) Application of the California tax to appellant's sale of religious materials does not violate the Establishment Clause by fostering an excessive governmental entanglement with religion.  The evidence of administrative entanglement is thin, since the Court of Appeal expressly found that, in light of appellant's sophisticated accounting staff and computerized accounting methods, the record did not support its assertion that the collection and payment of the tax impose severe accounting burdens on it.  Moreover, although collection and payment will require some contact between appellant and the State, generally applicable administrative and recordkeeping burdens may be imposed on religious organizations without running afoul of the Clause.   See e.g., Hernandez, supra,  at   490 U. S. 696 -697.  The fact that appellant must bear the cost of collecting and remitting the tax -- even if the financial burden may vary from religion to religion -- does not enmesh the government in religious affairs, since the statutory scheme requires neither the involvement of state employees in, nor on-site continuing inspection of, appellant's day-to-day operations.  Most significantly, the imposition of the tax without an exemption for appellant does not require the State to inquire into the religious content of the items sold or the religious motivation for selling or purchasing them, since they are subject to the tax regardless of content or motive.  Pp.   493 U. S. 392 -397.  2. The merits of appellant's Commerce and Due Process Clause claim are not properly before, and will not be reached by, this Court, since both the trial court and the Court of Appeal ruled that the claim was procedurally barred because it was not presented to the Board as required by state law.   See, e.g., Michigan v. Long,   463 U. S. 1032 ,   463 U. S. 1041 -1042.  Appellant has failed to substantiate any claim that the California courts in general apply the procedural bar rule and a pertinent exception in an irregular, arbitrary, or inconsistent manner.  Pp.   493 U. S. 397 -399. 204 Cal. App. 3d 1269 ,  250 Cal. Rptr. 891 , affirmed. O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."

 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   A group of lawyers in private practice who regularly acted as court-appointed counsel for indigent defendants in District of Columbia criminal cases agreed at a meeting of the Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association (SCTLA) to stop providing such representation until the District increased group members' compensation.  The boycott had a severe impact on the District's criminal justice system, and the District government capitulated to the lawyers' demands.  After the lawyers returned to work, petitioner Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against SCTLA and four of its officers (respondents), alleging that they had entered into a conspiracy to fix prices and to conduct a boycott that constituted unfair methods of competition in violation of § 5 of the FTC Act.  Declining to accept the conclusion of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that the complaint should be dismissed, the FTC ruled that the boycott was illegal  per se  and entered an order prohibiting respondents from initiating future such boycotts.  The Court of Appeals, although acknowledging that the boycott was a ""classic restraint of trade"" in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, vacated the FTC order.  Noting that the boycott was meant to convey a political message to the public, the court concluded that it contained an element of expression warranting First Amendment protection and that, under  United States v. O'Brien,   391 U. S. 367 , an incidental restriction on such expression could not be justified unless it was no greater than was essential to an important governmental interest.  Reasoning that this test could not be satisfied by the application of an otherwise appropriate  per se  rule, but instead requires the enforcement agency to prove rather than presume that the evil against which the antitrust laws are directed looms in the conduct it condemns, the court remanded for a determination whether respondents possessed ""significant market power.""  Held: 1. Respondents' boycott constituted a horizontal arrangement among competitors that was unquestionably a naked restraint of price and output in violation of the antitrust laws.  Respondents' proffered social justifications for the restraint of trade do not make the restraint any less unlawful.  Nor is respondents' agreement outside the coverage of the antitrust laws under  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.,   365 U. S. 127 , simply because its objective was the enactment of favorable legislation.  The  Noerr  doctrine does not extend to horizontal boycotts designed to exact higher prices from the government simply because they are genuinely intended to influence the government to agree to the conspirators' terms.   Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc.,   486 U. S. 492 ,   486 U. S. 503 .    493 U. S.    421-425. 2. Respondents' boycott is not immunized from antitrust regulation by  NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.,   458 U. S. 886 , which held that the First Amendment prevented a State from prohibiting a politically motivated civil rights boycott.  Unlike the boycott upheld in  Claiborne Hardware,  the undenied objective of this boycott was to gain an economic advantage for those who agreed to participate.  458 U.S. at   458 U. S. 914 -915.    493 U. S.    425-428. 3. The Court of Appeals erred in creating a new exception, based on  O'Brien, supra,  to the antitrust  per se  liability rules for boycotts having an expressive component.  The court's analysis is critically flawed in at least two respects.  First, it exaggerates the significance of the ""expressive component"" in respondents' boycott, since every concerted refusal to do business with a potential customer or supplier has such a component.  Thus, a rule requiring courts to apply the antitrust laws ""prudently and with sensitivity,"" in the Court of Appeals' words, whenever an economic boycott has an ""expressive component"" would create a gaping hole in the fabric of those laws.  Second, the Court of Appeals' analysis denigrates the importance of the rule of law that respondents violated.  The court's implicit assumption that the antitrust laws permit, but do not require, the condemnation of price fixing and boycotts without proof of market power is in error, since, although the  per se  rules are the product of judicial interpretation of the Sherman Act, they nevertheless have the same force and effect as any other statutory commands.  The court also erred in assuming that the categorical antitrust prohibitions are ""only"" rules of ""administrative convenience"" that do not serve any substantial governmental interest unless the price-fixing competitors actually possess market power.  The  per se  rules reflect a longstanding judgment that every horizontal price-fixing arrangement among competitors poses some threat to the free market, even if the participants   do not themselves have the power to control market prices.

 Syllabus   When respondent Smith, a reporter, testified before a state grand jury about alleged improprieties committed by certain public officials, he was warned that, if he revealed his testimony in any manner, he would be subject to criminal prosecution under Fla.Stat. § 905.27, which prohibits,  inter alios,  a witness from ever disclosing testimony given before a grand jury.  After the grand jury terminated its investigation, Smith -- who wanted to write about the investigation's subject matter, including,  inter alia,  his grand jury testimony -- filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that § 905.27 was an unconstitutional abridgment of speech and an injunction preventing the State from prosecuting him.  The court granted summary judgment to the State, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that § 905.27 is unconstitutional to the extent that it applies to witnesses who speak about their own testimony after the grand jury investigation is terminated. Held:   Section 905.27 violates the First Amendment insofar as it prohibits a grand jury witness from disclosing his own testimony after the grand jury's term has ended.  Pp.   494 U. S. 629 -636. (a) To determine the validity of Florida's ban, the State's interests in preserving the confidentiality of its grand jury proceedings must be balanced against Smith's asserted First Amendment rights.   See Landmark Communications Inc. v. Virginia,   435 U. S. 829 ,   435 U. S. 838 .   Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,   467 U. S. 20  -- which held that a protective order prohibiting a newspaper from publishing information which it had obtained through discovery procedures did not offend the First Amendment -- does not govern the validity of Florida's ban, since the instant case deals with divulging information that was in a witness' possession before he testified before the grand jury, not information he may have obtained from his participation in those proceedings.  State officials may not constitutionally punish publication of lawfully obtained truthful information about a matter of public importance absent a need to further a state interest of the highest order.  Pp.   494 U. S. 629 -632. (b) Florida's interests in preserving grand jury secrecy either are not served by, or are insufficient to warrant, its ban.  Once an investigation ends, there is no need to keep information from the targeted individual   to prevent his escape, since he will have been either exonerated or charged.  Nor is there a need to prevent the importuning of grand jurors whose deliberations will be over.  Similarly, the concern that some witnesses will be deterred from presenting testimony due to fears about retribution is not advanced by the ban, since any witness is free not to divulge his own testimony, and since the part of § 905.27 that prohibits a witness from disclosing the testimony of another witness remains enforceable.  While Florida's interest in preventing the subornation of grand jury witnesses who will later testify at trial is served by the ban to the extent that the accused will have an additional opportunity to learn of the witness' existence, its effect is marginal, at best, and insufficient to outweigh the First Amendment interest involved.  With present day criminal procedure generally requiring disclosure of witnesses by the State, the witness' name will be available to the accused before trial anyway.  In addition, Florida has substantial criminal penalties for both perjury and witness tampering, and its courts have subpoena and contempt powers available to bring recalcitrant witnesses to the stand.  Although Florida has a substantial interest in seeing that persons who are exonerated will not be held up to public ridicule, that interest alone cannot justify the proscription of truthful speech, absent exceptional circumstances.  Pp.   494 U. S. 632 -634. (c) The fact that neither the drafters of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, nor the drafters of similar rules in the majority of the States, found it necessary to impose an obligation of secrecy on grand jury witnesses to protect any of the interests asserted by Florida is probative of the weight to be assigned those interests and the extent to which the ban in question is necessary to further them.  Pp.   494 U. S. 634 -635. (d) The ban's impact on Smith's ability to make a truthful public statement is dramatic.  Here, Smith, who before testifying was free to speak about information he possessed on matters of admitted public concern, believes that he is no longer free to communicate this information.  The potential for abuse of the ban, through its employment as a device to silence those who know of unlawful conduct or irregularities on the part of public officials, is apparent.  Pp.   494 U. S. 635 -636. 866 F.2d 1318, affirmed. REHNQUIST, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  SCALIA, J., filed a concurring opinion,  post,  p. 636. "

Michigan Chamber of Commerce No. 88-1569 Argued Oct. 31, 1989 Decided March 27, 1990 494 U.S. 652 Syllabus   Appellee Michigan State Chamber of Commerce is a nonprofit corporation, whose bylaws set forth both political and nonpolitical purposes.  Its general treasury is funded through annual dues required of all members, three-quarters of whom are for-profit corporations.  Section 54(1) of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act prohibits corporations, excluding media corporations, from using general treasury funds for,  inter alia,  independent expenditures in connection with state candidate elections.  However, they may make such expenditures from segregated funds used solely for political purposes.  Because the Chamber wished to use general treasury funds to place a local newspaper advertisement in support of a specific candidate for state office, it brought suit in the Federal District Court for injunctive relief against § 54(1)'s enforcement, arguing that the expenditure restrictions are unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The court upheld the section, but the Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that, as applied to the Chamber, § 54(1) violated the First Amendment. Held: 1. Section 54(1) does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.   494 U. S. 657 -666. (a) Although § 54(1)'s requirements burden the Chamber's exercise of political expression,  see FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,   479 U. S. 238 ,   479 U. S. 252  ( MCFL ), they are justified by a compelling state interest:  preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in the political arena by reducing the threat that huge corporate treasuries, which are amassed with the aid of favorable state laws and have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas, will be used to influence unfairly election outcomes.  Pp.   494 U. S. 657 -660 (b) Section 54(1) is sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve its goal, because it is precisely targeted to eliminate the distortion caused by corporate spending while also allowing corporations to express their political views by making expenditures through separate segregated funds.  Because persons who contribute to segregated funds understand that their money will be used solely for political purposes, the speech generated accurately reflects contributors' support for the corporation's political views.  The fact that § 54(1) covers closely held corporations that   do not possess vast reservoirs of capital does not make it substantially overinclusive, because all corporations receive the special benefits conferred by the corporate form and thus present the potential for distorting the political process.   Cf. FEC v. National Right to Work Committee,   459 U. S. 197 ,   459 U. S. 209 -210.  Pp.   494 U. S. 660 -661. (c) There is no merit to the Chamber's argument that, even if § 54(1) is constitutional with respect to for-profit corporations, it cannot be applied to a nonprofit ideological corporation such as itself.  The Chamber does not exhibit the crucial features identified in  MCFL, supra,  that would require the State to exempt it from independent spending burdens as a nonprofit corporation more akin to a voluntary political association than a business firm.   MCFL's  narrow focus on the promotion of political ideas ensured that its resources reflected political support, while the Chamber's more varied bylaws do not.  Additionally, unlike  MCFL  members, the Chamber's members are similar to shareholders -- who have an economic disincentive for disassociating with a corporation even if they disagree with its political activity -- in that they may be reluctant to withdraw from the Chamber because they wish to benefit from its nonpolitical programs and to establish contacts with other members of the business community.  Also in contrast to MCFL, which took no contributions from business corporations, more than three-quarters of the Chamber's members are business corporations, whose political contributions and expenditures can constitutionally be regulated by the State, and who thus could circumvent § 54(1)'s restrictions by funneling money through the Chamber's general treasury.  Pp.   494 U. S. 661 -665. (d) Section 54(1) is not rendered under-inclusive by its failure to regulate the independent expenditures of unincorporated labor unions that also have the capacity to accumulate wealth, because the exclusion does not undermine the State's compelling interest in regulating corporations whose unique form enhances such capacity.  Moreover, because members who disagree with a union's political activities can decline to contribute to them without giving up other membership benefits, a union's political funds more accurately reflect members' support for the organization's political views than does a corporation's general treasury.  Pp.   494 U. S. 665 -666. 2. Section 54(1) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth. Amendment.  Even under strict scrutiny, its classifications pass muster.  The State's decision to regulate corporations and not unincorporated associations is precisely tailored to serve its compelling interest.  Similarly, the exemption of media corporations does not render the section unconstitutional.  Restrictions on the expenditures of corporations whose resources are devoted to the collection and dissemination of information to the public might discourage news broadcasters or   publishers from serving their crucial societal role of reporting on and publishing editorials about newsworthy events; thus, their exemption from the section's restrictions is justified.

 Syllabus   Respondents Smith and Black were fired by a private drug rehabilitation organization because they ingested peyote, a hallucinogenic drug, for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of their Native American Church.  Their applications for unemployment compensation were denied by the State of Oregon under a state law disqualifying employees discharged for work-related ""misconduct.""  Holding that the denials violated respondents' First Amendment free exercise rights, the State Court of Appeals reversed.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, but this Court vacated the judgment and remanded for a determination whether sacramental peyote use is proscribed by the State's controlled substance law, which makes it a felony to knowingly or intentionally possess the drug.  Pending that determination, the Court refused to decide whether such use is protected by the Constitution.  On remand, the State Supreme Court held that sacramental peyote use violated, and was not excepted from, the state law prohibition, but concluded that that prohibition was invalid under the Free Exercise Clause. Held:   The Free Exercise Clause permits the State to prohibit sacramental peyote use, and thus to deny unemployment benefits to persons discharged for such use.  Pp.   494 U. S. 876 -890. (a) Although a State would be ""prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]"" in violation of the Clause if it sought to ban the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts solely because of their religious motivation, the Clause does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a law that incidentally forbids (or requires) the performance of an act that his religious belief requires (or forbids) if the law is not specifically directed to religious practice and is otherwise constitutional as applied to those who engage in the specified act for nonreligious reasons.   See, e.g., Reynolds v. United States,   98 U. S. 145 ,   98 U. S. 166 -167.  The only decisions in which this Court has held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action are distinguished on the ground that they involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but that Clause in conjunction with other constitutional   protections.  See, e.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut,   310 U. S. 296 ,   310 U. S. 304 -307;  Wisconsin v. Yoder,   406 U. S. 205 .  Pp.   494 U. S. 876 -882. (b) Respondents' claim for a religious exemption from the Oregon law cannot be evaluated under the balancing test set forth in the line of cases following  Sherbert v. Verner,   374 U. S. 398 ,   374 U. S. 402 -403, whereby governmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified by a ""compelling governmental interest.""  That test was developed in a context -- unemployment compensation eligibility rules -- that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.  The test is inapplicable to an across-the-board criminal prohibition on a particular form of conduct.  A holding to the contrary would create an extraordinary right to ignore generally applicable laws that are not supported by ""compelling governmental interest"" on the basis of religious belief.  Nor could such a right be limited to situations in which the conduct prohibited is ""central"" to the individual's religion, since that would enmesh judges in an impermissible inquiry into the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith.   Cf. Hernandez v. Commissioner,   490 U. S. 680 ,   490 U. S. 699 .  Thus, although it is constitutionally permissible to exempt sacramental peyote use from the operation of drug laws, it is not constitutionally required.  Pp.   494 U.

Ohio No. 88-5986 Argued Dec. 5, 1989 Decided April 18, 1990 495 U.S. 103 APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO
 Syllabus   After Ohio police found photographs in petitioner Osborne's home, each of which depicted a nude male adolescent posed in sexually explicit position, he was convicted of violating a state statute prohibiting any person from possessing or viewing any material or performance showing a minor who is not his child or ward in a state of nudity unless (a) the material or performance is presented for a bona fide purpose by or to a person having a proper interest therein, or (b) the possessor knows that the minor's parents or guardian has consented in writing to such photographing or use of the minor.  An intermediate appellate court and the State Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.  The latter court rejected Osborne's contention that the First Amendment prohibits the States from proscribing the private possession of child pornography.  The court also found that the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad, since, in light of its specific exceptions, it must be read as only applying to depictions of nudity involving a lewd exhibition or graphic focus on the minor's genitals, and since scienter is an essential element of the offense.  In rejecting Osborne's contention that the trial court erred in not requiring the government to prove lewd exhibition and scienter as elements of his crime, the court emphasized that he had not objected to the jury instructions given at his trial, and stated that the failures of proof did not amount to plain error. Held: 1. Ohio may constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography.  Even assuming that Osborne has a valid First Amendment interest in such activities, this case is distinct from  Stanley v. Georgia,   394 U. S. 557 , which struck down a Georgia law outlawing the private possession of obscene material on the ground that the State's justifications for the law -- primarily, that obscenity would poison the minds of its viewers -- were inadequate.  In contrast, Ohio does not rely on a paternalistic interest in regulating Osborne's mind, but has enacted its law on the basis of its compelling interests in protecting the physical and psychological wellbeing of minors and in destroying the market for the exploitative use of children by penalizing those who possess and view the offending materials.   See New York v. Ferber,   458 U. S. 747 ,   458 U. S. 756 -758,   458 U. S. 761 -762.  Moreover, Ohio's ban encourages possessors to destroy such materials, which permanently record the victim's abuse and thus   may haunt him for years to come,  see id.  at 759, and which, available evidence suggests, may be used by pedophiles to seduce other children.  Pp.   495 U. S. 108 -111. 2. Osborne's First Amendment overbreadth arguments are unpersuasive.  Pp.   495 U. S. 111 -122. (a) The Ohio statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad.  Although, on its face, the statute purports to prohibit constitutionally protected depictions of nudity, it is doubtful that any overbreadth would be ""substantial"" under this Court's cases, in light of the statutory exemptions and ""proper purposes"" provisions.  In any event, the statute, as construed by the Ohio Supreme Court, plainly survives overbreadth scrutiny.  By limiting the statute's operation to nudity that constitutes lewd exhibition or focuses on genitals, that court avoided penalizing persons for viewing or possessing innocuous photographs of naked children, and thereby rendered the ""nudity"" language permissible.   See Ferber, supra,  at   458 U. S. 765 .  Moreover, the statute's failure, on its face, to provide a  mens rea  requirement is cured by the court's conclusion that the State must establish scienter under the Ohio default statute specifying that recklessness applies absent a statutory intent provision.  Pp.   495 U. S. 111 -115. (b) It was not impermissible for the State Supreme Court to rely on its narrowed construction of the statute when evaluating Osborne's overbreadth claim.  A statute as construed may be applied to conduct occurring before the construction, provided such application affords fair warning to the defendant.  See, e.g., Dombrowski v. Pfister,   380 U. S. 479 ,   380 U. S. 491 , n. 7.  It is obvious from the face of the child pornography statute, and from its placement within the ""Sexual Offenses"" chapter of the Ohio Code, that Osborne had notice that his possession of the photographs at issue was proscribed.   Bouie v. City of Columbia,   378 U. S. 347 ;  Rabe v. Washington,   405 U. S. 313 ; and  Marks v. United States,   430 U. S. 188 , distinguished.   Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham,   382 U. S. 87  -- which stands for the proposition that, where a State Supreme Court narrows an unconstitutionally overbroad statute, the State must ensure that defendants are convicted under the statute as it is subsequently construed, and not as it was originally written -- does not conflict with the holding in this case.  Nor does  Massachusetts v. Oakes,   491 U. S. 576  -- in which five Justices agreed in a separate opinion that a state legislature could not cure a potential overbreadth problem through a postconviction statutory amendment -- support Osborne's view that an overbroad statute is void as written, such that a court may not narrow it, affirm a conviction on the basis of the narrowing construction, and leave the statute in full force.  Since courts routinely adopt the latter course, acceptance of Osborne's proposition would require a radical reworking of American law.    Moreover, the  Oakes  approach is based on the fear that legislators, who know they can cure their own mistakes by amendment without significant cost, may not be careful to avoid drafting overbroad laws in the first place.  A similar effect will not be likely if a judicial construction of a statute to eliminate overbreadth is allowed to be applied in the case before the Court, since legislatures cannot be sure that the statute, when examined by a court, will be saved by a narrowing construction rather than invalidated for overbreadth, and since applying even a narrowed statute to pending cases might be barred by the Due Process Clause.  Furthermore, requiring that statutes be facially invalidated whenever overbreadth is perceived would very likely invite reconsideration or redefinition of the overbreadth doctrine in a way that would not serve First Amendment interests.  Pp.   495 U. S. 115 -122. 3. Nevertheless, due process requires that Osborne's conviction be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, since it is unclear whether the conviction was based on a finding that the State had proved each of the elements of the offense.  It is true that this Court is precluded from reaching the due process challenge with respect to the scienter element of the crime, because counsel's failure to comply with the state procedural rule requiring an objection to faulty jury instructions constitutes an independent state law ground adequate to support the result below.  However, this Court is not so barred with respect to counsel's failure to object to the failure to instruct on lewdness, since, shortly before the brief trial, counsel moved to dismiss on the ground that the statute was overbroad in its failure to allow the viewing of innocent nude photographs.  Nothing would be gained by requiring counsel to object a second time, specifically to the jury instructions.  The assertion of federal rights, when plainly and reasonably made, may not be defeated under the name of local practice.   Cf. Douglas v. Alabama,   380 U. S. 415 ,   380 U. S. 421 -422.

State Bar of California No. 88-1905 Argued Feb. 27, 1990 Decided June 4, 1990 496 U.S. 1 CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA
 Syllabus   Respondent State Bar of California is an ""integrated bar"" --  i.e.,  an association of attorneys in which membership and dues are required as a condition of practicing law -- created under state law to regulate the State's legal profession.  In fulfilling its broad statutory mission to ""promote the improvement of the administration of justice,"" the Bar uses its membership dues for self-regulatory functions, such as formulating rules of professional conduct and disciplining members for misconduct.  It also uses dues to lobby the legislature and other governmental agencies, file  amicus curiae,  briefs in pending cases, hold an annual delegates conference for the debate of current issues and the approval of resolutions, and engage in educational programs.  Petitioners, State Bar members, brought suit in state court claiming that, through these latter activities, the Bar expends mandatory dues payments to advance political and ideological causes to which they do not subscribe, in violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.  They requested,  inter alia,  an injunction restraining the Bar from using mandatory dues or its name to advance political and ideological causes or beliefs.  The court granted summary judgment to the Bar on the grounds that it is a governmental agency, and therefore permitted under the First Amendment to engage in the challenged activities.  The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that, while the Bar's regulatory activities were similar to those of a government agency, its ""administration-of-justice"" functions were more akin to the activities of a labor union.  Relying on the analysis of  Abood v. Detroit Bd. of     Education,   431 U. S. 209  -- which prohibits the agency-shop dues of dissenting nonunion employees from being used to support political and ideological union causes that are unrelated to collective bargaining activities -- the court held that the Bar's activities could be financed from mandatory dues only if a particular action served a state interest important enough to overcome the interference with dissenters' First Amendment rights.  The State Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that the Bar was a ""government agency"" that could use its dues for any purpose within the scope of its statutory authority, and that subjecting the Bar's activities to First Amendment scrutiny would place an ""extraordinary burden"" on its statutory mission.  With the exception of certain election campaigning, the court found that all of the challenged activities fell within the Bar's statutory authority. Held: 1. The State Bar's use of petitioners' compulsory dues to finance political and ideological activities with which petitioners disagree violates their First Amendment right of free speech when such expenditures are not necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or improving the quality of legal services.  Pp.   496 U. S. 9 -17. (a) The State Supreme Court's determination that the State Bar is a ""government agency"" for the purposes of state law is not binding on this Court when such a determination is essential to the decision of a federal question.  The State Bar is not a typical ""government agency.""  The Bar's principal funding comes from dues levied on its members, rather than from appropriations made by the legislature; its membership is composed solely of lawyers admitted to practice in the State, and its services by way of governance of the profession are essentially advisory in nature, since the ultimate responsibility of such governance is reserved by state law to the State Supreme Court.  By contrast, there is a substantial analogy between the relationship of the Bar and its members and that of unions and their members.  Just as it is appropriate that employees who receive the benefit of union negotiation with their employer pay their fair share of the cost of that process by paying agency-shop dues, it is entirely appropriate that lawyers who derive benefit from the status of being admitted to practice before the courts should be called upon to pay a fair share of the cost of the professional involvement in this effort.  The State Bar was created, not to participate in the general government of the State, but to provide specialized professional advice to those with the ultimate responsibility of governing the legal profession.  These differences between the State Bar and traditional government agencies render unavailing respondent's argument that it is not subject to the same constitutional rule with respect to the use of compulsory dues as are labor unions.  Pp.   496 U. S. 10 -13.  (b)  Abood  cannot be distinguished on the ground that the compelled association in the context of labor unions serves only a private economic interest in collective bargaining, while the Bar serves more substantial public interests.  In fact, the legislative recognition that the agency-shop arrangements serve vital national interests in preserving industrial peace indicates that they serve a substantial public interest as well.  It is not possible to determine that the Bar's interests outweigh these other interests sufficiently to produce a different result here.  P.   496 U. S. 13 . (c) The guiding standard for determining permissible Bar expenditures relating to political or ideological activities is whether the challenged expenditures are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or improving the quality of legal services.  Precisely where the line falls between permissible and impermissible dues-financed activities will not always be easy to discern.  But the extreme ends of the spectrum are clear:  Compulsory dues may not be used to endorse or advance a gun control or nuclear weapons freeze initiative, but may be spent on activities connected with disciplining Bar members or proposing the profession's ethical codes.  Pp.   496 U. S. 13 -16. (d) Since the Bar is already required to submit detailed budgets to the state legislature before obtaining approval to set annual dues, the State Supreme Court's assumption that complying with  Abood  would create an extraordinary burden for the Bar is unpersuasive.  Any burden that might result is insufficient to justify contravention of a constitutional mandate, and unions have operated successfully within the boundaries of  Abood  procedures for over a decade.  An integrated bar could meet its  Abood  obligation by adopting the sort of procedures described in  Teacher v. Hudson,   475 U. S. 292 .  Questions whether alternate procedures would also satisfy the obligation should be left for consideration upon a more fully developed record.  Pp.   496 U. S. 16 -17. 2. Petitioners' freedom of association claim based on the State Bar's use of its name to advance political and ideological causes or beliefs will not be addressed by this Court in the first instance.  P.   496 U. S. 17 . 47 Cal. 3d 1152 ,  255 Cal. Rptr. 542 ,  767 P.2d 1020  (1989), reversed and remanded. REHNQUIST, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. "

 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Westside High School, a public secondary school that receives federal financial assistance, permits its students to join, on a voluntary basis, a number of recognized groups and clubs, all of which meet after school hours on school premises.  Citing the Establishment Clause and a School Board policy requiring clubs to have faculty sponsorship, petitioner school officials denied the request of respondent Mergens for permission to form a Christian club that would have the same privileges and meet on the same terms and conditions as other Westside student groups, except that it would have no faculty sponsor.  After the Board voted to uphold the denial, respondents, current and former Westside students, brought suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  They alleged,  inter alia,  that the refusal to permit the proposed club to meet at Westside violated the Equal Access Act, which prohibits public secondary schools that receive federal assistance and that maintain a ""limited open forum"" from denying ""equal access"" to students who wish to meet within the forum on the basis of the ""religious, political, philosophical, or other content"" of the speech at such meetings.  In reversing the District Court's entry of judgment for petitioners, the Court of Appeals held that the Act applied to forbid discrimination against respondents' proposed club on the basis of its religious content, and that the Act did not violate the Establishment Clause. Held:   The judgment is affirmed. 867 F.2d 1076 (CA8 1989), affirmed."

 OF COLUMBIA
 Syllabus   After this Court held, in  Texas v. Johnson,   491 U. S. 397 , that a Texas statute criminalizing desecration of the United States flag in a way that the actor knew would seriously offend onlookers was unconstitutional as applied to an individual who had burned a flag during a political protest, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989.  The Act criminalizes the conduct of anyone who ""knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon"" a United States flag, except conduct related to the disposal of a ""worn or soiled"" flag.  Subsequently, appellees were prosecuted in the District Courts for violating the Act:  some for knowingly burning several flags while protesting various aspects of the Government's policies and others, in a separate incident, for knowingly burning a flag while protesting the Act's passage.  In each case, appellees moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the Act violates the First Amendment.  Both District Courts, following  Johnson, supra,  held the Act unconstitutional as applied, and dismissed the charges. Held:   Appellees' prosecution for burning a flag in violation of the Act is inconsistent with the First Amendment.  The Government concedes, as it must, that appellees' flag-burning constituted expressive conduct, and this Court declines to reconsider its rejection in  Johnson  of the claim that flag-burning as a mode of expression does not enjoy the First Amendment's full protection.  It is true that this Act, unlike the Texas law, contains no explicit content-based limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the Government's asserted interest in protecting the ""physical integrity"" of a privately owned flag in order to preserve the flag's status as a symbol of the Nation and certain national ideals is related to the suppression, and concerned with the content, of free expression.  The mere destruction or disfigurement of a symbol's physical manifestation does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself.  The Government's interest is implicated only when a person's treatment of the flag communicates a message to others that is inconsistent with the identified ideals.  The precise language of the Act's   prohibitions confirms Congress' interest in the communicative impact of flag destruction, since each of the specified terms -- with the possible exception of ""burns"" -- unmistakably connotes disrespectful treatment of the flag and suggests a focus on those acts likely to damage the flag's symbolic value, and since the explicit exemption for disposal of ""worn or soiled"" flags protects certain acts traditionally associated with patriotic respect for the flag.  Thus, the Act suffers from the same fundamental flaw as the Texas law, and its restriction on expression cannot "" be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,'""  Boos v. Barry,   485 U. S. 312 ,   485 U. S. 320 .  It must therefore be subjected to ""the most exacting scrutiny,""  id.  at   485 U. S. 321 , and, for the reasons stated in  Johnson, supra,  at   491 U. S. 413 -415, the Government's interest cannot justify its infringement on First Amendment rights.  This conclusion will not be reassessed in light of Congress' recent recognition of a purported ""national consensus"" favoring a prohibition on flag-burning, since any suggestion that the Government's interest in suppressing speech becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is foreign to the First Amendment.  While flag desecration -- like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures -- is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.

 LAKE COUNTY
 Syllabus   While petitioner Milkovich was a high school wrestling coach, his team was involved in an altercation at a match with another high school's team.  Both he and School Superintendent Scott testified at an investigatory hearing before the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which placed the team on probation.  They testified again during a suit by several parents, in which a county court overturned OHSAA's ruling.  The day after the court's decision, respondent Lorain Journal Company's newspaper published a column authored by respondent Diadiun, which implied that Milkovich lied under oath in the judicial proceeding.  Milkovich commenced a defamation action against respondents in the county court, alleging that the column accused him of committing the crime of perjury, damaged him in his occupation of teacher and coach, and constituted libel  per se.   Ultimately, the trial court granted summary judgment for respondents.  The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, considering itself bound by the State Supreme Court's determination in Superintendent Scott's separate action against respondents that, as a matter law, the article was constitutionally protected opinion. Held: 1. The First Amendment does not require a separate ""opinion"" privilege limiting the application of state defamation laws.  While the Amendment does limit such application,  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 , the breathing space that freedoms of expression require to survive is adequately secured by existing constitutional doctrine.    Foremost, where a media defendant is involved, a statement on matters of public concern must be provable as false before liability can be assessed,  Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps,   475 U. S. 767 , thus ensuring full constitutional protection for a statement of opinion having no provably false factual connotation.  Next, statements that cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual are protected,  see, e.g., Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Assn., Inc. v. Bresler,   398 U. S. 6 , thus assuring that public debate will not suffer for lack of ""imaginative expression"" or the ""rhetorical hyperbole"" which has traditionally added much to the discourse of this Nation.  The reference to ""opinion"" in dictum in  Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,   418 U. S. 323 ,   418 U. S. 339 -340, was not intended to create a wholesale defamation exemption for ""opinion.""  Read in context, the  Gertz  dictum is merely a reiteration of Justice Holmes' ""marketplace of ideas"" concept,  see Abrams v. United States,   250 U. S. 616 ,   250 U. S. 630 .  Simply couching a statement -- ""Jones is a liar"" -- in terms of opinion -- ""In my opinion, Jones is a liar"" -- does not dispel the factual implications contained in the statement.  Pp.   497 U. S. 11 -21. 2. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that the statements in the Diadiun column imply an assertion that Milkovich perjured himself in a judicial proceeding.  The article did not use the sort of loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language that would negate the impression that Diadiun was seriously maintaining Milkovich committed perjury.  Nor does the article's general tenor negate this impression.  In addition, the connotation that Milkovich committed perjury is sufficiently factual that it is susceptible of being proved true or false by comparing,  inter alia,  his testimony before the OHSAA board with his subsequent testimony before the trial court.  Pp.   497 U. S. 21 -22. 3. This decision balances the First Amendment's vital guarantee of free and uninhibited discussion of public issues with the important social values that underlie defamation law and society's pervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation.

 THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   The Illinois Governor issued an executive order instituting a hiring freeze, whereby state officials are prohibited from hiring any employee, filling any vacancy, creating any new position, or taking any similar action without the Governor's ""express permission.""  Petitioners and cross-respondents -- an applicant for employment, employees who had been denied promotions or transfers, and former employees who had not been recalled after layoffs -- brought suit in the District Court, alleging that, by means of the freeze, the Governor was operating a political patronage system; that they had suffered discrimination in state employment because they had not been Republican Party supporters; and that this discrimination violates the First Amendment.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  Noting that  Elrod v. Burns,   427 U. S. 347 , and  Branti v. Finkel,   445 U. S. 507 , had found that the patronage practice of discharging public employees on the basis of their political affiliation violates the First Amendment, the court held that other patronage practices violate the Amendment only when they are the ""substantial equivalent of a dismissal,""  i.e.,  when they would lead reasonable persons to resign.  The court concluded, based on  Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Education,   476 U. S. 267 , that rejecting an employment application did not impose a hardship comparable to the loss of a job.  Thus, it dismissed the hiring claim, but remanded the others for further proceedings. Held:   The rule of  Elrod  and  Branti  extends to promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring decisions based on party affiliation and support, and petitioners and cross-respondents have stated claims upon which relief may be granted.  Pp.   497 U. S. 68 -79. (a) Promotions, transfers, and recalls based on political affiliation or support are an impermissible infringement on public employees' First Amendment rights.  Even though petitioners and cross-respondents   have no legal entitlement to the promotions, transfers, and recalls, the government may not rely on a basis that infringes their constitutionally protected interests to deny them these valuable benefits.   Perry v. Sindermann,   408 U. S. 593 ,   408 U. S. 597 .  Significant penalties are imposed on those employees who exercise their First Amendment rights.  Those who do not compromise their beliefs stand to lose the considerable increases in pay and job satisfaction attendant to promotions, the shorter commuting hours and lower maintenance expenses incident to transfers to more convenient work locations, and even the jobs themselves in the case of recalls.  As in  Elrod  and  Branti,  these patronage practices are not narrowly tailored to serve vital government interests.  A government's interest in securing effective employees can be met by discharging, demoting, or transferring persons whose work is deficient, and its interest in securing employees who will loyally implement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or dismissing high-level employees on the basis of their political views.  Likewise, the ""preservation of the democratic process"" is not furthered by these patronage decisions, since political parties are nurtured by other less intrusive and equally effective methods, and since patronage decidedly impairs the elective process by discouraging public employees' free political expression.  Pp.   497 U. S. 71 -75. (b) The standard used by the Court of Appeals to measure alleged patronage practices in government employment is unduly restrictive because it fails to recognize that there are deprivations less harsh than dismissal that nevertheless press state employees and applicants to conform their beliefs and associations to some state-selected orthdoxy.  Pp.   497 U. S. 75 -76. (c) Patronage hiring places burdens on free speech and association similar to those imposed by patronage promotions, transfers, and recalls.  Denial of a state job is a serious privation, since such jobs provide financial, health, and other benefits; since there may be openings with the State when business in the private sector is slow; and since there are occupations for which the government is the sole or major employer.  Under this Court's sustained precedent, conditioning hiring decisions on political belief and association plainly constitutes an unconstitutional condition unless the government has a vital interest in doing so.   See, e.g., Branti, supra,  445 U.S. at   445 U. S. 515 -516.  There is no such government interest here, for the same reasons that the government lacks justification for patronage promotions, transfers, and recalls.  It is inappropriate to rely on  Wygant  to distinguish hiring from dismissal in this context, since that case was concerned with the least harsh means of remedying past wrongs, and did not question that some remedy was permissible when there was sufficient evidence of past discrimination.  Here, however, it is unnecessary to consider whether not being hired is less burdensome   than being discharged, because the government is not pressed to do either on the basis of political affiliation.

 Syllabus   Respondents, members of a political advocacy group, set up a table on a sidewalk near the entrance to a United States Post Office to solicit contributions, sell books and subscriptions to the organization's newspaper, and distribute literature on a variety of political issues.  The sidewalk is the sole means by which customers may travel from the parking lot to the post office building and lies entirely on Postal Service property.  When respondents refused to leave the premises, they were arrested and subsequently convicted by a Federal Magistrate of violating,  inter alia,  39 CFR § 232.1(h)(1), which prohibits solicitation on postal premises.  The District Court affirmed the convictions.  It rejected respondents' argument that § 232.1(h)(1) violated the First Amendment, holding that the postal sidewalk was not a public forum and that the ban on solicitation is reasonable.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Finding that the sidewalk is a public forum and analyzing the regulation as a time, place, and manner restriction, it determined that the Government has no significant interest in banning solicitation and that the regulation is not narrowly tailored to accomplish the asserted governmental interest. Held:   The judgment is reversed. 866 F.2d 699, (CA4 1989) reversed."

 Syllabus   Arkansas' Gross Receipts Act imposes a tax on receipts from the sale of all tangible personal property and specified services, but expressly exempts,  inter alia,  certain receipts from newspaper and magazine sales.  In 1987, Act 188 amended the Gross Receipts Act to impose the tax on cable television.  Petitioners in No. 90 38, a cable television subscriber, a cable operator, and a cable trade organization (cable petitioners), brought this class action in the State Chancery Court, contending that their expressive rights under the First Amendment and their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated by the extension of the tax to cable services, the exemption from the tax of newspapers and magazines, and the exclusion from the list of services subject to the tax of scrambled satellite broadcast television services to home dish antennae owners.  In 1989, shortly after the Chancery Court upheld the constitutionality of Act 188, Arkansas adopted Act 769, which extended the tax to, among other things, all television services to paying customers.  On appeal, the State Supreme Court held that the tax was not invalid after the passage of Act 769 because the Constitution does not prohibit the differential taxation of different media.  However, believing that the First Amendment does prohibit discriminatory taxation among members of the same medium, and that cable and scrambled satellite television services were ""substantially the same,"" the Supreme Court held that the tax was unconstitutional for the period during which it applied to cable but not satellite broadcast services. Held: 1. Arkansas' extension of its generally applicable sales tax to cable television services alone, or to cable and satellite services, while exempting the print media, does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.   499 U. S. 444 -453. (a) Although cable television, which provides news, information, and entertainment to its subscribers, is engaged in ""speech"" and is part of the ""press"" in much of its operation, the fact that it is taxed differently from other media does not, by itself, raise First Amendment concerns.    The Arkansas tax presents none of the First Amendment difficulties that have led this Court to strike down differential taxation of speakers.   See, e.g., Grosjean v. American Press Co.,   297 U. S. 233 ;  Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue,   460 U. S. 575 ;  Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland,   481 U. S. 221 .  It is a tax of general applicability covering all tangible personal property and a broad range of services and, thus, does not single out the press, and thereby threaten to hinder it as a watchdog of government activity.  Furthermore, there is no indication that Arkansas has targeted cable television in a purposeful attempt to interfere with its First Amendment activities, nor is the tax structured so as to raise suspicion that it was intended to do so.  Arkansas has not selected a small group of speakers to bear fully the burden of the tax, since, even if the State Supreme Court's finding that cable and satellite television are the same medium is accepted, Act 188 extended the tax uniformly to the approximately 100 cable systems then operating in the State.  Finally, the tax is not content-based, since there is nothing in the statute's language that refers to the content of mass media communications, and since the record contains no evidence that the variety of programming cable television offers subscribers differs systematically in its message from that communicated by satellite broadcast programming, newspapers, or magazines.  Pp.   499 U. S. 444 -449. (b) Thus, cable petitioners can prevail only if the Arkansas tax scheme presents ""an additional basis"" for concluding that the State has violated their First Amendment rights.   See Arkansas Writers' supra,  at   481 U.S. 233 .  This Court's decisions do not support their argument that such a basis exists here, because the tax discriminates among media and discriminated for a time within a medium.  Taken together, cases such as  Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington,   461 U. S. 540 ,  Mabee v. White Plains Publishing Co.,   327 U. S. 178 , and  Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling,   327 U. S. 186 , establish that differential taxation of speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas.  Nothing about Arkansas' choice to exclude or exempt certain media from its tax has ever suggested an interest in censoring the expressive activities of cable television.  Nor does anything in the record indicate that this broad-based, content-neutral tax is likely to stifle the free exchange of ideas.  Pp.   499 U. S. 449 -453. 2. The question whether Arkansas' temporary tax distinction between cable and satellite services violated the Equal Protection Clause must be addressed by the State Supreme Court on remand.  P.   499 U.

 FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Petitioner Masson, a psychoanalyst, became disillusioned with Freudian psychology while serving as Projects Director of the Sigmund Freud Archives, and was fired after advancing his own theories.  Thereafter, respondent Malcolm, an author and contributor to respondent The New Yorker, a magazine, taped several interviews with Masson and wrote a lengthy article on his relationship with the Archives.  One of Malcolm's narrative devices consists of enclosing lengthy passages attributed to Masson in quotation marks.  Masson allegedly expressed alarm about several errors in those passages before the article was published.  After its publication, and with knowledge of Masson's allegations that it contained defamatory material, respondent Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., published the work as a book, which portrayed Masson in a most unflattering light.  He brought an action for libel under California law in the Federal District Court, concentrating on passages alleged to be defamatory, six of which are before this Court.  In each instance, the quoted statement does not appear in the taped interviews.  The parties dispute whether there were additional untaped interviews, the notes from which Malcolm allegedly transcribed.  The court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment.  It concluded that the alleged inaccuracies were substantially true or were rational interpretations of ambiguous conversations, and therefore did not raise a jury question of actual malice, which is required when libel is alleged by a public figure.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.   The court found, among other things, that one passage -- in which Masson was quoted as saying that Archive officials had considered him an ""intellectual gigolo"" while the tape showed that he said he ""was much too junior within the hierarchy of analysis for these important . . . analysts to be caught dead with [him]"" -- was not defamatory, and would not be actionable under the ""incremental harm"" doctrine. Held: 1. The evidence presents a jury question whether Malcolm acted with requisite knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of five of the passages.  Pp.   501 U. S. 509 -525. (a) As relevant here, the First Amendment limits California's libel law by requiring that a public figure prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant published the defamatory statement with   actual malice.  However, in place of the term actual malice, it is better practice that jury instructions refer to publication of a statement with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to truth or falsity.  Pp.   501 U. S. 509 -511. (b) A trier of fact in this case could find that the reasonable reader would understand the quotations attributed to Masson to be nearly verbatim reports of his statements.  In general, quotation marks indicate a verbatim reproduction, and quotations add authority to a statement and credibility to an author's work.  A fabricated quotation may injure reputation by attributing an untrue factual assertion to the speaker, or by indicating a negative personal trait or an attitude the speaker does not hold.  While some quotations do not convey that the speaker actually said or wrote the quoted material, such is not the case here.  Malcolm's work gives the reader no clue that the quotations are anything but the reproductions of actual conversations, and the work was published in a magazine that enjoyed a reputation for scrupulous factual inquiry.  These factors could lead a reader to take the quotations at face value.  Pp.   501 U.S. 511 -513. (c) The common law of libel overlooks minor inaccuracies and concentrates upon substantial truth.  Thus, a deliberate alteration of a plaintiff's words does not equate with knowledge of falsity for purposes of  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,   376 U. S. 254 ,   376 U. S. 279 -280, and  Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,   418 U. S. 323 ,   418 U. S. 342 , unless it results in a material change in the statement's meaning.  While the use of quotations to attribute words not in fact spoken is important to that inquiry, the idea that any alteration beyond correction of grammar or syntax by itself proves falsity is rejected.  Even if a statement has been recorded, the existence of both a speaker and a reporter, the translation between two media, the addition of punctuation, and the practical necessity to edit and make intelligible a speakers' perhaps rambling comments, make it misleading to suggest that a quotation will be reconstructed with complete accuracy.  However, if alterations give a different meaning to a speaker's statements, bearing upon their defamatory character, then the device of quotations might well be critical in finding the words actionable.  Pp.   501 U. S. 513 -518. (d) Although the Court of Appeals applied a test of substantial truth, it erred in going one step further and concluding that an altered quotation is protected so long as it is a ""rational interpretation"" of the actual statement.  The protection for rational interpretation serves First Amendment principle by allowing an author the interpretive license that is necessary when relying upon ambiguous sources; but where a writer uses a quotation that a reasonable reader would conclude purports to be a verbatim repetition of the speaker's statement, the quotation   marks indicate that the author is not interpreting the speaker's ambiguous statement, but is attempting to convey what the speaker said.   Time, Inc. v. Pape,   401 U. S. 279 ;  Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,   466 U. S. 485 , distinguished.  Pp.   501 U. S. 518 -520. (e) In determining whether Masson has shown sufficient falsification to survive summary judgment, it must be assumed, except where otherwise evidenced by the tape recordings' transcripts, that he is correct in denying that he made the statements Malcolm attributed to him, and that Malcolm reported with knowledge or reckless disregard of the differences between what he said and what was quoted.  Malcolm's typewritten notes should not be considered, since Masson denied making the statements, and since the record contains substantial additional evidence to support a jury determination under a clear and convincing evidence standard that Malcolm deliberately or recklessly altered the quotations.  While she contests Masson's allegations, only a trial on the merits will resolve the factual dispute.  Pp.   501 U. S. 520 -521. (f) Five of the six published passages differ materially in meaning from the tape recorded statements so as to create an issue of fact for a jury as to falsity.  Whether the ""intellectual gigolo"" passage is defamatory is a question of California law, and to the extent that the Court of Appeals based its conclusion on the First Amendment, it was mistaken.  Moreover, an ""incremental harm"" doctrine -- which measures the incremental reputational harm inflicted by the challenged statements beyond the harm imposed by the nonactionable remainder of the publication -- is not compelled as a matter of First Amendment protection for speech, since it does not bear on whether a defendant has published a statement with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.  Pp.   501 U. S. 521 -525. 2. On remand, the Court of Appeals should consider Masson's argument that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the New Yorker Magazine, Inc., and Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., on the basis of their respective relations with Malcolm or the lack of any independent actual malice, since the court failed to reach his argument because of its disposition with respect to Malcolm.  P.   501 U. S. 525 . 895 F.2d 1535, (CA9 1989), reversed and remanded.

 FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
 Syllabus   Respondents, two Indiana establishments wishing to provide totally nude dancing as entertainment and individual dancers employed at those establishments, brought suit in the District Court to enjoin enforcement of the state public indecency law -- which requires respondent dancers to wear pasties and a G-string -- asserting that the law's prohibition against total nudity in public places violates the First Amendment.  The court held that the nude dancing involved here was not expressive conduct. The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that nonobscene nude dancing performed for entertainment is protected expression, and that the statute was an improper infringement of that activity because its purpose was to prevent the message of eroticism and sexuality conveyed by the dancers. Held:   The judgment is reversed. 904 F.2d 1081 (CA9 1990), reversed. The CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded that the enforcement of Indiana's public indecency law to prevent totally nude dancing does not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of expression.  Pp.   501 U. S. 565 -572. (a) Nude dancing of the kind sought to be performed here is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First Amendment, although only marginally so.   See, e.g., Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc.,   422 U. S. 922 ,   422 U. S. 932 .  Pp.   501 U. S. 565 -566. (b) Applying the four-part test of  United States v. O'Brien,   391 U. S. 367 ,   391 U. S. 376 -377 -- which rejected the contention that symbolic speech is entitled to full First Amendment protection -- the statute is justified despite its incidental limitations on some expressive activity.  The law is clearly within the State's constitutional power.  And it furthers a substantial governmental interest in protecting societal order and morality.  Public indecency statutes reflect moral disapproval of people appearing in the nude among strangers in public places, and this particular law follows a line of state laws, dating back to 1831, banning public nudity.  The States' traditional police power is defined as the authority to provide for the public health, safety, and morals, and such a basis for legislation   has been upheld.   See, e.g., Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,   413 U. S. 49 ,   413 U. S. 61 .  This governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, since public nudity is the evil the State seeks to prevent, whether or not it is combined with expressive activity.  The law does not proscribe nudity in these establishments because the dancers are conveying an erotic message.  To the contrary, an erotic performance may be presented without any state interference, so long as the performers wear a scant amount of clothing.  Finally, the incidental restriction on First Amendment freedom is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the governmental interest.  Since the statutory prohibition is not a means to some greater end, but an end itself, it is without cavil that the statute is narrowly tailored.  Pp.   501 U. S. 566 -572."

 Syllabus   During the 1982 Minnesota gubernatorial race, petitioner Cohen, who was associated with one party's campaign, gave court records concerning another party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor to respondent publishers' newspapers after receiving a promise of confidentiality from their reporters.  Nonetheless, the papers identified him in their stories, and he was fired from his job.  He filed suit against respondents in state court, alleging, among other things, a breach of contract.  The court rejected respondents' argument that the First Amendment barred the suit, and a jury awarded him,  inter alia,  compensatory damages.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, but the State Supreme Court reversed, holding that a contract cause of action was inappropriate.  It then went on to address the question whether Cohen could recover under state law on a promissory estoppel theory, even though that issue was never tried to a jury, nor briefed nor argued by the parties, concluding that enforcement under such a theory would violate respondents' First Amendment rights. Held: 1. This Court has jurisdiction.  Respondents' contention that the case should be dismissed because the promissory estoppel theory was not argued or presented in the courts below and because the State Supreme Court's decision rests entirely on a state law interpretation is rejected.  It is irrelevant to this Court's jurisdiction whether a party raised below and argued a federal law issue that the state supreme court actually considered and decided.   Orr v. Orr,   440 U. S. 268 ,   440 U. S. 274 -275.  Moreover, the Minnesota Supreme Court made clear that its holding rested on federal law, and respondents have defended against this suit all along by arguing that the First Amendment barred the enforcement of the reporters' promises.  Pp.   501 U. S. 667 -668. 2. The First Amendment does not bar a promissory estoppel cause of action against respondents.  Such a cause of action, although private, involves state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and therefore triggers the First Amendment's protections, since promissory estoppel is a state law doctrine creating legal obligations never explicitly assumed by the parties that are enforceable through the Minnesota courts' official power.   Cf., e.g.,   376 U. S.    v. Sullivan,     376 U. S. 254 ,   376 U. S. 265 .  However, the doctrine is a law of general applicability that does not target or single out the press, but rather is applicable to all Minnesota citizens' daily transactions.  Thus, the First Amendment does not require that its enforcement against the press be subject to stricter scrutiny than would be applied to enforcement against others,  cf. Associated Press v. NLRB,   301 U. S. 103 ,   301 U. S. 132 -133, even if the payment is characterized as compensatory damages.  Nor does that Amendment grant the press protection from any law which in any fashion or to any degree limits or restricts its right to report truthful information.   The Florida Star v. B.J.F.,   491 U. S. 524 , distinguished.  Moreover, Cohen sought damages for a breach of promise that caused him to lose his job and lowered his earning capacity, and did not attempt to use a promissory estoppel cause of action to avoid the strict requirements for establishing a libel or defamation claim.   Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell,   485 U. S. 46 , distinguished.  Any resulting inhibition on truthful reporting is no more than the incidental, and constitutionally insignificant, consequence of applying to the press a generally applicable law requiring them to keep certain promises.  Pp.   501 U. S. 668 -672. 3. Cohen's request that his compensatory damages award be reinstated is rejected.  The issues whether his verdict should be upheld on the ground that a promissory estoppel claim had been established under state law and whether the State Constitution may be construed to shield the press from an action such as this one are matters for the State Supreme Court to address and resolve in the first instance.

The Disciplinary Board found that Gentile violated the Rule and recommended that he be privately reprimanded.

After it discovered that petitioner publisher had signed an agreement with an author who had contracted with admitted organized crime figure Henry Hill for the production of a book about Hill's life, the Board,  inter alia,  determined that petitioner had violated the Son of Sam law and ordered it to turn over all money payable to Hill. Petitioner then brought suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, seeking a declaration that the law violates the First Amendment and an injunction barring the law's enforcement. The District Court found the law to be consistent with the Amendment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:  The Son of Sam law is inconsistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 115-123. (a) Whether the First Amendment ""speaker"" is considered to be Hill, whose income the New York law places in escrow because of the story he has told, or petitioner, which can publish books about crime with the assistance of only those criminals willing to forgo remuneration for at least five years, the law singles out speech on a particular subject for a financial burden that it places on no other speech and no other income and, thus, is presumptively inconsistent with the Amendment.  Leathers  v.  Medlock,  499 U. S. 439 , 447;  Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc.  v.  Ragland,  481 U. S. 221 , 230. The fact that the law escrows speechderived income, rather than taxing a percentage of it outright as did the law invalidated in  Arkansas Writers' Project,  cannot serve as the basis for disparate treatment under the Amendment, since both forms of financial burden operate as disincentives to speak. Moreover, the 106 
Syllabus Board's assertion that discriminatory financial treatment is suspect only when the legislature intends to suppress certain ideas is incorrect, since this Court has long recognized that even regulations aimed at proper governmental concerns can restrict unduly the exercise of rights under the Amendment. Furthermore, the Board's claim that the law is permissible under the Amendment because it focuses generally on an ""entity"" rather than specifically on the  media  falters, first, on semantic grounds, since any entity that enters into a contract with a convicted person to transmit that person's speech becomes by definition a medium of communication, and, second, on constitutional grounds, since the governmental power to impose content-based financial disincentives on speech does not vary with the identity of the speaker. Accordingly, in order to justify the differential treatment imposed by the law, the State must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.  Id.,  at 231. Pp. 115-118. (b) The State has a compelling interest in compensating victims from the fruits of crime. Cf.  Caplin  &  Drysdale, Chartered  v.  United States,  491 U. S. 617 , 629. However, contrary to the Board's assertion, the State has little if any interest in limiting such compensation to the proceeds of the wrongdoer's speech about the crime. The Board cannot explain why the State should have any greater interest in compensating victims from the proceeds of criminals' ""storytelling"" than from any of their other assets, nor offer any justification for a distinction between this expressive activity and any other activity in connection with its interest in transferring the fruits of crime from criminals to their victims. Cf.,  e. g., Arkansas Writers' Project, supra,  at 231. Like the governmental entities in the latter and similar cases, the Board has taken the  effect  of the statute and posited that effect as the State's interest. Pp. 118-121. (c) The New York law is not narrowly tailored to achieve the State's objective of compensating victims from the profits of crime. The law is significantly overinclusive, since it applies to works on  any  subject provided that they express the author's thoughts or recollections about his crime, however tangentially or incidentally, and since its broad definition of ""person convicted of a crime"" enables the Board to escrow the income of an author who admits in his work to having committed a crime, whether or not he was ever actually accused or convicted. These two provisions combine to encompass a wide range of existing and potential works that do not enable a criminal to profit from his crime while a victim remains uncompensated. Pp. 121-123. 916 F.2d 777 , reversed. 107 O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and WHITE, STEVENS, SCALIA, and SOUTER, JJ.,joined.

The court dismissed her suit, but the State Supreme Court reversed, ruling that the State had a compelling interest in banning such activities within the polling place itself but not on the premises around the polling place. Thus, it concluded, the 100-foot limit was not narrowly tailored to protect, and was not the least restrictive means to serve, the State's interests.

NATIONALIST MOVEMENT CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT 
No. 91-538. Argued March 31, 1992-Decided June 19, 1992 Petitioner county's Ordinance 34 mandates permits for private demonstrations and other uses of public property; declares that the cost of protecting participants in such activities exceeds the usual and normal cost of law enforcement and should be borne by the participants; requires every permit applicant to pay a fee of not more than $1,000; and empowers the county administrator to adjust the fee's amount to meet the expense incident to the ordinance's administration and to the maintenance of public order. After the county attempted to impose such a fee for respondent's proposed demonstration in opposition to the Martin Luther King, Jr., federal holiday, respondent filed this suit, claiming that the ordinance violates the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court denied relief, ruling that the ordinance was not unconstitutional as applied in this case. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that an ordinance which charges more than a nominal fee for using public forums for public issue speech is facially unconstitutional. Held:  The ordinance is facially invalid. Pp. 129-137. (a) In order to regulate competing uses of public forums, government may impose a permit requirement on those wishing to hold a march, parade, or rally, if,  inter alia,  the permit scheme does not delegate overly broad licensing discretion to a government official,  Freedman  v.  Maryland,  380 U. S. 51 , 56, and is not based on the content of the message, see  United States  v.  Grace,  461 U. S. 171 , 177. Pp. 129-130. (b) An examination of the county's implementation and authoritative constructions of the ordinance demonstrates the absence of the constitutionally required ""narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards,""  Niemotko  v.  Maryland,  340 U. S. 268 , 271, to guide the county administrator's hand when he sets a permit fee. The decision how much to charge for police protection or administrative time-or even whether to charge at all-is left to the unbridled discretion of the administrator, who is not required to rely on objective standards or provide any explanation for his decision. Pp. 130-133. (c) The ordinance is unconstitutionally content based because it requires that the administrator, in order to assess accurately the cost of 124 security for parade participants, must examine the content of the message conveyed, estimate the public response to that content, and judge the number of police necessary to meet that response.  Cox  v.  New Hampshire,  312 U. S. 569 , distinguished. Pp. 133-136. (d) Neither the $1,000 cap on the permit fee, nor even some lower ""nominal"" cap, could save the ordinance.  Murdock  v.  Pennsylvania,  319 U. S. 105 , 116, distinguished. The level of the fee is irrelevant in this context, because no limit on the fee's size can remedy the ordinance's constitutional infirmities. pp. 136-137. 913 F.2d 885  and  934 F.2d 1482 , affirmed.

CITY OF ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MINNESOTA No. 90-7675. Argued December 4, 1991-Decided June 22,1992 After allegedly burning a cross on a black family's lawn, petitioner R. A. V. was charged under,  inter alia,  the St. Paul, Minnesota, Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, which prohibits the display of a symbol which one knows or has reason to know ""arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender."" The trial court dismissed this charge on the ground that the ordinance was substantially overbroad and impermissibly content based, but the State Supreme Court reversed. It rejected the overbreadth claim because the phrase ""arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others"" had been construed in earlier state cases to limit the ordinance's reach to ""fighting words"" within the meaning of this Court's decision in  Chaplinsky  v.  New Hampshire,  315 U. S. 568 , 572, a category of expression unprotected by the First Amendment. The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly content based because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated threats to public safety and order. Held:  The ordinance is facially invalid under the First Amendment. Pp.381-396. (a) This Court is bound by the state court's construction of the ordinance as reaching only expressions constituting ""fighting words."" However, R. A. Vo's request that the scope of the  Chaplinsky  formulation be modified, thereby invalidating the ordinance as substantially overbroad, need not be reached, since the ordinance unconstitutionally prohibits speech on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses. P.381. (b) A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation, and fighting words, may be regulated  because of their constitutionally proscribable content.  However, these categories are not entirely invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate them based on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonpros crib able message they contain. Thus the regulation of ""fighting words"" may not be based on nonproscribable content. It may, however, be underinclusive, addressing some offensive instances and leaving other, equally offensive, ones alone, so long as the selective proscription is not based on content, or there is no realistic possibility that regulation of ideas is afoot. Pp. 382-390. 378 Syllabus (c) The ordinance, even as narrowly construed by the State Supreme Court, is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on the disfavored subjects of ""race, color, creed, religion or gender."" At the same time, it permits displays containing abusive invective if they are not addressed to those topics. Moreover, in its practical operation the ordinance goes beyond mere content, to actual viewpoint, discrimination. Displays containing ""fighting words"" that do not invoke the disfavored subjects would seemingly be useable  ad libitum  by those arguing in favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality, but not by their opponents. St. Paul's desire to communicate to minority groups that it does not condone the ""group hatred"" of bias-motivated speech does not justify selectively silencing speech on the basis of its content. Pp. 391-393. (d) The content-based discrimination reflected in the ordinance does not rest upon the very reasons why the particular class of speech at issue is pros crib able, it is not aimed only at the ""secondary effects"" of speech within the meaning of  Renton  v.  Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475  U. S. 41, and it is not for any other reason the sort that does not threaten censorship of ideas. In addition, the ordinance's content discrimination is not justified on the ground that the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in ensuring the basic human rights of groups historically discriminated against, since an ordinance not limited to the favored topics would have precisely the same beneficial effect.

WEISMAN, PERSONALLY AND AS NEXT FRIEND OF WEISMAN CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT No. 90-1014. Argued November 6, 1991-Decided June 24, 1992 Principals of public middle and high schools in Providence, Rhode Island, are permitted to invite members of the clergy to give invocations and benedictions at their schools' graduation ceremonies. Petitioner Lee, a middle school principal, invited a rabbi to offer such prayers at the graduation ceremony for Deborah Weisman's class, gave the rabbi a pamphlet containing guidelines for the composition of public prayers at civic ceremonies, and advised him that the prayers should be nonsectarian. Shortly before the ceremony, the District Court denied the motion of respondent Weisman, Deborah's father, for a temporary restraining order to prohibit school officials from including the prayers in the ceremony. Deborah and her family attended the ceremony, and the prayers were recited. Subsequently, Weisman sought a permanent injunction barring Lee and other petitioners, various Providence public school officials, from inviting clergy to deliver invocations and benedictions at future graduations. It appears likely that such prayers will be conducted at Deborah's high school graduation. The District Court enjoined petitioners from continuing the practice at issue on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:  Including clergy who offer prayers as part of an official public school graduation ceremony is forbidden by the Establishment Clause. Pp.586-599. (a) This Court need not revisit the questions of the definition and scope of the principles governing the extent of permitted accommodation by the State for its citizens' religious beliefs and practices, for the controlling precedents as they relate to prayer and religious exercise in primary and secondary public schools compel the holding here. Thus, the Court will not reconsider its decision in  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman, 403  U. S. 602. The principle that government may accommodate the free exercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause, which guarantees at a minimum that a government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which ""establishes a 578 Syllabus [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.""  Lynch  v.  Donnelly,  465 U. S. 668 , 678. Pp. 586-587. (b) State officials here direct the performance of a formal religious exercise at secondary schools' promotional and graduation ceremonies. Lee's decision that prayers should be given and his selection of the religious participant are choices attributable to the State. Moreover, through the pamphlet and his advice that the prayers be nonsectarian, he directed and controlled the prayers' content. That the directions may have been given in a good-faith attempt to make the prayers acceptable to most persons does not resolve the dilemma caused by the school's involvement, since the government may not establish an official or civic religion as a means of avoiding the establishment of a religion with more specific creeds. Pp. 587-590. (c) The Establishment Clause was inspired by the lesson that in the hands of government what might begin as a tolerant expression of religious views may end in a policy to indoctrinate and coerce. Prayer exercises in elementary and secondary schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion.  Engel  v.  Vitale,  370 U. S. 421 ;  School Dist. of Abington  v.  Schempp,  374 U. S. 203 . The school district's supervision and control of a high school graduation ceremony places subtle and indirect public and peer pressure on attending students to stand as a group or maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. A reasonable dissenter of high school age could believe that standing or remaining silent signified her own participation in, or approval of, the group exercise, rather than her respect for it. And the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a  de minimis  character, since that is an affront to the rabbi and those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors' rights. pp. 590-594. (d) Petitioners' argument that the option of not attending the ceremony excuses any inducement or coercion in the ceremony itself is rejected. In this society, high school graduation is one of life's most significant occasions, and a student is not free to absent herself from the exercise in any real sense of the term ""voluntary."" Also not dispositive is the contention that prayers are an essential part of these ceremonies because for many persons the occasion would lack meaning without the recognition that human achievements cannot be understood apart from their spiritual essence. This position fails to acknowledge that what 579 for many was a spiritual imperative was for the Weismans religious conformance compelled by the State. It also gives insufficient recognition to the real conflict of conscience faced by a student who would have to choose whether to miss graduation or conform to the state-sponsored practice, in an environment where the risk of compulsion is especially high. Pp. 594-596. (e) Inherent differences between the public school system and a session of a state legislature distinguish this case from  Marsh  v.  Chambers,  463 U. S. 783 , which condoned a prayer exercise. The atmosphere at a state legislature's opening, where adults are free to enter and leave with little comment and for any number of reasons, cannot compare with the constraining potential of the one school event most important for the student to attend. pp. 596-598. 908 F.2d 1090 , affirmed.

LEE, SUPERINTENDENT OF PORT AUTHORITY POLICE CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
No. 91-155. Argued March 25, 1992-Decided June 26,1992 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns and operates three major airports in the New York City area and controls certain terminal areas at the airports (hereinafter terminals), adopted a regulation forbidding,  inter alia,  the repetitive solicitation of money within the terminals. However, solicitation is permitted on the sidewalks outside the terminal buildings. Petitioner International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. (ISKCON), a not-for-profit religious corporation whose members, among other things, solicit funds in public places to support their movement, brought suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging that the regulation deprived its members of their First Amendment rights. The District Court granted ISKCON summary judgment, concluding that the terminals were public fora, and that the regulation banning solicitation failed because it was not narrowly tailored to support a compelling state interest. The Court of Appeals reversed as here relevant. It determined that the terminals are not public fora, and found that the ban on solicitation was reasonable. Held: 1. An airport terminal operated by a public authority is a nonpublic forum, and thus a ban on solicitation need only satisfy a reasonableness standard. Pp. 677-683. (a) The extent to which the Port Authority can restrict expressive activity on its property depends on the nature of the forum. Regulation of traditional public fora or designated public fora survives only if it is narrowly drawn to achieve a compelling state interest, but limitations on expressive activity conducted on any other government-owned property need only be reasonable to survive.  Perry Ed. Assn.  v.  Perry Local Educators' Assn.,  460 U. S. 37 , 45, 46. Pp. 677-679. (b) Neither by tradition nor purpose can the terminals be described as public fora. Airports have not historically been made available for speech activity. Given the lateness with which the modern air terminal has made its appearance, it hardly qualifies as a property that has ""immemorially ... time out of mind"" been held in the public trust and used 673 for the purposes of expressive activity. See  Hague  v.  Committee for Industrial Organization,  307 U. S. 496 , 515. Nor have airport operators opened terminals to such activities, see  Cornelius  v.  NAACP Legal Defense  &  Ed. Fund, Inc.,  473 U. S. 788 ,802, as evidenced by the operators' frequent and continuing litigation in this area. Pp. 679-681. (c) That speech activities may have historically occurred at ""transportation nodes"" such as rail and bus stations, wharves, and Ellis Island is not relevant. Many of these sites traditionally have had private ownership. In addition, equating airports with other transportation centers would not take into account differences among the various facilities that may affect the extent to which such facilities can accommodate expressive activity. It is unsurprising to find differences among the facilities. The Port Authority, other airport builders and managers, and the Federal Government all share the view that terminals are dedicated to the facilitation of efficient air travel, not the solicitation of contributions. Pp. 681-683. 2. The Port Authority's ban on solicitation is reasonable. Solicitation may have a disruptive effect on business by slowing the path of both those who must decide whether to contribute and those who must alter their paths to avoid the solicitation. In addition, a solicitor may cause duress by targeting the most vulnerable persons or commit fraud by concealing his affiliation or shortchanging purchasers. The fact that the targets are likely to be on a tight schedule, and thus are unlikely to stop and complain to authorities, compounds the problem. The Port Authority has determined that it can best achieve its legitimate interest in monitoring solicitation activity to assure that travelers are not interfered with unduly by limiting solicitation to the sidewalk areas outside the terminals. That area is frequented by an overwhelming percentage of airport users, making ISKCON's access to the general public quite complete. Moreover, it would be odd to conclude that the regulation is unreasonable when the Port Authority has otherwise assured access to a universally traveled area. While the inconvenience caused by ISKCON may seem small, the Port Authority could reasonably worry that the incremental effects of having one group and then another seek such access could prove quite disruptive.

DISCOVERY NETWORK, INC., ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT No. 91-1200. Argued November 9, 1992-Decided March 24, 1993 In 1989, petitioner city authorized respondent companies to place 62 freestanding newsracks on public property for the purpose of distributing free magazines that consisted primarily of advertisements for respondents' services. In 1990, motivated by its interest in the safety and attractive appearance of its streets and sidewalks, the city revoked respondents' permits on the ground that the magazines were ""commercial handbill[s],"" whose distribution on public property was prohibited by a pre-existing ordinance. In respondents' ensuing lawsuit, the District Court concluded that this categorical ban violated the First Amendment under the ""reasonable fit"" standard applied to the regulation of commercial speech in  Board of Trustees of State University of  N. Y. v.  Fox,  492 U. S. 469 . The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:  The city's selective and categorical ban on the distribution, via newsrack, of ""commercial handbills"" is not consistent with the dictates of the First Amendment. Pp. 416-431. (a) The record amply supports the conclusion that the city has not met its burden of establishing a ""reasonable fit"" between its legitimate interests in safety and esthetics and the means it chose to serve those interests. The ordinance's outdated prohibition of handbill distribution was enacted long before any concern about newsracks developed, for the apparent purpose of preventing the kind of visual blight caused by littering, rather than any harm associated with permanent, freestanding dispensing devices. The fact that the city failed to address its recently developed concern about newsracks by regulating their size, shape, appearance, or number indicates that it has not ""carefully calculated"" the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition. See  Fox,  492 U. S., at 480. The lower courts correctly ruled that the benefit to be derived from the removal of 62 newsracks out of a total of 1,500-2,000 on public property was small. Pp. 416-418. (b) The Court rejects the city's argument that, because every decrease in the overall number of newsracks on its sidewalks necessarily effects an increase in safety and an improvement in the attractiveness of the cityscape, there is a close fit between its ban on newsracks 411 dispensing ""commercial handbills"" and its interests in safety and esthetics. This argument is premised upon the distinction the city has drawn between commercial speech such as respondents', which is viewed as having only a low value, and the assertedly more valuable noncommercial speech of ""newspapers,"" whose distribution on public land is specifically authorized by separate provisions of the city code. The argument attaches more importance to that distinction than the Court's cases warrant and seriously underestimates the value of commercial speech. Moreover, because commercial and noncommercial publications are equally responsible for the safety concerns and visual blight that motivated the city, the distinction bears no relationship  whatsoever  to the admittedly legitimate interests asserted by the city and is an impermissible means of responding to those interests. Thus, on this record, the city has failed to make a showing that would justify its differential treatment of the two types of newsracks. pp. 418-428. (c) Because the city's regulation of newsracks is predicated on the difference in content between ordinary newspapers and commercial speech, it is not content neutral and cannot qualify as a valid time, place, or manner restriction on protected speech.

FANE CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT No. 91-1594. Argued December 7, 1992-Decided April 26, 1993 Respondent Fane, a certified public accountant (CPA) licensed to practice by the Florida Board of Accountancy, sued the Board for declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that its rule prohibiting CPA's from engaging in ""direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation"" to obtain new clients violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. He alleged that but for the prohibition he would seek clients through personal solicitation, as he had done while practicing in New Jersey, where such solicitation is permitted. The Federal District Court enjoined the rule's enforcement, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:  As applied to CPA solicitation in the business context, Florida's prohibition is inconsistent with the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp.765-777. (a) The type of personal solicitation prohibited here is clearly commercial expression to which First Amendment protections apply.  E.  g.,  Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy  v.  Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,  425 U. S. 748 , 762.  Ohralik  v.  Ohio State Bar Assn.,  436 U. S. 447 , which upheld a ban on in-person solicitation by lawyers, did not hold that all personal solicitation is without First Amendment protection. In denying CPA's and their clients the considerable advantages of solicitation in the commercial context, Florida's law threatens societal interests in broad access to complete and accurate commercial information that the First Amendment is designed to safeguard. However, commercial speech is ""linked inextricably"" with the commercial arrangement that it proposes, so that the State's interest in regulating the underlying transaction may give it a concomitant interest in the expression itself. Thus, Florida's rule need only be tailored in a reasonable manner to serve a substantial state interest in order to survive First Amendment scrutiny. See,  e. g., Central Hudson Gas  &  Electric Corp. (b) Even under the intermediate  Central Hudson  standard of review, Florida's ban cannot be sustained as applied to Fane's proposed speech. The Board's asserted interests-protecting consumers from fraud or overreaching by CPA's and maintaining CPA independence and ensur- 762 Syllabus ing against conflicts of interest-are substantial. However, the Board has failed to demonstrate that the ban advances those interests in any direct and material way. A governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree. Here, the Board's suppositions about the dangers of personal solicitation by CPA's in the business context are not validated by studies, anecdotal evidence, or Fane's own conduct; and its claims are contradicted by a report of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and other literature. Nor can the ban be justified as a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction on speech. Even assuming that a flat ban on commercial solicitation could be regarded as such a restriction, the ban still must serve a substantial state interest in a direct and material way. Pp. 767-773. (c) The ban cannot be justified as a prophylactic rule because the circumstances of CPA solicitation in the business context are not ""inherently conducive to overreaching and other forms of misconduct.""  Ohralik, supra,  at 464. Unlike a lawyer, who is trained in the art of persuasion, a CPA is trained in a way that emphasizes independence and objectivity rather than advocacy. Moreover, while a lawyer may be soliciting an unsophisticated, injured, or distressed lay person, a CPA's typical prospective client is a sophisticated and experienced business executive who has an existing professional relation with a CPA, who selects the time and place for their meeting, and for whom there is no expectation or pressure to retain the CPA on the spot. In addition,  Ohralik  in no way relieves a State of the obligation to demonstrate that its restrictions on speech address a serious problem and contribute in a material way to solving that problem.

Argued February 24, 1993-Decided June 7, 1993 New York law authorizes local school boards to adopt reasonable regulations permitting the after-hours use of school property for 10 specified purposes, not including meetings for religious purposes. Pursuant to this law, respondent school board (District) issued rules and regulations allowing,  inter alia,  social, civic, and recreational uses of its schools (Rule 10), but prohibiting use by any group for religious purposes (Rule 7). After the District refused two requests by petitioners, an evangelical church and its pastor (Church), to use school facilities for a religious oriented film series on family values and child rearing on the ground that the film series appeared to be church related, the Church filed suit in the District Court, claiming that the District's actions violated, among other things, the First Amendment's Freedom of Speech Clause. The court granted summary judgment to the District, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. It reasoned that the school property, as a ""limited public forum"" open only for designated purposes, remained nonpublic except for the specified purposes, and ruled that the exclusion of the Church's film was reasonable and viewpoint neutral. Held:  Denying the Church access to school premises to exhibit the film series violates the Freedom of Speech Clause. Pp. 390-397. (a) There is no question that the District may legally preserve the property under its control and need not have permitted after-hours use for any of the uses permitted under state law. This Court need not address the issue whether Rule 10, by opening the property to a wide variety of communicative purposes, has opened the property for religious uses, because, even if the District has not opened its property for such uses, Rule 7 has been unconstitutionally applied in this case. Access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter or speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable and viewpoint neutral.  Cornelius  v.  NAACP Legal Defense and Ed. Fund, Inc., 473  U. S. 788, 806. That Rule 7 treats all religions and religious purposes alike does not make its application in this case viewpoint neutral, however, for it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint by permitting school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child rearing except those dealing with the subject from a religious 385 standpoint. Denial on this basis is plainly invalid under the holding in  Cornelius, supra,  at 806, that the government violates the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject. Pp. 390-394. (b) Permitting District property to be used to exhibit the film series would not have been an establishment of religion under the three-part test articulated in  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403 U. S. 602 . Since the series would not have been shown during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, there would be no realistic danger that the community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed, and any benefit to religion or the Church would have been incidental.  Widmar  v.  Vincent,  454 U. S. 263 , 271-272. Nor is there anything in the record to support the claim that the exclusion was justified on the ground that allowing access to a ""radical"" church would lead to threats of public unrest and violence. In addition, the Court of Appeals' judgment was not based on the justification proffered here that the access rules' purpose is to promote the interests of the general public rather than sectarian or other private interests. Moreover, that there was no express finding below that the Church's application would have been granted absent the religious connection is beside the point for the purposes of this opinion, which is concerned with the validity of the stated reason for denying the application, namely, that the film series appeared to be church related.

MITCHELL CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF WISCONSIN No. 92-515. Argued April 21, 1993-Decided June 11, 1993 Pursuant to a Wisconsin statute, respondent Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected his victim on account of the victim's race. The State Court of Appeals rejected his challenge to the law's constitutionality, but the State Supreme Court reversed. Relying on  R. A. V.  v.  St. Paul,  505 U. S. 377 , it held that the statute violates the First Amendment by punishing what the legislature has deemed to be offensive thought and rejected the State's contention that the law punishes only the conduct of intentional victim selection. It also found that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because the evidentiary use of a defendant's prior speech would have a chilling effect on those who fear they may be prosecuted for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. Finally, it distinguished antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional, on the ground that they prohibit objective acts of discrimination, whereas the state statute punishes the subjective mental process. Held:  Mitchell's First Amendment rights were not violated by the application of the penalty-enhancement provision in sentencing him. Pp. 483-490. (a) While Mitchell correctly notes that this Court is bound by a state court's interpretation of a state statute, the State Supreme Court did not construe the instant statute in the sense of defining the meaning of a particular word or phrase. Rather, it characterized the statute's practical effect for First Amendment purposes. Thus, after resolving any ambiguities in the statute's meaning, this Court may form its own judgment about the law's operative effect. The State's argument that the statute punishes only conduct does not dispose of Mitchell's claim, since the fact remains that the same criminal conduct is more heavily punished if the victim is selected because of his protected status than if no such motive obtains. Pp. 483-485. (b) In determining what sentence to impose, sentencing judges have traditionally considered a wide variety of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt, including a defendant's motive for committing the offense. While it is equally true that a sentencing judge may not take into consideration a defendant's abstract beliefs, however obnoxious to most people, the Constitution does not erect a  per se  barrier to the 477 admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because they are protected by the First Amendment.  Dawson  v.  Delaware,  503 U. S. 159 ;  Barclay  v.  Florida,  463 U. S. 939  (plurality opinion). That  Dawson  and  Barclay  did not involve the application of a penalty-enhancement provision does not make them inapposite.  Barclay  involved the consideration of racial animus in determining whether to sentence a defendant to death, the most severe ""enhancement"" of all; and the state legislature has the primary responsibility for fixing criminal penalties. Motive plays the same role under the state statute as it does under federal and state antidiscrimination laws, which have been upheld against constitutional challenge. Nothing in  R. A. V.  v.  St. Paul, supra,  compels a different result here. The ordinance at issue there was explicitly directed at speech, while the one here is aimed at conduct unprotected by the First Amendment. Moreover, the State's desire to redress what it sees as the greater individual and societal harm inflicted by bias-inspired conduct provides an adequate explanation for the provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases. Pp. 485-488. (c) Because the statute has no ""chilling effect"" on free speech, it is not unconstitutionally overbroad. The prospect of a citizen suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of those beliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he commits a serious offense against person or property is too speculative a hypothesis to support this claim. Moreover, the First Amendment permits the admission of previous declarations or statements to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent, subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and the like.

Argued November 4, 1992-Decided June 11, 1993 Petitioner church and its congregants practice the Santeria religion, which employs animal sacrifice as one of its principal forms of devotion. The animals are killed by cutting their carotid arteries and are cooked and eaten following all Santeria rituals except healing and death rites. After the church leased land in respondent city and announced plans to establish a house of worship and other facilities there, the city council held an emergency public session and passed, among other enactments, Resolution 87-66, which noted city residents' ""concern"" over religious practices inconsistent with public morals, peace, or safety, and declared the city's ""commitment"" to prohibiting such practices; Ordinance 87-40, which incorporates the Florida animal cruelty laws and broadly punishes ""[w]hoever ... unnecessarily or cruelly ... kills any animal,"" and has been interpreted to reach killings for religious reasons; Ordinance 87-52, which defines ""sacrifice"" as ""to unnecessarily kill ... an animal in a ... ritual ... not for the primary purpose of food consumption,"" and prohibits the ""possess[ion], sacrifice, or slaughter"" of an animal if it is killed in ""any type of ritual"" and there is an intent to use it for food, but exempts ""any licensed [food] establishment"" if the killing is otherwise permitted by law; Ordinance 87-71, which prohibits the sacrifice of animals, and defines ""sacrifice"" in the same manner as Ordinance 87-52; and Ordinance 87-72, which defines ""slaughter"" as ""the killing of animals for food"" and prohibits slaughter outside of areas zoned for slaughterhouses, but includes an exemption for ""small numbers of hogs and/or cattle"" when exempted by state law. Petitioners filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging violations of their rights under,  inter alia,  the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Although acknowledging that the foregoing ordinances are not religiously neutral, the District Court ruled for the city, concluding, among other things, that compelling governmental interests in preventing public health risks and cruelty to animals fully justified the absolute prohibition on ritual sacrifice accomplished by the ordinances, and that an exception to that prohibition for religious conduct would unduly interfere with fulfillment of the governmental interest because any more narrow restrictions would 521 be unenforceable as a result of the Santeria religion's secret nature. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:  The judgment is reversed.  936 F.2d 586 , reversed."

ZOBREST ET AL.  v.  CATALINA FOOTHILLS SCHOOL DISTRICT CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT 
No. 92-94. Argued February 24, 1993-Decided June 18, 1993 Petitioners, a deaf child and his parents, filed this suit after respondent school district refused to provide a sign-language interpreter to accompany the child to classes at a Roman Catholic high school. They alleged that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment required respondent to provide the interpreter and that the Establishment Clause did not bar such relief. The District Court granted respondent summary judgment on the ground that the interpreter would act as a conduit for the child's religious inculcation, thereby promoting his religious development at government expense in violation of the Establishment Clause. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: 1. The prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions if there is a nonconstitutional ground for decision is inapplicable here, since respondent did not urge upon the District Court or the Court of Appeals any of the nonconstitutional grounds it now raises in this Court. Pp.6-8. 2. The Establishment Clause does not prevent respondent from furnishing a disabled child enrolled in a sectarian school with a signlanguage interpreter in order to facilitate his education. Government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge just because sectarian institutions may also 2 receive an attenuated financial benefit.  Mueller  v.  Allen,  463 U. S. 388 ;  Witters  v.  Washington Dept. of Services for Blind,  474 U. S. 481 . The same reasoning used in  Mueller  and  Witters  applies here. The service in this case is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as disabled under the IDEA, without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the school the child attends. By according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of individual parents' private decisions. Since the IDEA creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school, an interpreter's presence there cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking. The fact that a public employee will be physically present in a sectarian school does not by itself make this the same type of aid that was disapproved in  Meek  v.  Pittenger,  421 U. S. 349 , and  School Dist. of Grand Rapids  v.  Ball,  473 U. S. 373 . In those cases, the challenged programs gave direct grants of government aid-instructional equipment and material, teachers, and guidance counselors-which relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students. Here, the child is the primary beneficiary, and the school receives only an incidental benefit. In addition, an interpreter, unlike a teacher or guidance counselor, neither adds to nor subtracts from the sectarian school's environment but merely interprets whatever material is presented to the class as a whole. There is no absolute bar to the placing of a public employee in a sectarian school. Pp.8-14. 963 F.2d 1190 , reversed. REHNQUIST, C.

No. 92-486. Argued April 21, 1993-Decided June 25,1993 Congress has enacted federal lottery legislation to assist States in their efforts to control this form of gambling. Among other things, the scheme generally prohibits the broadcast of any lottery advertisements, 18 U. S. C. § 1304, but allows broadcasters to advertise state-run lotteries on stations licensed to a State which conducts such lotteries, § 1307. This exemption was enacted to accommodate the operation of legally authorized state-run lotteries consistent with continued federal protection to nonlottery States' policies. North Carolina is a nonlottery State, while Virginia sponsors a lottery. Respondent broadcaster (Edge) owns and operates a radio station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to serve a North Carolina community, and it broadcasts from near the Virginia-North Carolina border. Over 90% of its listeners are in Virginia, but the remaining listeners live in nine North Carolina counties. Wishing to broadcast Virginia lottery advertisements, Edge filed this action, alleging that, as applied to it, the restriction violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. The District Court assessed the restriction under the four-factor test for commercial speech set forth in  Central Hudson Gas  &  Elec. Corp.  v.  Public Servo Comm'n of N.  Y.,  447 U. S. 557 , 566-(1) whether the speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial; and if so, (3) whether the regulation directly advances the asserted interest and (4) whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve the interest-concluding that the statutes, as applied to Edge, did not directly advance the asserted governmental interest. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:  The judgment is reversed.  956 F.2d 263 , reversed."

UNITED STATES CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT 
No. 91-1526. Argued January 12, 1993-Decided June 28,1993 After a full criminal trial, petitioner, the owner of numerous businesses dealing in sexually explicit materials, was convicted of,  inter alia,  violating federal obscenity laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The obscenity convictions, based on a finding that seven items sold at several stores were obscene, were the predicates for his RICO convictions. In addition to imposing a prison term and fine, the District Court ordered petitioner, as punishment for the RICO violations, to forfeit his businesses and almost $9 million acquired through racketeering activity. In affirming the forfeiture order, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's arguments that RICO's forfeiture provisions constitute a prior restraint on speech and are overbroad. The court also held that the forfeiture did not violate the Eighth Amendment, concluding that proportionality review is not required of any sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. It did not consider whether the forfeiture was disproportionate or ""excessive."" Held: 1. RICO's forfeiture provisions, as applied here, did not violate the First Amendment. Pp. 549-558. (a) The forfeiture here is a permissible criminal punishment, not a prior restraint on speech. The distinction between prior restraints and subsequent punishments is solidly grounded in this Court's cases. The term ""prior restraint"" describes orders  forbidding  certain communications that are issued before the communications occur. See,  e. g., Near  v.  Minnesota ex rel. Olson,  283 U. S. 697 . However, the order here imposes no legal impediment to petitioner's ability to engage in any expressive activity; it just prevents him from financing those activities with assets derived from his prior racketeering offenses. RICO is oblivious to the expressive or nonexpressive nature of the assets forfeited. Petitioner's assets were forfeited because they were directly related to past racketeering violations, and thus they differ from material seized or restrained on suspicion of being obscene without a prior judicial obscenity determination, as occurred in,  e. g., Marcus  v.  Search Warrant of Kansas City, Mo., Property,  367 U. S. 717 . Nor were his assets ordered forfeited without the requisite procedural safeguards. 545 Fort Wayne Books, Inc.  v.  Indiana,  489 U. S. 46 , distinguished. His claim is also inconsistent with  Arcara  v.  Cloud Books, Inc.,  478 U. S. 697 , in which the Court rejected a claim that the closure of an adult bookstore under a general nuisance statute was an improper prior restraint. His definition of prior restraint also would undermine the time-honored distinction between barring future speech and penalizing past speech. Pp. 549-554. (b) Since the RICO statute does not criminalize constitutionally protected speech, it is materially different from the statutes at issue in this Court's overbreadth cases. Cf.,  e. g., Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles  v.  Jewsfor Jesus, Inc.,  482 U. S. 569 , 574-575. In addition, the threat of forfeiture has no more of a ""chilling"" effect on free expression than threats of a prison term or large fine, which are constitutional under  Fort Wayne Books.  Nor can the forfeiture be said to offend the First Amendment based on  Arcara's  analysis that criminal sanctions with some incidental effect on First Amendment activities are subject to First Amendment scrutiny where it was the expressive conduct that drew the legal remedy, 478 U. S., at 706-707. While the conduct drawing the legal remedy here may have been expressive, ""obscenity"" can be regulated or actually proscribed consistent with the Amendment, see,  e. g., Roth  v.  United States,  354 U. S. 476 , 485. Pp. 554-558. 2. The case is remanded for the Court of Appeals to consider petitioner's claim that the forfeiture, considered atop his prison term and fine, is ""excessive"" within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's Eighth Amendment challenge with a statement that applies only to the Amendment's prohibition against ""cruel and unusual punishments."" The Excessive Fines Clause limits the Government's power to extract payments as punishment for an offense, and the  in personam  criminal forfeiture at issue here is clearly a form of monetary punishment no different, for Eighth Amendment purposes, from a traditional ""fine."" The question whether the forfeiture was excessive must be considered in light of the extensive criminal activities that petitioner apparently conducted through his enormous racketeering enterprise over a substantial period of time rather than the number of materials actually found to be obscene. Pp. 558-559. 943 F.2d 825 , vacated and remanded. REHNQUIST, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which WHITE, O'CONNOR, SCALIA, and THOMAS, JJ., joined.

Argued December 1, 1993-Decided May 31, 1994 Petitioners fired respondent Churchill from her nursing job at a public hospital, allegedly because of statements she made to co-worker Perkins-Graham during a work break. What Churchill actually said during the conversation is in dispute. Petitioners' version was based on interviews with Perkins-Graham and one Ballew, who had overheard part of the conversation, and indicated that Churchill made disruptive statements critical of her department and of petitioners. However, in Churchill's version, which was corroborated by others who had overheard part of the conversation, her speech was largely limited to nondisruptive statements critical of the hospital's ""cross-training"" policy, which she believed threatened patient care. Churchill sued under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, claiming that her speech was protected under Connick v. Myers,  461 U. S. 138 , 142, in which the Court held that the First Amendment protects a government employee's speech if it is on a matter of public concern and the employee's interest in expressing herself on this matter is not outweighed by any injury the speech could cause to the government's interest, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees. The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, holding that management could fire Churchill with impunity because neither version of the conversation was protected under Connick. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that Churchill's speech, viewed in the light most favorable to her, was on a matter of public concern and was not disruptive, and that the inquiry must turn on what her speech actually was, as determined by a jury, not on what the employer thought it was. Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.  977 F.2d 1114 , vacated and remanded."

GILLEO CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT No. 92-1856. Argued February 23, 1994-Decided June 13, 1994 An ordinance of petitioner City of Ladue bans all residential signs but those falling within 1 of 10 exemptions, for the principal purpose of minimizing the visual clutter associated with such signs. Respondent Gilleo filed this action, alleging that the ordinance violated her right to free speech by prohibiting her from displaying a sign stating, ""For Peace in the Gulf,"" from her home. The District Court found the ordinance unconstitutional, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the ordinance was a ""content based"" regulation, and that Ladue's substantial interests in enacting it were not sufficiently compelling to support such a restriction. Held:  The ordinance violates a Ladue resident's right to free speech. Pp.48-59. (a) While signs pose distinctive problems and thus are subject to municipalities' police powers, measures regulating them inevitably affect communication itself. Such a regulation may be challenged on the ground that it restricts too little speech because its exemptions discriminate on the basis of signs' messages, or on the ground that it prohibits too much protected speech. For purposes of this case, the validity of Ladue's submission that its ordinance's various exemptions are free of impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination is assumed. Pp.48-53. (b) Although Ladue has a concededly valid interest in minimizing visual clutter, it has almost completely foreclosed an important and distinct medium of expression to political, religious, or personal messages. Prohibitions foreclosing entire media may be completely free of content or viewpoint discrimination, but such measures can suppress too much speech by eliminating a common means of speaking. Pp. 54-55. (c) Ladue's attempt to justify the ordinance as a ""time, place, or manner"" restriction fails because alternatives such as handbills and newspaper advertisements are inadequate substitutes for the important medium that Ladue has closed off. Displaying a sign from one's own residence carries a message quite distinct from placing the same sign someplace else, or conveying the same text or picture by other means, for it provides information about the speaker's identity, an important component of many attempts to persuade. Residential signs are also 44 Syllabus an unusually cheap and convenient form of communication. Furthermore, the audience intended to be reached by a residential sign-neighbors-could not be reached nearly as well by other means. Pp. 56-57. (d) A special respect for individual liberty in the home has long been part of this Nation's culture and law and has a special resonance when the government seeks to constrain a person's ability to speak there. The decision reached here does not leave Ladue powerless to address the ills that may be associated with residential signs. In addition, residents' self-interest in maintaining their own property values and preventing ""visual clutter"" in their yards and neighborhoods diminishes the danger of an ""unlimited"" proliferation of signs.

No. 93-44. Argued January 12, 1994-Decided June 27,1994 Concerned that a competitive imbalance between cable television and over-the-air broadcasters was endangering the broadcasters' ability to compete for a viewing audience and thus for necessary operating revenues, Congress passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act require cable television systems to devote a specified portion of their channels to the transmission of local commercial and public broadcast stations. Soon after the Act became law, appellants, numerous cable programmers and operators, challenged the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions. The District Court granted the United States and intervenordefendants summary judgment, ruling that the provisions are consistent with the First Amendment. The court rejected appellants' argument that the provisions warrant strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation and sustained them under the intermediate standard of scrutiny set forth in  United States  v.  O'Brien,  391 U. S. 367 , concluding that they are sufficiently tailored to serve the important governmental interest in the preservation of local broadcasting. Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. 819 F. Supp. 32, vacated and remanded."

Argued March 30, 1994-Decided June 27,1994* The New York village of Kiryas Joel is a religious enclave of Satmar Hasidim, practitioners of a strict form of Judaism. Its incorporators intentionally drew its boundaries under the State's general village incorporation law to exclude all but Satmars. The village fell within the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District until a special state statute, 1989 N. Y. Laws, ch. 748, carved out a separate district that follows village lines. Although the statute gives a locally elected school board plenary authority over primary and secondary education in the village, the board currently runs only a special education program for handicapped children; other village children attend private religious schools, which do not offer special educational services. Shortly before the new district began operations, respondents and others brought this action claiming,  inter alia,  that Chapter 748 violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The state trial court granted summary judgment for respondents, and both the intermediate appellate court and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that Chapter 748's primary effect was impermissibly to advance religion. Held:  The judgment is affirmed. 81 N. Y. 2d 518, 618 N. E. 2d 94, affirmed."

X-CITEMENT VIDEO, INC., ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT No. 93-723. Argued October 5, 1994-Decided November 29,1994 Respondents were convicted under the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977, which prohibits ""knowingly"" transporting, shipping, receiving, distributing, or reproducing a visual depiction, 18 U. S. C. §§ 2252(a)(I) and (2), if such depiction ""involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,"" §§ 2252(a)(I)(A) and (2)(A). In reversing, the Ninth Circuit held,  inter alia,  that § 2252 was facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment because it did not require a showing that the defendant knew that one of the performers was a minor. Held:  Because the term ""knowingly"" in §§ 2252(1) and (2) modifies the phrase ""the use of a minor"" in subsections (1)(A) and (2)(A), the Act is properly read to include a scienter requirement for age of minority. This Court rejects the most natural grammatical reading, adopted by the Ninth Circuit, under which ""knowingly"" modifies only the relevant verbs in subsections (1) and (2), and does not extend to the elements of the minority of the performers, or the sexually explicit nature of the material, because they are set forth in independent clauses separated by interruptive punctuation. Some applications of that reading would sweep within the statute's ambit actors who had no idea that they were even dealing with sexually explicit material, an anomalous result that the Court will not assume Congress to have intended. Moreover,  Morissette  v.  United States,  342 U. S. 246 ,271, reinforced by  Staples  v.  United States,  511 U. S. 600 , 619, instructs that the standard presumption in favor of a scienter requirement should apply to each of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct, and the minority status of the performers is the crucial element separating legal innocence from wrongful conduct under § 2252. The legislative history, although unclear as to whether Congress intended ""knowingly"" to extend to performer age, persuasively indicates that the word applies to the sexually explicit conduct depicted, and thereby demonstrates that ""knowingly"" is emancipated from merely modifying the verbs in subsections (1) and (2). As a matter of grammar, it is difficult to conclude that the word modifies one of the elements in subsections (1)(A) and (2)(A), but not the other. This interpretation is supported by the canon that a 65 statute is to be construed where fairly possible so as to avoid substantial constitutional questions. pp. 67-79. 982 F.2d 1285 , reversed.

NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT No. 93-1525. Argued November 7, 1994-Decided February 21, 1995 Petitioner Lebron, who creates billboard displays that comment on public issues, filed suit claiming,  inter alia,  that respondent National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) had violated his First Amendment rights by rejecting a display for an Amtrak billboard because of its political nature. The District Court ruled that Amtrak, because of its close ties to the Federal Government, was a Government actor for First Amendment purposes, and that its rejection of the display was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals reversed, noting that Amtrak was, by the terms of the legislation that created it, not a Government entity, and concluding that the Government was not so involved with Amtrak that the latter's decisions could be considered federal action. Held:  Where, as here, the Government creates a corporation by special law, for the furtherance of governmental objectives, and retains for itself permanent authority to appoint a majority of that corporation's directors, the corporation is part of the Government for purposes of the First Amendment. Pp. 378-400. (a) It is proper for this Court to consider the argument that Amtrak is part of the Government, even though Lebron disavowed it in both lower courts and did not explicitly raise it until his brief on the merits here. It is not a new claim, but a new argument to support his First Amendment claim, see,  e.  g.,  Yee  v.  Escondido,  503 U. S. 519 , 534-535; it was passed upon below, see,  e.  g.,  United States  v.  Williams,  504 U. S. 36 , 41; and it was fairly embraced within both the question presented and the argument set forth in the petition. Pp. 378-383. (b) Amtrak was created by the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (RPSA) to avert the threatened extinction of passenger trains in the interest of ""the public convenience and necessity."" The legislation establishes detailed goals for Amtrak, sets forth its structure and powers, and assigns the appointment of a majority of its board of directors to the President. Pp. 383-386. (c) There is a long history of corporations created and participated in by the United States for the achievement of governmental objectives. Like some other Government corporations, Amtrak's authorizing stat- 375 ute provides that it ""will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government,"" 84 Stat. 1330; see also 45 U. S. C. § 541. Pp.386-391. (d) Although § 541 is assuredly dispositive of Amtrak's governmental status for purposes of matters within Congress's control--e.  g.,  whether it is subject to statutes like the Administrative Procedure Act-and can even suffice to deprive it of all those inherent governmental powers and immunities that Congress has the power to eliminate-e.  g.,  sovereign immunity from suit-it is not for Congress to make the final determination of Amtrak's status as a Government entity for purposes of determining the constitutional rights of citizens affected by its actions. The Constitution constrains governmental action by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken,  Ex parte Virginia,  100 U. S. 339 ,346-347, and under whatever congressional label,  Cherry Cotton Mills, Inc.  v.  United States,  327 U. S. 536 , 539.  National Railroad Passenger Corporation  v.  Boston  &  Maine Corp.,  503 U. S. 407 , 410, and  National Railroad Passenger Corporation  v.  Atchison, T.  & S. (e) Amtrak is an agency or instrumentality of the United States for the purpose of individual rights guaranteed against the Government by the Constitution. This conclusion accords with the public, judicial, and congressional understanding over the years that Government-created and -controlled corporations are part of the Government itself. See,  e. g., Reconstruction Finance Corporation  v.  J.  G.  Menihan Corp., 312  U. S. 81, 83; Government Corporation Control Act, § 304(a), 59 Stat. 602. A contrary holding would allow government to evade its most solemn constitutional obligations by simply resorting to the corporate form, cf.  Pennsylvania  v.

NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT No. 93-1170. Argued November 8, 1994-Decided February 22,1995 After § 501(b) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was amended to prohibit a Member of Congress, federal officer, or other Government employee from accepting an honorarium for making an appearance or speech or writing an article, respondents-including individual members of, and a union representing, a class composed of all Executive Branch employees below grade GS-16 who, but for § 501(b), would receive honoraria-filed a suit challenging the statute as an unconstitutional abridgment of their freedom of speech. The speeches and articles for which respondents had received honoraria in the past concerned matters such as religion, history, dance, and the environment; with few exceptions, neither their subjects nor the persons or groups paying for them had any connection with respondents' official duties. In granting respondents' motion for summary judgment, the District Court held § 501(b) unconstitutional insofar as it applies to Executive Branch employees and enjoined the Government from enforcing it against any such employee. The Court of Appeals affirmed, emphasizing,  inter alia,  that the Government's failure as to many respondents to identify some sort of nexus between the employee's job and either the expression's subject matter or the payor's character undercut its proffered concern about actual or apparent improprieties in the receipt of honoraria. Held:  Section 501(b) violates the First Amendment. Pp. 464-480. (a) The honoraria ban imposes the kind of burden that abridges speech under the First Amendment. Where, as here, Government employees seek to exercise their right as citizens to comment on matters of public interest, and are not attempting simply to speak as employees upon personal matters, the Government must be able to satisfy a balancing test of the type set forth in  Pickering  v.  Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,  391 U. S. 563 , 568, in order to maintain a statutory restriction on the employees' speech. See  Civil Service Comm'n  v.  Letter Carriers,  413 U. S. 548 , 564. However, because § 501(b) constitutes a wholesale deterrent to a broad category of expression by a massive number of potential speakers, the Government's burden here is even greater than it was in  Pickering  and its progeny, which 455 usually involved individual disciplinary actions taken in response to particular government employees' actual speech. Specifically, the Government must show that the interests of both potential audiences and a vast group of present and future employees in a broad range of present and future expression are outweighed by that expression's ""necessary impact on the actual operation"" of the Government,  Pickering,  391 U. S., at 571. Although § 501(b) neither prohibits any speech nor discriminates among speakers based on the content or viewpoint of their messages, its prohibition on compensation unquestionably imposes a significant burden on respondents' expressive activity by inducing them to curtail their expression if they wish to continue their employment. Moreover, the ban imposes a far more significant burden on them than on the relatively small group of lawmakers whose past receipt of honoraria assertedly motivated its enactment. The large-scale disincentive to expression also imposes a significant burden on the public's right to read and hear what Government employees would otherwise have written and said. Pp. 464-470. (b) The Government has failed to show how the interests it asserts to justify § 501(b) are served by applying the honoraria ban to respondents.  Public Workers  v.  Mitchell,  330 U. S. 75 , distinguished. Although the asserted concern that federal officers not misuse or appear to misuse power by accepting compensation for their unofficial and nonpolitical writing and speaking activities is undeniably powerful, the Government cites no evidence of misconduct related to honoraria by the vast rank and file of federal employees below grade GS-16. The limited evidence of actual or apparent impropriety by Members of Congress and highlevel executives cannot justify extension of the honoraria ban to that rank and file, an immense class of workers with negligible power to confer favors on those who might pay to hear them speak or to read their articles. Moreover, while operational efficiency is undoubtedly a vital governmental interest, several features of the text of the ban and of the pertinent regulations cast serious doubt on the Government's submission that Congress perceived honoraria as so threatening to the efficiency of the entire federal service as to render the ban a reasonable response to the threat. First, the total exemption of payments for ""any series of appearances, speeches, or articles"" unrelated to the employee's official duties or status from § 505(3)'s definition of ""honorarium"" undermines application of the ban to individual speeches and articles with no nexus to Government employment. Second, the definition's limitation of ""honoraria"" to payments for expressive activities, as opposed to other services that a Government employee might perform in his or her spare time, requires a justification far stronger than the mere speculation 456 about serious harms advanced by the Government. Finally, the regulations' exclusions from the coverage of the statutory terms ""appearance, speech or article"" of a wide variety of performances and writings that would normally appear to have no nexus with an employee's job are more consistent with the presumption that the federal work force consists of dedicated and honorable civil servants than with the honoraria ban's dubious application not merely to policymakers, whose loss of honoraria was offset by a salary increase, but to all Executive Branch employees below grade GS-16. Pp.470-477. (c) Insofar as the judgment below grants relief to senior federal executives who are not parties to this case, it is reversed as overinclusive. However, in light of this Court's obligation to avoid judicial legislation and its inability to correctly identify the exact terms of any nexus requirement that Congress would have adopted in a more limited honoraria ban, the Court refuses to modify the remedy further by crafting such a nexus requirement.

OHIO ELECTIONS COMMISSION CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO No. 93-986. Argued October 12, 1994-Decided April 19, 1995 After petitioner's decedent distributed leaflets purporting to express the views of ""CONCERNED PARENTS AND TAX PAYERS"" opposing a proposed school tax levy, she was fined by respondent for violating § 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Code, which prohibits the distribution of campaign literature that does not contain the name and address of the person or campaign official issuing the literature. The Court of Common Pleas reversed, but the Ohio Court of Appeals reinstated the fine. In affirming, the State Supreme Court held that the burdens § 3599.09(A) imposed on voters' First Amendment rights were ""reasonable"" and ""nondiscriminatory"" and therefore valid. Declaring that § 3599.09(A) is intended to identify persons who distribute campaign materials containing fraud, libel, or false advertising and to provide voters with a mechanism for evaluating such materials, the court distinguished  Talley  v.  California,  362 U. S. 60 , in which this Court invalidated an ordinance prohibiting all anonymous leafletting. Held:  Section 3599.09(A)'s prohibition of the distribution of anonymous campaign literature abridges the freedom of speech in violation of the First Amendment. Pp.341-357. (a) The freedom to publish anonymously is protected by the First Amendment, and, as  Talley  indicates, extends beyond the literary realm to the advocacy of political causes. Pp.341-343. (b) This Court's precedents make abundantly clear that the Ohio Supreme Court's reasonableness standard is significantly more lenient than is appropriate in a case of this kind. Although  Talley  concerned a different limitation than § 3599.09(A) and thus does not necessarily control here, the First Amendment's protection of anonymity nevertheless applies. Section 3599.09(A) is not simply an election code provision subject to the ""ordinary litigation"" test set forth in  Anderson  v.  Celebrezze,  460 U. S. 780 , and similar cases. Rather, it is a regulation of core political speech. Moreover, the category of documents it covers is defined by their content-only those publications containing speech designed to influence the voters in an election need bear the required information. See,  e.  g.,  First Nat. Bank of Boston  v.  Bellotti,  435 U. S. 765 ,776-777. When a law burdens such speech, the Court applies ""exacting scrutiny,"" 335 upholding the restriction only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest. See,  e.  g.,  id., at 786. Pp.343-347. (c) Section 3599.09(A)'s anonymous speech ban is not justified by Ohio's asserted interests in preventing fraudulent and libelous statements and in providing the electorate with relevant information. The claimed informational interest is plainly insufficient to support the statute's disclosure requirement, since the speaker's identity is no different from other components of a document's contents that the author is free to include or exclude, and the author's name and address add little to the reader's ability to evaluate the document in the case of a handbill written by a private citizen unknown to the reader. Moreover, the state interest in preventing fraud and libel (which Ohio vindicates by means of other, more direct prohibitions) does not justify § 3599.09(A)'s extremely broad prohibition of anonymous leaflets. The statute encompasses all documents, regardless of whether they are arguably false or misleading. Although a State might somehow demonstrate that its enforcement interests justify a more limited identification requirement, Ohio has not met that burden here. Pp. 348-353. (d) This Court's opinions in  Bellotti,  435 U. S., at 792, n. 32-which commented in dicta on the prophylactic effect of requiring identification of the source of corporate campaign advertising-and  Buckley  v.  Valeo,  424 U. S. 1 , 75-76-which approved mandatory disclosure of campaign-related expenditures-do not establish the constitutionality of § 3599.09(A), since neither case involved a prohibition of anonymous campaign literature.

COORS BREWING CO. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT No.93-1631. Argued November 30, 1994-Decided April 19, 1995 Because § 5(e)(2) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAAA or Act), 27 U. S. C. § 205(e)(2), prohibits beer labels from displaying alcohol content, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) rejected respondent brewer's application for approval of proposed labels that disclosed such content. Respondent filed suit for relief on the ground that the relevant provisions of the Act violated the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech. The Government argued that the labeling ban was necessary to suppress the threat of ""strength wars"" among brewers, who, without the regulation, would seek to compete in the marketplace based on the potency of their beer. The District Court invalidated the labeling ban, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Although the latter court found that the Government's interest in suppressing ""strength wars"" was ""substantial"" under the test set out in  Central Hudson Gas  &  Elec. Corp.  v.  Public Servo Comm'n of N.  Y.,  447 U. S. 557 , the court held that the ban violates the First Amendment because it fails to advance that interest in a direct and material way. Held:  Section 5(e)(2) violates the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech. Pp.480-491. (a) In scrutinizing a regulation of commercial speech that concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, a court must consider whether the governmental interest asserted to support the regulation is ""substantial."" If that is the case, the court must also determine whether the regulation directly advances the asserted interest and is no more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.  Central Hudson, supra,  at 566. Here, respondent seeks to disclose only truthful, verifiable, and nonmisleading factual information concerning alcohol content. Pp.480-482. (b) The interest in curbing ""strength wars"" is sufficiently ""substantial"" to satisfy  Central Hudson.  The Government has a significant interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens by preventing brewers from competing on the basis of alcohol strength, which could lead to greater alcoholism and its attendant social costs. Cf.  Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates  v.  Tourism Co. of P. R.,  478 U. S. 328 , 341. There is no reason to think that strength wars, if they were 477 to occur, would not produce the type of social harm that the Government hopes to prevent. However, the additional asserted interest in ""facilitat[ing]"" state efforts to regulate alcohol under the Twenty-first Amendment is not sufficiently substantial to meet  Central Hudson's  requirement. Even if the Government possessed the authority to facilitate state powers, the Government has offered nothing to suggest that States are in need of federal assistance in this regard.  United States  v.  Edge Broadcasting Co.,  509 U. S. 418 , 431-435, distinguished. pp. 483-486. (c) Section 205(e)(2) fails  Central Hudson's  requirement that the measure directly advance the asserted Government interest. The labeling ban cannot be said to advance the governmental interest in suppressing strength wars because other provisions of the FAAA and implementing regulations prevent § 205(e )(2) from furthering that interest in a direct and material fashion. Although beer advertising would seem to constitute a more influential weapon in any strength war than labels, the BATF regulations governing such advertising prohibit statements of alcohol content only in States that affirmatively ban such advertisements. Government regulations also permit the identification of certain beers with high alcohol content as ""malt liquors,"" and they require disclosure of content on the labels of wines and spirits. There is little chance that § 205(e)(2) can directly and materially advance its aim, while other provisions of the same Act directly undermine and counteract its effects. Pp. 486-490. (d) Section 205(e)(2) is more extensive than necessary, since available alternatives to the labeling ban-including directly limiting the alcohol content of beers, prohibiting marketing efforts emphasizing high alcohol strength, and limiting the ban to malt liquors, the segment of the beer market that allegedly is threatened with a strength war-would prove less intrusive to the First Amendment's protections for commercial speech. Pp.490-491. 2 F.3d 355 , affirmed. THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and O'CONNOR, SCALIA, KENNEDY, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., joined.

No. 94-749. Argued April 25, 1995-Decided June 19, 1995 Petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated association of individuals elected from various veterans groups, was authorized by the city of Boston to organize and conduct the St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation Day Parade. The Council refused a place in the 1993 event to respondent GLIB, an organization formed for the purpose of marching in the parade in order to express its members' pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to show that there are such individuals in the community, and to support the like men and women who sought to march in the New York St. Patrick's Day parade. GLIB and some of its members filed this suit in state court, alleging that the denial of their application to march violated,  inter alia,  a state law prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. In finding such a violation and ordering the Council to include GLIB in the parade, the trial court, among other things, concluded that the parade had no common theme other than the involvement of the participants, and that, given the Council's lack of selectivity in choosing parade participants and its failure to circumscribe the marchers' messages, the parade lacked any expressive purpose, such that GLIB's inclusion therein would not violate the Council's First Amendment rights. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed. Held:  The state courts' application of the Massachusetts public accommodations law to require private citizens who organize a parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message that the organizers do not wish to convey violates the First Amendment. Pp. 566-581. (a) Confronted with the state courts' conclusion that the factual characteristics of petitioners' activity place it within the realm of nonexpressive conduct, this Court has a constitutional duty to conduct an independent examination of the record as a whole, without deference to those courts, to assure that their judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field offree expression. See,  e.  g.,  New York Times Co.  v.  Sullivan,  376 U. S. 254 , 285. Pp. 566-568. 558 
Syllabus (b) The selection of contingents to make a parade is entitled to First Amendment protection. Parades such as petitioners' are a form of protected expression because they include marchers who are making some sort of collective point, not just to each other but to bystanders along the way. Cf.,  e. g., Gregory  v.  Chicago,  394 U. S. 111 , 112. Moreover, such protection is not limited to a parade's banners and songs, but extends to symbolic acts. See,  e. g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed.  v.  Barnette,  319 U. S. 624 , 632, 642. Although the Council has been rather lenient in admitting participants to its parade, a private speaker does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices, by failing to edit their themes to isolate a specific message as the exclusive subject matter of the speech, or by failing to generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the communication. Thus, petitioners are entitled to protection under the First Amendment. GLIB's participation as a unit in the parade was equally expressive, since the organization was formed to celebrate its members' sexual identities and for related purposes. Pp. 568-570. (c) The Massachusetts law does not, as a general matter, violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments. Its provisions are well within a legislature's power to enact when it has reason to believe that a given group is being discriminated against. And the statute does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate on the basis of its content. Pp.571-572. (d) The state court's application, however, had the effect of declaring the sponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation. Since every participating parade unit affects the message conveyed by the private organizers, the state courts' peculiar application of the Massachusetts law essentially forced the Council to alter the parade's expressive content and thereby violated the fundamental First Amendment rule that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message and, conversely, to decide what not to say. Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle is sound, since the Council selects the expressive units of the parade from potential participants and clearly decided to exclude a message it did not like from the communication it chose to make, and that is enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to shape its expression by speaking on one subject while remaining silent on another, free from state interference. The constitutional violation is not saved by  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.  v.  FCC,  512 U. S. 622 . The Council is a speaker in its own right; a parade does not consist of individual, unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted together for individual selection by members of the audience; and there is no assertion here that some speakers will be destroyed in the absence of 559 the Massachusetts law. Nor has any other legitimate interest been identified in support of applying that law in the way done by the state courts to expressive activity like the parade.  PruneYard Shopping Center  v.  Robins,  447 U. S. 74 ,87, and  New York State Club Assn., Inc.  v.  City of New York,  487 U. S. 1 , 13, distinguished. Pp. 572-581. 418 Mass. 238, 636 N. E. 2d 1293, reversed and remanded.

RECTOR AND VISITORS OF UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT 
No. 94-329. Argued March 1, 1995-Decided June 29,1995 Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorizes payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to outside contractors for the printing costs of a variety of publications issued by student groups called ""Contracted Independent Organizations"" (CIO's). The SAF receives its money from mandatory student fees and is designed to support a broad range of extracurricular student activities related to the University's educational purpose. CIO's must include in their dealings with third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer stating that they are independent of the University and that the University is not responsible for them. The University withheld authorization for payments to a printer on behalf of petitioners' CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely because its student newspaper, Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia, ""primarily promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,"" as prohibited by the University's SAF Guidelines. Petitioners filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging,  inter alia,  that the refusal to authorize payment violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. After the District Court granted summary judgment for the University, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the University's invocation of viewpoint discrimination to deny third-party payment violated the Speech Clause, but concluding that the discrimination was justified by the necessity of complying with the Establishment Clause. Held: 1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their right of free speech. Pp. 828-837. (a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under,  e.  g.,  Perry Ed. Assn.  v.  Perry Local Educators' Assn.,  460 U. S. 37 , 46-47. In determining whether a State is acting within its power to preserve the limits it has set for such a forum so that the exclusion of a class of speech there is legitimate, see,  e.  g., id., at 49, this Court has observed a distinction between, on the one hand, content discrimination-i.  e.,  discrimination 820 
Syllabus against speech because of its subject matter-which may be permissible if it preserves the limited forum's purposes, and, on the other hand, viewpoint discrimination-i.  e.,  discrimination because of the speaker's specific motivating ideology, opinion, or perspective-which is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations, see id., at 46. The most recent and most apposite case in this area is  Lamb's Chapel  v.  Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,  508 U. S. 384 , 393, in which the Court held that permitting school property to be used for the presentation of all views on an issue except those dealing with it from a religious standpoint constitutes prohibited viewpoint discrimination. Here, as in that case, the State's actions are properly interpreted as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination rather than permissible line-drawing based on content: By the very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints. Pp. 828-832. (b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of  Lamb's Chapel  by urging that this case involves the provision of funds rather than access to facilities is unavailing. Although it may regulate the content of expression when it is the speaker or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message,  Rust  v.  Sullivan,  500 U. S. 173 ;  Widmar  v.  Vincent,  454 U. S. 263 , 276, the University may not discriminate based on the viewpoint of private persons whose speech it subsidizes,  Regan  v.  Taxation with Representation of Wash.,  461 U. S. 540 , 548. Its argument that the scarcity of public money may justify otherwise impermissible viewpoint discrimination among private speakers is simply wrong. Pp. 832-835. (c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach: The term ""promotes"" as used there would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in a deity or ultimate reality, while the term ""manifests"" would bring within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise presupposing the existence (or nonexistence) of a deity or ultimate reality. It is difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy. pp.835-837. 2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of complying with the Establishment Clause. Pp. 837-846. (a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward religion. Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack, and the guarantee of neutrality is not 821 offended where, as here, the government follows neutral criteria and evenhanded policies to extend benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse,  Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist.  v.  Grumet,  512 U. S. 687 , 704. There is no suggestion that the University created its program to advance religion or aid a religious cause. The SAF's purpose is to open a forum for speech and to support various student enterprises, including the publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life. The SAF Guidelines have a separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments on behalf of, ""religious organizations,"" and WAP did not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial viewpoint; it sought funding under the Guidelines as a ""student ... communications ... grou[p]."" Neutrality is also apparent in the fact that the University has taken pains to disassociate itself from the private speech involved in this case. The program's neutrality distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied for the direct support of a church or group of churches, which would violate the Establishment Clause. Pp. 837-842. (b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions, see,  e. g., Roemer  v.  Board of Public Works of Md.,  426 U. S. 736 , 747, since it is undisputed that no public funds flow directly into WAP's coffers under the program at issue. A public university does not violate the Establishment Clause when it grants access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide spectrum of student groups, even if some of those groups would use the facilities for devotional exercises. See  e. g., Widmar,  454 U. S., at 269. This is so even where the upkeep, maintenance, and repair of those facilities are paid out of a student activities fund to which students are required to contribute.  Id.,  at 265. There is no difference in logic or principle, and certainly no difference of constitutional significance, between using such funds to operate a facility to which students have access, and paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its behalf. That is all that is involved here: The University provides printing services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers. Were the contrary view to become law, the University could only avoid a constitutional violation by scrutinizing the content of student speech, lest it contain too great a religious message. Such censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis.

In concluding that the ban was unconstitutional because it did not directly advance the State's asserted interest in the promotion of temperance and was more extensive than necessary to serve that interest, the District Court reasoned that the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it and that the Twenty-first Amendment did not shift or diminish that burden. In reversing, the Court of Appeals,  inter alia,  found ""inherent merit"" in the State's submission that competitive price advertising would ultimately increase sales, and agreed with it that the Twenty-first Amendment gave its advertising ban an added presumption of validity. Held:  The judgment is reversed.  39 F.3d 5 , reversed."

No. 95-489. Argued April 15, 1996-Decided June 26, 1996 Before the Colorado Republican Party selected its 1986 senatorial candidate, its Federal Campaign Committee (Colorado Party), a petitioner here, bought radio advertisements attacking the Democratic Party's likely candidate. The Federal Election Commission (FE C) brought suit charging that the Colorado Party had violated the ""Party Expenditure Provision"" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 2 U. S. C. § 441a(d)(3), which imposes dollar limits upon political party ""expenditure[s] in connection with the general election campaign of a [congressional] candidate."" The Colorado Party defended in part by claiming that the expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment as applied to its advertisements, and filed a counterclaim seeking to raise a facial challenge to the provision as a whole. The District Court interpreted the ""in connection with"" language narrowly and held that the provision did not cover the expenditure at issue. It therefore entered summary judgment for the Colorado Party, dismissing the counterclaim as moot. In ordering judgment for the FEC, the Court of Appeals adopted a somewhat broader interpretation of the provision, which, it said, both covered this expenditure and satisfied the Constitution. Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.  59 F.3d 1015 , vacated and remanded."

UMBEHR CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT No. 94-1654. Argued November 28, 1995-Decided June 28,1996 During the term of his at-will contract with Wabaunsee County, Kansas (County), to haul trash, respondent Umbehr was an outspoken critic of petitioner Board of County Commissioners (Board). After the commissioners voted to terminate (or prevent the automatic renewal of) the contract, allegedly because they took Umbehr's criticism badly, he brought this suit against two of them under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The District Court granted them summary judgment, but the Tenth Circuit reversed in relevant part and remanded, holding that the First Amendment protects independent contractors from governmental retaliation against their speech, and that the extent of that protection must be determined by weighing the government's interests as contractor against the free speech interests at stake in accordance with the balancing test applied in the government employment context under  Pickering  v.  Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391  U. S. 563, 568. Held:  The First Amendment protects independent contractors from the termination or prevention of automatic renewal of at-will government contracts in retaliation for their exercise of the freedom of speech, and the  Pickering  balancing test, adjusted to weigh the government's interests as contractor rather than as employer, determines the extent of that protection. Pp. 673-686. (a) Because of the obvious similarities between government employees and government contractors with respect to this issue, the Court is guided by its government employment precedents. Among other things, those precedents have recognized that government workers are constitutionally protected from dismissal for publicly or privately criticizing their employer's policies, see,  e. g., Perry  v.  Sindermann,  408 U. S. 593 , but have also acknowledged that the First Amendment does not guarantee absolute freedom of speech, see,  e.  g.,  Connick  v.  Myers,  461 U. S. 138 , 146, and have required a fact-sensitive and deferential weighing of the government employer's legitimate interests against its employees' First Amendment rights, see,  e. g., Pickering, supra,  at 568. The parties' attempts to differentiate between inde- 669 pendent contractors and government employees are unavailing. Each of their arguments for and against the imposition of liability has some force, but all of them can be accommodated by applying the existing government employee framework. Moreover, application of the nuanced  Pickering  approach is superior to a bright-line rule giving the government  carte blanche  to terminate independent contractors for exercising their speech rights. Although both the individual's and the government's interests are typically-though not always-somewhat less strong in an independent contractor case, the fact that such contractors are similar in most relevant respects to government employees compels the conclusion that the same form of balancing analysis should apply to each. Pp. 673-681. (b) Neither the dissent's fears of excessive litigation, nor its assertion that the allocation of government contracts on the basis of political bias is a longstanding tradition, can deprive independent contractors of protection. Its own description of ""lowest-responsible-bidder"" requirements in a wide range of government contracting laws voluntarily adopted by federal and state authorities suggests that government contracting norms incompatible with political bias have proliferated without unduly burdening the government, and such laws have a long history. Pp. 681-685. (c) Because the courts below assumed that Umbehr's termination (or nonrenewal) was in retaliation for his protected speech activities, and did not pass on the balance between the government's interests and his free speech interests, the conclusion that independent contractors do enjoy some First Amendment protection requires affirmance of the Tenth Circuit's decision to remand the case. To prevail, Umbehr must show initially that the termination of his contract was motivated by his speech on a matter of public concern, see  Connick, supra,  at 146; he must therefore prove more than the mere fact that he criticized the Board members before he was terminated. If he can do so, the Board will have a valid defense if it can show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that, in light of their knowledge, perceptions, and policies at the time of the termination, the Board members would have terminated the contract regardless of his speech. See  Mt. Healthy City Ed. of Ed.  v.  Doyle,  429 U. S. 274 ,287. The Board will also prevail if it can demonstrate that the County's legitimate interests as contractor, deferentially viewed, outweigh the free speech interests at stake. See,  e. g., Pickering, supra,  at 568. And, if Umbehr prevails, evidence that the Board members discovered facts after termination that would have led to a later termination anyway, and evidence of mitigation of his loss by means of subsequent trash hauling contracts with cities in the County, would be relevant in assessing the appropriate remedy. Because 670 670 BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY.  v.  UMBEHR Umbehr's suit concerns the termination or nonrenewal of a pre-existing commercial relationship with the government, this Court need not address the possibility of suits by bidders or applicants for new government contracts who cannot rely on such a relationship.

CITY OF NORTHLAKE ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT 
No.95-191. Argued March 20, 1996-Decided June 28,1996 Respondent city maintains a rotation list of available companies to perform towing services at its request. Until the events recounted here, the city's policy had been to remove companies from the list only for cause. Petitioner O'Hare Truck Service, Inc., was removed from the list after its owner, petitioner Gratzianna, refused to contribute to respondent mayor's reelection campaign and instead supported his opponent. Alleging that the removal was in retaliation for Gratzianna's campaign stance and caused petitioners to lose substantial income, petitioners filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The District Court dismissed the complaint in conformity with Seventh Circuit precedent that  Elrod  v.  Burns,  427 U. S. 347  (plurality opinion), and  Branti  v.  Finkel,  445 U. S. 507 -in which the Court held that government officials may not discharge public employees for refusing to support a political party or its candidates, unless political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the job in question-do not extend to independent contractors. The Seventh Circuit affirmed. Held:  The protections of  Elrod  and  Branti  extend to an instance where government retaliates against a contractor, or a regular provider of services, for the exercise of rights of political association or the expression of political allegiance. Pp. 716-726. (a) In assessing when party affiliation, consistent with the First Amendment, may be an acceptable basis for terminating a public employee, ""the ultimate inquiry is not whether the label 'policymaker' or 'confidential' fits a particular position; rather, the question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.""  Branti, supra,  at 518. A different, though related, inquiry, the balancing test from  Pickering  v.  Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,  391 U. S. 563 , is called for where a government employer takes adverse action on account of an employee or service provider's right offree speech. In  Elrod  and  Branti,  the raw test of political affiliation sufficed to show a constitutional violation. However, since the inquiry is whether the affiliation requirement is reasonable, it is inevitable that some case-by-case adjudication will be required even 713 where political affiliation was the test the government imposed. The analysis will also accommodate cases where instances of the employee's speech or expression are intermixed with a political affiliation requirement. Pp.716-720. (b) Despite respondents' argument that the principles of  Elrod  and  Branti  have no force here because an independent contractor's First Amendment rights, unlike a public employee's, must yield to the government's asserted countervailing interest in sustaining a patronage system, this Court cannot accept the proposition that those who perform the government's work outside the formal employment relationship are subject to the direct and specific abridgment of First Amendment rights described in petitioners' complaint. The government may not coerce support in the manner petitioners allege, unless it has some justification beyond dislike of the individual's political association. As respondents offer no other justification for their actions, the complaint states a First Amendment claim. Allowing the constitutional claim to turn on a distinction between employees and independent contractors would invite manipulation by government, which could avoid constitutional liability simply by attaching different labels to particular jobs,  Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty.  v.  Umbehr, ante,  at 679. Accord,  Lefkowitz  v.  Turley,  414 U. S. 70 . Respondents present no convincing data to support their speculation that a difference of constitutional magnitude exists because independent contractors are less dependent on the government for income than employees are. There is little reason to suppose that a decision in petitioners' favor will lead to numerous lawsuits. While government officials may terminate at-will relationships, unmodified by any legal constraints, without cause, it does not follow that this discretion can be exercised to impose conditions on expressing, or not expressing, specific political views, see  Perry  v.  Sindermann,  408 U. S. 593 , 597. In view of the large number of legitimate reasons why a contracting decision might be made, fending off baseless First Amendment lawsuits should not consume scarce government resources. If the government terminates its affiliation with a service provider for reasons unrelated to political association,  Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.  v.  Doyle,  429 U. S. 274 , 287, as, for example, where the provider is unreliable, or if the service provider's political ""affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance"" of the task in question,  Branti, supra,  at 518, there will be no First Amendment violation. The absolute right to enforce a patronage scheme as a means of retaining control over independent contractors and satisfying government officials' concerns about reliability has not been shown to be a necessary part of a legitimate political system in all instances. This was the determination controlling the Court's decisions in  Elrod, supra,  at 365-368, 372-373, 714 and  Branti, supra,  at 518-520. There is no basis for rejecting that reasoning in this context and drawing a line excluding independent contractors from the First Amendment safeguards of political association afforded to employees. Pp.720-726. (c) The lower courts, upon such further proceedings as are deemed appropriate, should decide whether the case is governed by the  ElrodBranti  rule or by the  Pickering  rule.

In  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.  v.  FCC,  512 U. S. 622   (Turner),  this Court held these so-called ""must-carry"" provisions to be subject to intermediate First Amendment scrutiny under  United States  v.  O'Brien,  391 U. S. 367 , 377, whereby a content-neutral regulation will be sustained if it advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests. However, because a plurality considered the record as then developed insufficient to determine whether the provisions would in fact alleviate real harms in a direct and material way and would not burden substantially more speech than necessary, the Court remanded the case. After 18 months of additional factfinding, the District Court granted summary judgment for the Government and other appellees, concluding that the expanded record contained substantial evidence supporting Congress' predictive judgment that the must-carry provisions further important governmental interests in preserving cable carriage of local broadcast stations, and that the provisions are narrowly tailored to promote those interests. This direct appeal followed. Held:  The judgment is affirmed. 910 F. Supp. 734, affirmed."

FELTON ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
No. 96-552. Argued April 15, 1997-Decided June 23,1997* In  Aguilar  v.  Felton,  473 U. S. 402 , 413, this Court held that New York City's program that sent public school teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial education to disadvantaged children pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 necessitated an excessive entanglement of church and state and violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. On remand, the District Court entered a permanent injunction reflecting that ruling. Some 10 years later, petitioners-the parties bound by the injunction-filed motions in the same court seeking relief from the injunction's operation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). They emphasized the significant costs of complying with  Aguilar  and the assertions of five Justices in  Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist.  v.  Grumet,  512 U. S. 687 , that  Aguilar  should be reconsidered, and argued that relief was proper under Rule 60(b)(5) and  Rufo  v.  Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,  502 U. S. 367 , 388, because  Aguilar  cannot be squared with this Court's intervening Establishment Clause jurisprudence and is no longer good law. The District Court denied the motion on the merits, declaring that  Aguilar's  demise has ""not yet occurred."" The Second Circuit agreed and affirmed. Held: 1. A federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not invalid under the Establishment Clause when such instruction is given on the premises of sectarian schools by government employees under a program containing safeguards such as those present in New York City's Title I program. Accordingly,  Aguilar,  as well as that portion of its companion case,  School Dist. of Grand Rapids  v.  Ball,  473 U. S. 373 , addressing a ""Shared Time"" program, are no longer good law. Pp. 215-236. (a) Under  Rufo, supra,  at 384, Rule 60(b)(5)-which states that, ""upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment ... [when] it is no longer equitable that the judgment *Together with No. 96-553, Chancellor, Board of Education of the City of New York, et al. v. Felton et al., also on certiorari to the same court. 204 Syllabus should have prospective application""-authorizes relief from an injunction if the moving party shows a significant change either in factual conditions or in law. Since the exorbitant costs of complying with the injunction were known at the time  Aguilar  was decided, see,  e. g., 473  U. S., at 430-431 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), they do not constitute a change in factual conditions sufficient to warrant relief, accord,  Rufo, supra,  at 385. Also unavailing is the fact that five Justices in  Kiryas Joel  expressed the view that  Aguilar  should be reconsidered or overruled. Because the question of  Aguilar's  propriety was not before the Court in that case, those Justices' views cannot be said to have effected a change in Establishment Clause law. Thus, petitioners' ability to satisfy Rule 60(b)(5)'s prerequisites hinges on whether the Court's later Establishment Clause cases have so undermined  Aguilar  that it is no longer good law. Pp. 215-218. (b) To answer that question, it is necessary to understand the rationale upon which  Aguilar  and  Ball  rested. One of the programs evaluated in  Ball  was the Grand Rapids, Michigan, Shared Time program, which is analogous to New York City's Title I program. Applying the three-part  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403 U. S. 602 , 612-613, test, the  Ball  Court acknowledged that the Shared Time program satisfied the test's first element in that it served a purely secular purpose, 473 U. S., at 383, but ultimately concluded that it had the impermissible effect of advancing religion, in violation of the test's second element, id., at 385. That conclusion rested on three assumptions: (i) any public employee who works on a religious school's premises is presumed to inculcate religion in her work, see id., at 385-389; (ii) the presence of public employees on private school premises creates an impermissible symbolic union between church and state, see id., at 389, 391; and (iii) any public aid that directly aids the educational function of religious schools impermissibly finances religious indoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as a consequence of private decisionmaking, see id., at 385, 393, 395-397. Additionally,  Aguilar  set forth a fourth assumption: that New York City's Title I program necessitates an excessive government entanglement with religion, in violation of the  Lemon  test's third element, because public employees who teach on religious school premises must be closely monitored to ensure that they do not inculcate religion. See 473 U. S., at 409, 412-414. Pp. 218-222. (c) The Court's more recent cases have undermined the assumptions upon which  Ball  and  Aguilar  relied. Contrary to  Aguilar's  conclusion, placing full-time government employees on parochial school campuses does not as a matter of law have the impermissible effect of advancing religion through indoctrination. Subsequent cases have modified in two significant respects the approach the Court uses to as- 205 sess whether the government has impermissibly advanced religion by inculcating religious beliefs. First, the Court has abandoned  Ball's  presumption that public employees placed on parochial school grounds will inevitably inculcate religion or that their presence constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.  Zobrest  v.  Catalina Foothills School Dist.,  509 U. S. 1 , 12-13. No evidence has ever shown that any New York City instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students. Second, the Court has departed from  Ball's  rule that all government aid that directly aids the educational function of religious schools is invalid.  Witters  v.  Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind,  474 U. S. 481 , 487;  Zobrest, supra,  at 10, 12. In all relevant respects, the provision of the instructional services here at issue is indistinguishable from the provision of a sign-language interpreter in  Zobrest. Zobrest  and  Witters  make clear that, under current law, the Shared Time program in  Ball  and New York City's Title I program will not, as a matter of law, be deemed to have the effect of advancing religion through indoctrination. Thus, both this Court's precedent and its experience require rejection of the premises upon which  Ball  relied. Pp. 222-230. (d) New York City's Title I program does not give aid recipients any incentive to modify their religious beliefs or practices in order to obtain program services. Although  Ball  and  Aguilar  completely ignored this consideration, other Establishment Clause cases before and since have examined the criteria by which an aid program identifies its beneficiaries to determine whether the criteria themselves have the effect of advancing religion by creating a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination. Cf.,  e. g., Witters, supra,  at 488;  Zobrest, supra,  at 10. Such an incentive is not present where, as here, the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis. Under such circumstances, the aid is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion. See  Widmar  v.  Vincent,  454 U. S. 263 , 274. New York City's Title I services are available to all children who meet the eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school. Pp.230-232. (e) The  Aguilar  Court erred in concluding that New York City's Title I program resulted in an excessive entanglement between church and state. Regardless of whether entanglement is considered in the course of assessing if a program has an impermissible effect of advancing religion,  Walz  v.  Tax Comm'n of City of New York,  397 U. S. 664 , 674, or as a factor separate and apart from ""effect,""  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403 U. S., at 612-613, the considerations used to assess its exces- 206 Syllabus siveness are similar: The Court looks to the character and purposes of the benefited institutions, the nature of the aid that the State provides, and the resulting relationship between the government and religious authority.  Id.,  at 615. It is simplest to recognize why entanglement is significant and treat it-as the Court did in  Walz-as  an aspect of the inquiry into a statute's effect. The  Aguilar  Court's finding of ""excessive"" entanglement rested on three grounds: (i) the program would require ""pervasive monitoring by public authorities"" to ensure that Title I employees did not inculcate religion; (ii) the program required ""administrative cooperation"" between the government and parochial schools; and (iii) the program might increase the dangers of ""political divisiveness."" 473 U. S., at 413-414. Under the Court's current Establishment Clause understanding, the last two considerations are insufficient to create an ""excessive entanglement"" because they are present no matter where Title I services are offered, but no court has held that Title I services cannot be offered off campus.  E. g., Aguilar, supra.  Further, the first consideration has been undermined by  Zobrest.  Because the Court in  Zobrest  abandoned the presumption that public employees will inculcate religion simply because they happen to be in a sectarian environment, there is no longer any need to assume that  pervasive  monitoring of Title I teachers is required. There is no suggestion in the record that the system New York City has in place to monitor Title I employees is insufficient to prevent or to detect inculcation. Moreover, the Court has failed to find excessive entanglement in cases involving far more onerous burdens on religious institutions. See  Bowen  v.  Kendrick, 487  U. S. 589, 615-617. Pp. 232-235. (f) Thus, New York City's Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria the Court currently uses to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination, define its recipients by reference to religion, or create an excessive entanglement. Nor can this carefully constrained program reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion. pp. 234-235. (g) The  stare decisis  doctrine does not preclude this Court from recognizing the change in its law and overruling  Aguilar  and those portions of  Ball  that are inconsistent with its more recent decisions.  E. g., United States  v.  Gaudin,  515 U. S. 506 , 521. Moreover, in light of the Court's conclusion that  Aguilar  would be decided differently under current Establishment Clause law, adherence to that decision would undoubtedly work a ""manifest injustice,"" such that the law of the case doctrine does not apply. Accord,  Davis  v.  United States,  417 U. S. 333 , 342. Pp. 235-236. 207 2. The significant change in this Court's  post-Aguilar  Establishment Clause law entitles petitioners to relief under Rule 60(b)(5). The Court's general practice is to apply the rule of law it is announcing to the parties before it,  Rodriguez de Quijas  v.  Shears on/American Express, Inc.,  490 U. S. 477 , 485, even when it is overruling a case,  e. g., Adarand Constructors, Inc.  v.  Pena,  515 U. S. 200 , 237-238. The Court neither acknowledges nor holds that other courts should ever conclude that its more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier precedent. Rather, lower courts should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.  Rodriguez de Quijas, supra,  at 484. Respondents' various arguments as to why relief should not be granted in this litigation-that a different analysis is required because the Court is here reviewing for abuse of discretion the District Court's denial of relief; that petitioners' unprecedented use of Rule 60(b)(5) as a vehicle for  effecting  changes in the law, rather than as a means of  recognizing  them, will encourage litigants to burden the federal courts with a deluge of Rule 60(b)(5) motions; that petitioners' use of Rule 60(b) in this context will erode the Court's institutional integrity; and that the Court should wait for a ""better vehicle"" in which to evaluate  Aguilar's  continuing vitality-are not persuasive. Pp.237-240. 101 F.3d 1394 , reversed and remanded. O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and SCALIA, KENNEDY, and THOMAS, JJ., joined.

WILEMAN BROTHERS & ELLIOTT, INC., ETAL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT No. 95-1184. Argued December 2, 1996-Decided June 25,1997 Respondents, California tree fruitgrowers, handlers, and processors, initiated administrative proceedings challenging the validity of various regulations contained in marketing orders promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (AMAA). Congress enacted the AMAA to establish and maintain orderly agricultural-commodity marketing conditions and fair prices; the program, which is expressly exempted from the antitrust laws, displaces competition in favor of collective action in the discrete markets regulated. AMAA marketing orders set uniform prices, product standards, and other conditions for all producers in a particular market; must be approved by two-thirds of the affected producers; are implemented by committees of producers appointed by the Secretary; and impose assessments on producers for the expenses of their administration, including product advertising and promotion. The orders at issue assessed respondents for,  inter alia,  the cost of generic advertising of California nectarines, plums, and peaches. After the Department of Agriculture upheld the generic advertising regulations, respondents sought review in this action, which was consolidated with enforcement actions brought by the Secretary. The District Court upheld the orders and entered judgment for the Secretary, but the Ninth Circuit held that the Government enforced contributions to pay for generic advertising violated respondents' commercial speech rights under the test set forth in  Central Hudson Gas  &  Elec. Corp.  v.  Public Servo Comm'n of N.  Y.,  447 U. S. 557 ,566. Held:  The requirement that respondents finance generic advertising does not violate the First Amendment. Pp.467-477. (a) Respondents' claimed disagreement with the content of some of the advertising at issue has no bearing on the validity of the entire generic advertising program. The Ninth Circuit invalidated that program under  Central Hudson  because the Government failed to prove that such advertising was more effective than individual advertising in increasing consumer demand for California tree fruits. The factual assumption that generic advertising may not be the most effective 458 458 GLICKMAN  v.  WILEMAN BROTHERS & ELLIOTT, INC. 
Syllabus method to promote these commodities is neither accepted nor rejected by this Court, which instead stresses the importance of the statutory context in which the question at issue arises. Under the AMAA, detailed marketing orders have displaced many aspects of independent business activity characterizing other portions of the economy in which competition is fully protected by the antitrust laws. Business entities are compelled to fund generic advertising as part of a broader collective enterprise in which the regulatory scheme already constrains their freedom to act independently. It is in this context that the Court considers whether to review the assessments at issue under the standard appropriate to economic regulation or under a heightened First Amendment standard. Pp. 467-469. (b) The Ninth Circuit erred in relying on  Central Hudson  to test the constitutionality of market order assessments for promotional advertising. Three characteristics of the generic advertising scheme distinguish it from laws this Court has found to abridge free speech. First, the marketing orders impose no restraint on any respondents' freedom to communicate any message to any audience. Second, they do not compel anyone to engage in any actual or symbolic speech. Cf.,  e. g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed.  v.  Barnette,  319 U. S. 624 , 632. Third, they do not compel anyone to endorse or to finance any political or ideological views. Cf.,  e. g., Wooley  v.  Maynard,  430 U. S. 705 . Indeed, since respondents market California tree fruits, they may all be presumed to agree with the central message of the speech generated by the generic program. Thus, none of the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence supports the suggestion that the promotional regulations should be scrutinized under a different standard from that applicable to the marketing orders' other anticompetitive features. Respondents' criticisms of the generic advertising and their contention that the assessments reduce the sums respondents use to conduct their own advertising provide no basis for concluding that accurate advertising constitutes an abridgment of anybody's right to speak freely. Nor does the First Amendment forbid all compelled financial contributions to fund advertising.  Abood  v.  Detroit Bd. of Ed.,  431 U. S. 209 , and the cases that follow it, prohibit compelled contributions for expressive activities that conflict with one's freedom of belief. The advertising here does not promote any particular message with which respondents disagree. The fact that respondents may prefer to foster that message in other ways does not make this case comparable to those involving political or ideological disagreement. Moreover, some of the relevant cases suggest that assessments to fund a lawful collective program may be used to pay for nonideological speech over the objection of some members of the group if the speech is germane to the purpose for which the compelled association was justified. 459 See,  e. g., Keller  v.  State Bar of Cal.,  496 U. S. 1 , 13-14. This test is clearly satisfied here because (1) the generic advertising of California tree fruit is unquestionably germane to the marketing orders' purposes and, (2) in any event, the assessments are not used to fund ideological activities. Although the wisdom of the generic advertising program may be questioned, its debatable features are insufficient to warrant special First Amendment scrutiny. Pp.469-474. (c) The Ninth Circuit's decision to apply the  Central Hudson  test is inconsistent with the very nature and purpose of the collective action program at issue. The AMAA rests on an assumption that in the volatile agricultural commodities markets the public will be best served by compelling cooperation among producers in making economic decisions that would be made independently in a free market. The First Amendment does not provide a basis for reviewing such economic regulation, which enjoys the same strong presumption of validity that this Court accords to other policy judgments made by Congress. Appropriate respect for Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce provides abundant support for the marketing orders' constitutionality. Generic advertising is intended to stimulate consumer demand for an agricultural product in a regulated market. That purpose is legitimate and consistent with the regulatory goals of the overall statutory scheme. The mere fact that one or more producers do not wish to foster generic advertising of their product is not a sufficient reason for judges to override the judgment of the majority of market participants, bureaucrats, and legislators that such programs are beneficial.

FLORES, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN ANTONIO, ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT No. 95-2074. Argued February 19, 1997-Decided June 25,1997 Respondent, the Catholic Archbishop of San Antonio, applied for a building permit to enlarge a church in Boerne, Texas. When local zoning authorities denied the permit, relying on an ordinance governing historic preservation in a district which, they argued, included the church, the Archbishop brought this suit challenging the permit denial under,  inter alia,  the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). The District Court concluded that by enacting RFRA Congress exceeded the scope of its enforcement power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal, and the Fifth Circuit reversed, finding RFRA to be constitutional. Held:  RFRA exceeds Congress' power. pp. 512-536. (a) Congress enacted RFRA in direct response to  Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.  v.  Smith,  494 U. S. 872 , in which the Court upheld against a free exercise challenge a state law of general applicability criminalizing peyote use, as applied to deny unemployment benefits to Native American Church members who lost their jobs because of such use. In so ruling, the Court declined to apply the balancing test of  Sherbert  v.  Verner,  374 U. S. 398 , which asks whether the law at issue substantially burdens a religious practice and, if so, whether the burden is justified by a compelling government interest. RFRA prohibits ""[g]overnment"" from ""substantially burden[ing]"" a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless the government can demonstrate the burden ""(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that ... interest."" 42 U. S. C. § 2000bb-1. RFRA's mandate applies to any branch of Federal or State Government, to all officials, and to other persons acting under color of law. § 2000bb-2(1). Its universal coverage includes ""all Federal and State law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after [RFRA's enactment]."" § 2000bb-3(a). Pp. 512-516. (b) In imposing RFRA's requirements on the States, Congress relied on the Fourteenth Amendment, which,  inter alia,  guarantees that no State shall make or enforce any law depriving any person of ""life, lib- 508 Syllabus erty, or property, without due process of law,"" or denying any person the ""equal protection of the laws,"" § 1, and empowers Congress ""to enforce"" those guarantees by ""appropriate legislation,"" § 5. Respondent Archbishop and the United States contend that RFRA is permissible enforcement legislation under § 5. Although Congress certainly can enact legislation enforcing the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion, see,  e. g., Cantwell  v.  Connecticut,  310 U. S. 296 , 303, its § 5 power ""to enforce"" is only preventive or ""remedial,""  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach,  383 U. S. 301 , 326. The Amendment's design and § 5's text are inconsistent with any suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the Amendment's restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the Free Exercise Clause's meaning cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. While the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and Congress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction exists and must be observed. There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect. The need to distinguish between remedy and substance is supported by the Fourteenth Amendment's history and this Court's case law, see,  e.  g.,  Civil Rights Cases,  109 U. S. 3 , 13-14, 15;  Oregon  v.  Mitchell,  400 U. S. 112 , 209, 296. The Amendment's design has proved significant also in maintaining the traditional separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary, depriving Congress of any power to interpret and elaborate on its meaning by conferring self-executing substantive rights against the States, cf. id., at 325, and thereby leaving the interpretive power with the Judiciary. Pp. 516-529. (c) RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress' § 5 enforcement power because it contradicts vital principles necessary to maintain separation of powers and the federal-state balance. An instructive comparison may be drawn between RFRA and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, provisions of which were upheld in  Katzenbach, supra,  and subsequent voting rights cases. In contrast to the record of widespread and persisting racial discrimination which confronted Congress and the Judiciary in those cases, RFRA's legislative record lacks examples of any instances of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry in the past 40 years. Rather, the emphasis of the RFRA hearings was on laws like the one at issue that place incidental burdens on religion. It is difficult to maintain that such laws are based on animus or hostility to the burdened religious practices or that they indicate some widespread 509 pattern of religious discrimination in this country. RFRA's most serious shortcoming, however, lies in the fact that it is so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior. It appears, instead, to attempt a substantive change in constitutional protections, proscribing state conduct that the Fourteenth Amendment itself does not prohibit. Its sweeping coverage ensures its intrusion at every level of government, displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter. Its restrictions apply to every government agency and official, § 2000bb2(1), and to all statutory or other law, whether adopted before or after its enactment, § 2000bb-3(a). It has no termination date or termination mechanism. Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual who claims a substantial burden on his or her free exercise of religion. Such a claim will often be difficult to contest. See  Smith, supra,  at 887. Requiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law. 494 U. S., at 888. Furthermore, the least restrictive means requirement was not used in the  pre-Smith  jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify. All told, RFRA is a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens, and is not designed to identify and counteract state laws likely to be unconstitutional because of their treatment of religion.

AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION ET AL. APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA 
No. 96-511. Argued March 19, 1997-Decided June 26, 1997 Two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA or Act) seek to protect minors from harmful material on the Internet, an international network of interconnected computers that enables millions of people to communicate with one another in ""cyberspace"" and to access vast amounts of information from around the world. Title 47 U. S. C. § 223(a)(I)(B)(ii) (1994 ed., Supp. II) criminalizes the ""knowing"" transmission of ""obscene or indecent"" messages to any recipient under 18 years of age. Section 223(d) prohibits the ""knowin[g]"" sending or displaying to a person under 18 of any message ""that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.""  M firmative defenses are provided for those who take ""good faith, ... effective ... actions"" to restrict access by minors to the prohibited communications, § 223(e)(5)(A), and those who restrict such access by requiring certain designated forms of age proof, such as a verified credit card or an adult identification number, §223(e)(5)(B). A number of plaintiffs filed suit challenging the constitutionality of §§ 223(a)(I) and 223(d). After making extensive findings of fact, a three-judge District Court convened pursuant to the Act entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of both challenged provisions. The court's judgment enjoins the Government from enforcing § 223(a)(I)(B)'s prohibitions insofar as they relate to ""indecent"" communications, but expressly preserves the Government's right to investigate and prosecute the obscenity or child pornography activities prohibited therein. The injunction against enforcement of § 223(d) is unqualified because that section contains no separate reference to obscenity or child pornography. The Government appealed to this Court under the Act's special review provisions, arguing that the District Court erred in holding that the CDA violated both the First Amendment because it is overbroad and the Fifth Amendment because it is vague. Held:  The CDA's ""indecent transmission"" and ""patently offensive display"" provisions abridge ""the freedom of speech"" protected by the First Amendment. Pp. 864-885. 845 (a) Although the CDA's vagueness is relevant to the First Amendment overbreadth inquiry, the judgment should be affirmed without reaching the Fifth Amendment issue. P. 864. (b) A close look at the precedents relied on by the Government Ginsberg  v.  New York,  390 U. S. 629 ;  FCC  v.  Pacifica Foundation, 438  U. S. 726; and  Renton  v.  Playtime Theatres, Inc.,  475 U. S. 41 -raises, rather than relieves, doubts about the CDA's constitutionality. The CDA differs from the various laws and orders upheld in those cases in many ways, including that it does not allow parents to consent to their children's use of restricted materials; is not limited to commercial transactions; fails to provide any definition of ""indecent"" and omits any requirement that ""patently offensive"" material lack socially redeeming value; neither limits its broad categorical prohibitions to particular times nor bases them on an evaluation by an agency familiar with the medium's unique characteristics; is punitive; applies to a medium that, unlike radio, receives full First Amendment protection; and cannot be properly analyzed as a form of time, place, and manner regulation because it is a content-based blanket restriction on speech. These precedents, then, do not require the Court to uphold the CDA and are fully consistent with the application of the most stringent review of its provisions. Pp. 864-868. (c) The special factors recognized in some of the Court's cases as justifying regulation of the broadcast media-the history of extensive Government regulation of broadcasting, see,  e. g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co.  v.  FCC,  395 U. S. 367 , 399-400; the scarcity of available frequencies at its inception, see,  e. g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.  v.  FCC, 512  U. S. 622, 637-638; and its ""invasive"" nature, see  Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.  v.  FCC,  492 U. S. 115 , 128-are not present in cyberspace. Thus, these cases provide no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to the Internet. Pp.868-870. (d) Regardless of whether the CDA is so vague that it violates the Fifth Amendment, the many ambiguities concerning the scope of its coverage render it problematic for First Amendment purposes. For instance, its use of the undefined terms ""indecent"" and ""patently offensive"" will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other and just what they mean. The vagueness of such a content-based regulation, see,  e. g., Gentile  v.  State Bar of Nev.,  501 U. S. 1030 , coupled with its increased deterrent effect as a criminal statute, see,  e. g., Dombrowski  v.  Pfister,  380 U. S. 479 , raise special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech. Contrary to the Government's argument, the CDA is not saved from vagueness by the fact that its ""patently offensive"" stand- 846 ard repeats the second part of the three-prong obscenity test set forth in  Miller  v.  California,  413 U. S. 15 ,24. The second  Miller  prong reduces the inherent vagueness of its own ""patently offensive"" term by requiring that the proscribed material be ""specifically defined by the applicable state law."" In addition, the  Miller  definition applies only to ""sexual conduct,"" whereas the CDA prohibition extends also to ""excretory activities"" and ""organs"" of both a sexual and excretory nature. Each of  Miller's  other two prongs also critically limits the uncertain sweep of the obscenity definition. Just because a definition including three limitations is not vague, it does not follow that one of those limitations, standing alone, is not vague. The CDA's vagueness undermines the likelihood that it has been carefully tailored to the congressional goal of protecting minors from potentially harmful materials. Pp.870-874. (e) The CDA lacks the precision that the First Amendment requires when a statute regulates the content of speech. Although the Government has an interest in protecting children from potentially harmful materials, see,  e. g., Ginsberg,  390 U. S., at 639, the CDA pursues that interest by suppressing a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to send and receive, see,  e. g., Sable,  492 U. S., at 126. Its breadth is wholly unprecedented. The CDA's burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the Act's legitimate purposes. See,  e.  g., id., at 126. The Government has not proved otherwise. On the other hand, the District Court found that currently available  user-based  software suggests that a reasonably effective method by which  parents  can prevent their children from accessing material which the  parents  believe is inappropriate will soon be widely available. Moreover, the arguments in this Court referred to possible alternatives such as requiring that indecent material be ""tagged"" to facilitate parental control, making exceptions for messages with artistic or educational value, providing some tolerance for parental choice, and regulating some portions of the Internet differently from others. Particularly in the light of the absence of any detailed congressional findings, or even hearings addressing the CDA's special problems, the Court is persuaded that the CDA is not narrowly tailored. Pp.874-879. (f) The Government's three additional arguments for sustaining the CDA's affirmative prohibitions are rejected. First, the contention that the Act is constitutional because it leaves open ample ""alternative channels"" of communication is unpersuasive because the CDA regulates speech on the basis of its content, so that a ""time, place, and manner"" analysis is inapplicable. See,  e. g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N.  Y. v. 847 Public Servo  Comm'n of N. Y.,  447 U. S. 530 , 536. Second, the assertion that the CDA's ""knowledge"" and ""specific person"" requirements significantly restrict its permissible application to communications to persons the sender knows to be under 18 is untenable, given that most Internet forums are open to all comers and that even the strongest reading of the ""specific person"" requirement would confer broad powers of censorship, in the form of a ""heckler's veto,"" upon any opponent of indecent speech. Finally, there is no textual support for the submission that material having scientific, educational, or other redeeming social value will necessarily fall outside the CDA's prohibitions. Pp. 879-881. (g) The § 223(e)(5) defenses do not constitute the sort of ""narrow tailoring"" that would save the CDA. The Government's argument that transmitters may take protective ""good faith actio[n]"" by ""tagging"" their indecent communications in a way that would indicate their contents, thus permitting recipients to block their reception with appropriate software, is illusory, given the requirement that such action be ""effective"": The proposed screening software does not currently exist, but, even if it did, there would be no way of knowing whether a potential recipient would actually block the encoded material. The Government also failed to prove that § 223(b)(5)'s verification defense would significantly reduce the CDA's heavy burden on adult speech. Although such verification is actually being used by some commercial providers of sexually explicit material, the District Court's findings indicate that it is not economically feasible for most noncommercial speakers. Pp.881-882. (h) The Government's argument that this Court should preserve the CDA's constitutionality by honoring its severability clause, § 608, and by construing nonseverable terms narrowly, is acceptable in only one respect. Because obscene speech may be banned totally, see  Miller, 413  U. S., at 18, and § 223(a)'s restriction of ""obscene"" material enjoys a textual manifestation separate from that for ""indecent"" material, the Court can sever the term ""or indecent"" from the statute, leaving the rest of § 223(a) standing. Pp. 882-885. (i) The Government's argument that its ""significant"" interest in fostering the Internet's growth provides an independent basis for upholding the CDA's constitutionality is singularly unpersuasive. The dramatic expansion of this new forum contradicts the factual basis underlying this contention: that the unregulated availability of ""indecent"" and ""patently offensive"" material is driving people away from the Internet.

FORBES CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT 
No. 96-779. Argued October 8, 1997-Decided May 18, 1998 Petitioner Arkansas Educational Television Commission (AETC), a stateowned public television broadcaster, sponsored a debate between the major party candidates for the 1992 election in Arkansas' Third Congressional District. When AETC denied the request of respondent Forbes, an independent candidate with little popular support, for permission to participate in the debate, Forbes filed this suit, claiming,  inter alia,  that he was entitled to participate under the First Amendment. The jury made express findings that Forbes' exclusion had not been influenced by political pressure or disagreement with his views. The District Court entered judgment for AETC. The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the debate was a public forum to which all ballotqualified candidates had a presumptive right of access. Applying strict scrutiny, the court determined that AETC's assessment of Forbes' ""political viability"" was neither a compelling nor a narrowly tailored reason for excluding him. Held:  AETC's exclusion of Forbes from the debate was consistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 672-683. (a) Unlike most other public television programs, candidate debates are subject to scrutiny under this Court's public forum doctrine. Having first arisen in the context of streets and parks, the doctrine should not be extended in a mechanical way to the different context of television broadcasting. Broad rights of access for outside speakers would be antithetical, as a general rule, to the editorial discretion that broadcasters must exercise to fulfill their journalistic purpose and statutory obligations. For two reasons, however, candidate debates present the narrow exception to the rule. First, unlike AETC's other broadcasts, the debate was by design a forum for candidates' political speech. Consistent with the long tradition of such debates, AETC's implicit representation was that the views expressed were those of the candidates, not its own. The debate's very purpose was to allow the expression of those views with minimal intrusion by the broadcaster. Second, candidate debates are of exceptional significance in the electoral process. Deliberation on candidates' positions and qualifications is integral to our system of government, and electoral speech may have its most pro- 667 found and widespread impact when it is disseminated through televised debates. Thus, the special characteristics of candidate debates support the conclusion that the AETC debate was a forum of some type. The question of what type must be answered by reference to this Court's public forum precedents. Pp. 672-676. (b) For the Court's purposes, it will suffice to employ the categories of speech fora already established in the case law. The Court has identified three types of fora: the traditional public forum, the public forum created by government designation, and the nonpublic forum.  Cornelius  v.  NAACP Legal Defense  &  Ed. Fund, Inc.,  473 U. S. 788 , 802. Traditional public fora are defined by the objective characteristics of the property, such as whether, ""by long tradition or by government fiat,"" the property has been ""devoted to assembly and debate.""  Perry Ed. Assn.  v.  Perry Local Educators' Assn.,  460 U. S. 37 , 45. The government can exclude a speaker from a traditional public forum only when the exclusion is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.  Cornelius, supra,  at 800. Designated public fora are created by purposeful governmental action opening a nontraditional public forum for expressive use by the general public or by a particular class of speakers.  E. g., International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc.  v.  Lee,  505 U. S. 672 , 678  (ISKCON).  If the government excludes a speaker who falls within the class to which such a forum is made generally available, its action is subject to strict scrutiny.  E. g., Cornelius, supra,  at 802. Property that is not a traditional public forum or a designated public forum is either a nonpublic forum or not a forum at all.  ISKCON, supra,  at 678-679. Access to a nonpublic forum can be restricted if the restrictions are reasonable and are not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's views.  Cornelius, supra,  at 800. Pp. 677-678. (c) The AETC debate was a nonpublic forum. The parties agree that it was not a traditional public forum, and it was not a designated public forum under this Court's precedents. Those cases demonstrate,  inter alia,  that the government does not create a designated public forum when it does no more than reserve eligibility for access to a forum to a particular class of speakers, whose members must then, as individuals, ""obtain permission,""  Cornelius,  473 U. S., at 804, to use it. Contrary to the Eighth Circuit's assertion, AETC did not make its debate generally available to candidates for the congressional seat at issue. Instead, it reserved eligibility for participation to candidates for that seat (as opposed to some other seat), and then made candidate-bycandidate determinations as to which of the eligible candidates would participate in the debate. Such ""selective access,"" unsupported by evidence of a purposeful designation for public use, does not create a public 668 forum, but indicates that the debate was a nonpublic forum.  Id.,  at 805. Pp. 678-682. (d) AETC's decision to exclude Forbes was a reasonable, viewpointneutral exercise of journalistic discretion consistent with the First Amendment. The record demonstrates beyond dispute that Forbes was excluded not because of his viewpoint, but because he had not generated appreciable public interest. There is no serious argument that AETC did not act in good faith in this case. Pp.682-683. 93 F.3d 497 , reversed. KENNEDY, J., delivered the OpInIOn of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C.

FINLEY ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT 
No.97-371. Argued March 31, 1998-Decided June 25,1998 The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 vests the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) with substantial discretion to award financial grants to support the arts; it identifies only the broadest funding priorities, including ""artistic and cultural significance, giving emphasis to ... creativity and cultural diversity,"" ""professional excellence,"" and the encouragement of ""public ... education ... and appreciation of the arts."" See 20 U. S. C. §§ 954(c)(1)-(10). Applications for NEA funding are initially reviewed by advisory panels of experts in the relevant artistic field. The panels report to the National Council on the Arts (Council), which, in turn, advises the NEA Chairperson. In 1989, controversial photographs that appeared in two NEA-funded exhibits prompted public outcry over the agency's grant-making procedures. Congress reacted to the controversy by inserting an amendment into the NEA's 1990 reauthorization bill. The amendment became § 954(d)(1), which directs the Chairperson to ensure that ""artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which [grant] applications are judged, taking into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public."" The NEA has not promulgated an official interpretation of the provision, but the Council adopted a resolution to implement § 954(d)(1) by ensuring that advisory panel members represent geographic, ethnic, and esthetic diversity. The four individual respondents are performance artists who applied for NEA grants before § 954(d)(1) was enacted. An advisory panel recommended approval of each of their projects, but the Council subsequently recommended disapproval, and funding was denied. They filed suit for restoration of the recommended grants or reconsideration of their applications, asserting First Amendment and statutory claims. When Congress enacted § 954(d)(1), respondents, now joined by the N ational Association of Artists' Organizations, amended their complaint to challenge the provision as void for vagueness and impermissibly viewpoint based. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents on their facial constitutional challenge to § 954(d)(1). 570 The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that § 954(d)(1), on its face, impermissibly discriminates on the basis of viewpoint and is void for vagueness under the First and Fifth Amendments. Held:  Section 954(d)(1) is facially valid, as it neither inherently interferes with First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness principles. pp. 580-590. (a) Respondents confront a heavy burden in advancing their facial constitutional challenge, and they have not demonstrated a substantial risk that application of § 954(d)(1) will lead to the suppression of free expression, see  Broadrick  v.  Oklahoma,  413 U. S. 601 , 615. The premise of respondents' claim is that § 954(d)(1) constrains the agency's ability to fund certain categories of artistic expression. The provision, however, simply adds ""considerations"" to the grant-making process; it does not preclude awards to projects that might be deemed ""indecent"" or ""disrespectful,"" nor place conditions on grants, or even specify that those factors must be given any particular weight in reviewing an application. Regardless of whether the NEA's view that the formulation of diverse advisory panels is sufficient to comply with Congress' command is in fact a reasonable reading, § 954(d)(1)'s plain text clearly does not impose a categorical requirement. Furthermore, the political context surrounding the ""decency and respect"" clause's adoption is inconsistent with respondents' assertion. The legislation was a bipartisan proposal introduced as a counterweight to amendments that would have eliminated the NEA's funding or substantially constrained its grant-making authority. Section 954(d)(1) merely admonishes the NEA to take ""decency and respect"" into consideration, and the Court does not perceive a realistic danger that it will be utilized to preclude or punish the expression of particular views. The Court typically strikes down legislation as facially unconstitutional when the dangers are both more evident and more substantial. See,  e.  g.,  R. A. V.  v.  St. Paul,  505 U. S. 377 . Given the varied interpretations of the ""decency and respect"" criteria urged by the parties, and the provision's vague exhortation to ""take them into consideration,"" it seems unlikely that § 954(d)(1) will significantly compromise First Amendment values. The NEA's enabling statute contemplates a number of indisputably constitutional applications for both the ""decency"" and the ""respect"" prongs of § 954(d)(1). It is well established that ""decency"" is a permissible factor where ""educational suitability"" motivates its consideration. See,  e.  g.,  Board of Ed., Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No.  26 v.  Pico,  457 U. S. 853 , 871. And the statute already provides that the agency must take ""cultural diversity"" into account. References to permissible applications would not alone be sufficient to sustain the statute, 571 but neither is the Court persuaded that, in other applications, the language of § 954(d)(1) itself will give rise to the suppression of protected expression. Any content-based considerations that may be taken into account are a consequence of the nature of arts funding; the NEA has limited resources to allocate among many ""artistically excellent"" projects, and it does so on the basis of a wide variety of subjective criteria. Respondent's reliance on  Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,  515 U. S. 819 , 837-in which the Court overturned a public university's objective decision denying funding to all student publications having religious editorial viewpoints-is therefore misplaced. The NEA's mandate is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently content-based ""excellence"" threshold for NEA support sets it apart from the subsidy at issue in  Rosenberger.  Moreover, although the First Amendment applies in the subsidy context, Congress has wide latitude to set spending priorities. See,  e. g., Regan  v.  Taxation with Representation of Wash.,  461 U. S. 540 , 549. Unless § 954(d)(1) is applied in a manner that raises concern about the suppression of disfavored viewpoints, the Court will uphold it. Pp. 580-588. (b) The lower courts also erred in invalidating § 954(d)(1) as unconstitutionally vague. The First and Fifth Amendments protect speakers from arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of vague standards. See  NAACP  v.  Button,  371 U. S. 415 , 432-433. Section 954(d)(1)'s terms are undeniably opaque, and if they appeared in a criminal statute or regulatory scheme, they could raise substantial vagueness concerns. It is unlikely, however, that speakers will be compelled to steer too far clear of any forbidden area in the context of NEA grants. As a practical matter, artists may conform their speech to what they believe to be the NEA decisionmaking criteria in order to acquire funding. But when the Government is acting as patron rather than sovereign, the consequences of imprecision are not constitutionally severe. In the context of selective subsidies, it is not always feasible for Congress to legislate with clarity. Indeed, to accept respondents' vagueness argument would be to call into question the constitutionality of the many valuable Government programs awarding scholarships and grants on the basis of subjective criteria such as ""excellence."" pp. 588-590. 100 F.3d 671 , reversed and remanded.

AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOUNDATION, INC., ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT No. 97-930. Argued October 14, 1998-Decided January 12, 1999 Colorado allows its citizens to make laws directly through initiatives placed on election ballots. The complaint in this federal action challenged six of the State's many controls on the initiative-petition process. Plaintiffs-respondents, the American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., and several individuals (collectively, ACLF), charged that the following prescriptions of Colorado's law governing initiative petitions violate the First Amendment's freedom of speech guarantee: (1) the requirement that petition circulators be at least 18 years old, Colo. Rev. Stat. § 1-40-112(1); (2) the further requirement that they be registered voters, ibid.; (3) the limitation of the petition circulation period to six months, § 1-40-108; (4) the requirement that petition circulators wear identification badges stating their names, their status as ""VOLUNTEER"" or ""PAID,"" and if the latter, the name and telephone number of their employer, § 1-40-112(2); (5) the requirement that circulators attach to each petition section an affidavit containing,  inter alia,  the circulator's name and address, § 1-40-111(2); and (6) the requirements that initiative proponents disclose (a) at the time they file their petition, the name, address, and county of voter registration of all paid circulators, the amount of money proponents paid per petition signature, and the total amount paid to each circulator, and (b) on a monthly basis, the names of the proponents, the name and address of each paid circulator, the name of the proposed ballot measure, and the amount of money paid and owed to each circulator during the month, § 1-40-121. The District Court struck down the badge requirement and portions of the disclosure requirements, but upheld the age, affidavit, and registration requirements, and the six-month limit on petition circulation. The Tenth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. That court properly sought guidance from this Court's recent decisions on ballot access, see,  e.  g.,  Timmons  v.  Twin Cities Area New Party,  520 U. S. 351 , and on handbill distribution, see,  e.  g.,  McIntyre  v.  Ohio Elections Comm'n,  514 U. S. 334 . The Tenth Circuit upheld, as reasonable regulations of the ballotinitiative process, the age restriction, the six-month limit on petition circulation, and the affidavit requirement. The court struck down the 183 requirement that petition circulators be registered voters, and also held portions of the badge and disclosure requirements invalid as trenching unnecessarily and improperly on political expression. This Court agreed to review the Court of Appeals dispositions concerning the registration, badge, and disclosure requirements. See 522 U. S. 1107. Precedent guides this review. In  Meyer  v.  Grant,  486 U. S. 414 , this Court struck down Colorado's prohibition of payment for the circulation of ballot-initiative petitions, concluding that petition circulation is ""core political speech"" for which First Amendment protection is ""at its zenith.""  Id.,  at 422, 425. This Court has also recognized, however, that ""there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order ... is to accompany the democratic processes.""  Storer  v.  Brown,  415 U. S. 724 , 730; see  Timmons,  520 U. S., at 358;  Anderson  v.  Celebrezze,  460 U. S. 780 , 788. Held:  The Tenth Circuit correctly separated necessary or proper ballotaccess controls from restrictions that unjustifiably inhibit the circulation of ballot-initiative petitions. Pp. 191-205. (a) States have considerable leeway to protect the integrity and reliability of the ballot-initiative process, as they have with respect to election processes generally. ""[N]o litmus-paper test"" will separate valid ballot-access provisions from invalid interactive speech restrictions, and this Court has come upon ""no substitute for the hard judgments that must be made.""  Storer,  415 U. S., at 730. But the First Amendment requires vigilance in making those judgments, to guard against undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas. See  Meyer,  486 U. S., at 421. The Court is satisfied that, as in  Meyer,  the restrictions in question significantly inhibit communication with voters about proposed political change, and are not warranted by the state interests (administrative efficiency, fraud detection, informing voters) alleged to justify those restrictions. This judgment is informed by other means Colorado employs to accomplish its regulatory purposes. Pp. 191-192. (b) Beyond question, Colorado's registration requirement drastically reduces the number of persons, both volunteer and paid, available to circulate petitions. That requirement produces a speech diminution of the very kind produced by the ban on paid circulators at issue in  Meyer.  Both provisions ""limi[t] the number of voices who will convey [the initiative proponents'] message"" and, consequently, cut down ""the size of the audience [proponents] can reach.""  Meyer,  486 U. S., at 422, 423. The ease with which qualified voters may register to vote does not lift the burden on speech at petition circulation time. There are individuals for whom, as the trial record shows, the choice not to register 184 
Syllabus implicates political thought and expression. The State's strong interest in policing lawbreakers among petition circulators by ensuring that circulators will be amenable to the Secretary of State's subpoena power is served by the requirement, upheld below, that each circulator submit an affidavit setting out, among several particulars, his or her address. ACLF did not challenge Colorado's right to require that all circulators be residents, a requirement that more precisely achieves the State's subpoena service objective. Assuming that a residence requirement would be upheld as a needful integrity-policing measure-a question that this Court, like the Tenth Circuit, has no occasion to decide because the parties have not placed the matter of residence at issue-the added registration requirement is not warranted. Pp. 192-197. (c) The Tenth Circuit held the badge requirement invalid insofar as it requires circulators to display their names. The District Court found from evidence ACLF presented that compelling circulators to wear identification badges inhibits participation in the petitioning process. Colorado's interest in enabling the public to identify, and the State to apprehend, petition circulators who engage in misconduct is addressed by the requirement that circulators disclose their names and addresses on affidavits submitted with each petition section. Unlike a name badge worn at the time a circulator is soliciting signatures, the affidavit is separated from the moment the circulator speaks, when reaction to the message is immediate and may be the most intense, emotional, and unreasoned. Because the badge requirement compels personal name identification at the precise moment when the circulator's interest in anonymity is greatest, it does not qualify for inclusion among ""the more limited [election process] identification requirement[s]"" to which this Court alluded in  McIntyre,  514 U. S., at 353. Like the Tenth Circuit, this Court expresses no opinion on the constitutionality of the additional requirements that the badge disclose whether the circulator is paid or volunteer, and if paid, by whom. Pp. 197-200. (d) The Tenth Circuit invalidated the requirement that ballotinitiative proponents file a final report when the initiative petition is submitted insofar as that requirement compels disclosure of each paid circulator by name and address, and the total amount paid to each circulator. That court also rejected compelled disclosure in monthly reports of the name and address of each paid circulator, and the amount of money paid and owed to each circulator during the month in question. In ruling on these disclosure requirements, the Court of Appeals looked primarily to this Court's decision in  Buckley  v.  Valeo,  424 U. S. 1 . In  Buckley,  the Court stated that ""exacting scrutiny"" is necessary when compelled disclosure of campaign-related payments is at issue, but nevertheless upheld, as substantially related to important governmental 185 interests, the reporting and disclosure provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Mindful of  Buckley,  the Tenth Circuit did not upset Colorado's disclosure requirements as a whole. Notably, the Court of Appeals upheld the State's requirements for disclosure of pay ors,  in particular, proponents' names and the total amount they have spent to collect signatures for their petitions. Disclosure of the names of initiative sponsors, and the amounts they have spent to gather support for their initiatives, responds to Colorado's substantial interest in controlling domination of the initiative process by affluent special interest groups. The added benefit of revealing the names of paid circulators and amounts paid to each circulator, the lower courts fairly determined from the record as a whole, has not been demonstrated. This Court expresses no opinion whether other monthly report prescriptions regarding which the Tenth Circuit identified no infirmity would, standing alone, survive review. Pp.201-204. (e) Through less problematic measures, Colorado can and does meet the State's substantial interest in regulating the ballot-initiative process. To deter fraud and diminish corruption, Colorado retains an arsenal of safeguards. To inform the public about the source of funding for ballot initiatives, the State legitimately requires sponsors of ballot initiatives to disclose who pays petition circulators, and how much. To ensure grass roots support, Colorado conditions placement of an initiative proposal on the ballot on the proponent's submission of valid signatures representing five percent of the total votes cast for all candidates for Secretary of State at the previous general election. Furthermore, in aid of efficiency, veracity, or clarity, Colorado has provided for an array of process measures not contested here by ACLF. Pp. 204-205. 120 F.3d 1092 , affirmed.

No. 98-387. Argued April 27, 1999-Decided June 14, 1999 Title 18 U. S. C. § 1304 and an implementing Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation prohibit,  inter alia,  radio and television broadcasters from carrying advertising about privately operated commercial casino gambling, regardless of the station's or casino's location. In  United States  v.  Edge Broadcasting Co.,  509 U. S. 418 , this Court upheld the constitutionality of § 1304 as applied to advertising of Virginia's lottery by a broadcaster in North Carolina, where no such lottery was authorized. Petitioners-representing New Orleans area broadcasters-wish to run advertisements for private commercial casinos that are lawful and regulated in Louisiana and Mississippi, and they filed this suit for a declaration that § 1304 and the FCC's regulation violate the First Amendment as applied to them. The District Court utilized the test for assessing commercial speech restrictions set out in  Central Hudson Gas  &  Elec. Corp.  v.  Public Servo Comm'n of N.  Y.,  447 U. S. 557 , 566, and granted the Government's cross-motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:  Section 1304 may not be applied to advertisements of lawful private casino gambling that are broadcast by petitioners' radio or television stations located in Louisiana, where such gambling is legal. Pp. 183-196. (a)  Central Hudson's  four-part test asks (1) whether the speech at issue concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial; and, if so, (3) whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted and (4) whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest. The four parts of the  Central Hudson  test are not entirely discrete; all are important and, to a certain extent, interrelated. While some advocate a more straightforward and stringent test,  Central Hudson,  as applied in the Court's more recent commercial speech cases, provides an adequate basis for decision in this case. Pp. 183-184. (b) All parties agree that petitioners' proposed broadcasts constitute commercial speech, and that they would satisfy the first part of the  Central Hudson  test: Their content is not misleading and concerns lawful activities, i.  e.,  private casino gambling in Louisiana and Mississippi. 174 
174 GREATER NEW ORLEANS BROADCASTING ASSN., INC.  v.  UNITED STATES 
Syllabus In addition, the interests asserted by the Government are ""substantial"": (1) reducing the social costs associated with casino and other forms of gambling and (2) assisting States that restrict or prohibit casino and other forms of gambling. However, that conclusion is by no means selfevident, since, in the judgment of both Congress and many state legislatures, the social costs that support the suppression of gambling are offset, and sometimes outweighed, by countervailing policy considerations. The Court cannot ignore Congress' unwillingness to adopt a single national policy that consistently endorses either interest asserted by the Government. See,  e. g., Edenfield  v.  Fane,  507 U. S. 761 , 768. Considering both the quality of the asserted interests and the information sought to be suppressed, the crosscurrents in the scope and application of § 1304 become more difficult to defend. Pp. 184-187. (c) As applied to petitioners' case, § 1304 cannot satisfy the third and fourth parts of the  Central Hudson  test. With regard to the Government's first asserted interest-alleviating casino gambling's social costs by limiting demand-the operation of § 1304 and its regulatory regime is so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies that the Government cannot hope to exonerate it. See  Rubin  v.  Coors Brewing Co.,  514 U. S. 476 , 488. For example, federal law prohibits a broadcaster from carrying advertising about privately operated commercial casino gambling regardless of the station's or casino's location, but exempts advertising about state-run casinos, certain occasional commercial casino gambling, and tribal casino gambling even if the broadcaster is located in, or broadcasts to, a jurisdiction with the strictest of antigambling policies. Coupled with the FCC's interpretation and enforcement of the statute, it appears that the Government is committed to prohibiting certain accurate product information, not commercial enticements of all kinds, and then only for certain brands of  casino  gambling. The most significant difference identified by the Government between tribal and other classes of casino gambling is that the former are heavily regulated; but Congress' failure to institute such direct regulation of private casino gambling undermines the asserted justifications for the speech restriction before the Court. There may be valid reasons for imposing commercial regulations on non-Indian businesses that differ from those imposed on tribal enterprises, but it does not follow that those differences justify abridging non-Indians' freedom of speech more severely than the freedom of their tribal competitors. For the power to prohibit or to regulate particular conduct does not necessarily include the power to prohibit or regulate speech about that conduct. To the extent that federal law distinguishes among information about tribal, governmental, and private casinos based on the identity of their owners or operators, the Government presents no sound reason why such 175 lines bear any meaningful relationship to the Government's asserted interest. Pp. 188-194. (d) Considering the manner in which § 1304 and its exceptions operate and the scope of the speech proscribed, the Government's second asserted interest-""assisting"" States with policies that disfavor private casinos-provides no more convincing basis for upholding the regulation than the first. Even assuming that the state policies on which the Federal Government seeks to embellish are more coherent and pressing than their federal counterpart, § 1304 sacrifices an intolerable amount of truthful speech about lawful conduct when compared to the diverse policies at stake and the social ills that one could reasonably hope such a ban to eliminate.

UNITED REPORTING PUBLISHING CORP. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT No. 98-678. Argued October 13, 1999-Decided December 7,1999 Respondent publishing company provides the names and addresses of recently arrested individuals to its customers, who include attorneys, insurance companies, drug and alcohol counselors, and driving schools. It received this information from petitioner and other California state and local law enforcement agencies until the State amended Cal. Govt. Code Ann. § 6254(f)(3) to require that a person requesting an arrestee's address declare that the request is being made for one of five prescribed purposes and that the address will not be used directly or indirectly to sell a product or service. Respondent sought declaratory and injunctive relief to hold the amendment unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Federal District Court ultimately granted respondent summary judgment, having construed respondent's claim as presenting a facial challenge to amended § 6254(f). In affirming, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the statute unconstitutionally restricts commercial speech. Held:  Respondent was not, under this Court's cases, entitled to prevail on a ""facial attack"" on § 6254(f)(3). The allowance of a First Amendment overbreadth challenge to a statute is an exception to the traditional rule that ""a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied may not challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the Court.""  New York  v.  Ferber,  458 U. S. 747 , 767. The overbreadth doctrine is strong medicine that should be employed only as a last resort. At least for the purposes of facial invalidation, petitioner is correct that § 6254(f)(3) is not an abridgment of anyone's right to engage in speech, but simply a law regulating access to information in the government's hands. This is not a case in which the government is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses. California law merely requires respondent to qualify under the statute if it wishes to obtain arrestees' addresses. California could decide not to give out arrestee information at all without violating the First Amendment. Cf.  Houchins  v.  KQED, Inc.,  438 U. S. 1 , 14. To the extent that respondent's ""facial challenge"" seeks to rely on the statute's effect on parties not before the court-respondent's potential customers, 33 for example-its claim does not fall within the case law allowing courts to entertain facial challenges. No threat of prosecution, see  Gooding  v.  Wilson,  405 U. S. 518 , 520-521, or cut off of funds, see  National Endowment for Arts  v.  Finley,  524 U. S. 569 , hangs over their heads.

SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PAC ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT No. 98-963. Argued October 5, 1999-Decided January 24, 2000 Respondents Shrink Missouri Government PAC, a political action committee, and Zev David Fredman, a candidate for the 1998 Republican nomination for Missouri state auditor, filed suit, alleging that a Missouri statute imposing limits ranging from $275 to $1,075 on contributions to candidates for state office violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Shrink Missouri gave Fredman $1,025 in 1997, and $50 in 1998, and represented that, without the statutory limitation, it would contribute more. Fredman alleged he could campaign effectively only with more generous contributions than the statute allowed. On crossmotions for summary judgment, the District Court sustained the statute. Applying  Buckley  v.  Valeo,  424 U. S. 1   (per curiam),  the court found adequate support for the law in the proposition that large contributions raise suspicions of influence peddling tending to undermine citizens' confidence in government integrity. The court rejected respondents' contention that inflation since  Buckley's  approval of a federal $1,000 restriction meant that the state limit of $1,075 for a statewide office could not be constitutional today. In reversing, the Eighth Circuit found that  Buckley  had articulated and applied a strict scrutiny standard of review, and held that Missouri had to demonstrate that it had a compelling interest and that the contribution limits at issue were narrowly drawn to serve that interest. Treating Missouri's claim of a compelling interest in avoiding the corruption or the perception of corruption caused by candidates' acceptance of large campaign contributions as insufficient by itself to satisfy strict scrutiny, the court required demonstrable evidence that genuine problems resulted from contributions in amounts greater than the statutory limits. It ruled that the State's evidence was inadequate for this purpose. Held: Buckley  is authority for comparable state limits on contributions to state political candidates, and those limits need not be pegged to the precise dollar amounts approved in  Buckley.  Pp. 385-398. (a) The  Buckley  Court held,  inter alia,  that a Federal Election Campaign Act provision placing a $1,000 annual ceiling on independent expenditures linked to specific candidates for federal office infringed speech and association guarantees of the First Amendment and the 378 Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth, but upheld other provisions limiting contributions by individuals to any single candidate to $1,000 per election. P. 385. (b) In addressing the speech claim, the  Buckley  Court explicitly rejected both intermediate scrutiny for communicative action, see  United States  v.  O'Brien,  391 U. S. 367 , and the similar standard applicable to merely time, place, and manner restrictions, see,  e.  g.,  Adderley  v.  Florida,  385 U. S. 39 , and instead referred generally to ""the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment,"" 424 U. S., at 16. The Court then drew a line between expenditures and contributions, treating expenditure restrictions as direct restraints on speech,  id.,  at 19, but saying, in effect, that limiting contributions left communication significantly unimpaired,  id.,  at 20-21. The Court flagged a similar difference between the impacts of expenditure and contribution limits on association rights,  id.,  at 22; see also  id.,  at 28, and later made that distinction explicit,  e.  g.,  Federal Election Comm'n  v.  Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,  479 U. S. 238 , 259-260. Thus, under  Buckley's  standard of scrutiny, a contribution limit involving significant interference with associational rights could survive if the Government demonstrated that regulating contributions was a means ""closely drawn"" to match a ""sufficiently important interest,"" 424 U. S., at 25, though the dollar amount of the limit need not be ""fine tun[ed],""  id.,  at 30. While  Buckley  did not attempt to parse distinctions between the speech and associational standards of scrutiny for contribution limits, the Court made clear that such restrictions bore more heavily on associational rights than on speech rights, and thus proceeded on the understanding that a contribution limitation surviving a claim of associational abridgment would survive a speech challenge as well. The Court found the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption to be a constitutionally sufficient justification for the contribution limits at issue.  Id.,  at 25-28. Pp. 386-389. (c) In defending its statute, Missouri espouses those same interests of preventing corruption and the appearance of it. Even without  Buckley,  there would be no serious question about the legitimacy of these interests, which underlie bribery and antigratuity statutes. Rather, respondents take the State to task for failing to justify the invocation of those interests with empirical evidence of actually corrupt practices or of a perception among Missouri voters that unrestricted contributions must have been exerting a covertly corrosive influence. The state statute is not void, however, for want of evidence. The quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised.  Buckley  demonstrates that the dangers of large, 379 corrupt contributions and the suspicion that large contributions are corrupt are neither novel nor implausible. See 424 U. S., at 27, and n. 28. Respondents are wrong in arguing that this Court has ""supplemented"" its  Buckley  holding with a new requirement that governments enacting contribution limits must demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, a contention for which respondents rely principally on  Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.  v.  Federal Election Comm'n,  518 U. S. 604 . This Court has never accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden, and  Colorado Republican  deals not with a government's burden to justify contribution limits, but with limits on independent expenditures by political parties, which the principal opinion expressly distinguished from contribution limits.  Id.,  at 615-618. In any event, this case does not present a close call requiring further definition of whatever the State's evidentiary obligation may be. Although the record does not show that the Missouri Legislature relied on the evidence and findings accepted in  Buckley,  the evidence introduced by petitioners or cited by the lower courts in this action and a prior case involving a related ballot initiative is enough to show that the substantiation of the congressional concerns reflected in  Buckley  has its counterpart in support of the Missouri law. Moreover, although majority votes do not, as such, defeat First Amendment protections, the statewide vote adopting the initiative attested to the public perception that contribution limits are necessary to combat corruption and the appearance thereof. A more extensive evidentiary documentation might be necessary if respondents had made any showing of their own to cast doubt on the apparent implications of  Buckley's  evidence and the record here. However, the nearest they come to challenging these conclusions is their invocation of academic studies that are contradicted by other studies. Pp. 390-395. (d) There is no support for respondents' various arguments that the Missouri limitations are so different in kind from those sustained in  Buckley  as to raise essentially a new issue about the adequacy of the Missouri statute's tailoring to serve its purposes. Here, as in  Buckley, supra,  at 21, there is no indication that those limits have had any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns and political associations, and thus there is no showing that the limitations prevented candidates from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy. Indeed, the District Court found that since the Missouri limits became effective, candidates for state office have been able to raise funds sufficient to run effective campaigns, and that candidates are still able to amass impressive campaign war chests. The plausibility of these conclusions is buttressed by petitioners' evidence that in the last election before the contributions became effective, 97.62 percent of all contribu- 380 tors to candidates for state auditor made contributions of $2,000 or less. Even assuming that the contribution limits affected respondent Fredman's ability to wage a competitive campaign, a showing of one affected individual does not point up a system of suppressed political advocacy that would be unconstitutional under  Buckley.  The District Court's conclusions and the supporting evidence also suffice to answer respondents' variant claim that the Missouri limits today differ in kind from  Buckley's  owing to inflation since that case was decided. Respondents' assumption that  Buckley  set a minimum constitutional threshold for contribution limits, which in dollars adjusted for loss of purchasing power are now well above the lines drawn by Missouri, is a fundamental misunderstanding of that case. The Court there specifically rejected the contention that $1,000, or any other amount, was a constitutional minimum, and instead asked whether the contribution limitation was so low as to impede the ability of candidates to amass the resources necessary for effective advocacy. 424 U. S., at 21. Such being the test, the issue in subsequent cases cannot be truncated to a narrow question about the power of the dollar. Pp. 395-397. 161 F.3d 519 , reversed and remanded.

SOUTHWORTH ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT No. 98-1189. Argued November 9, 1999-Decided March 22, 2000 Petitioner, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System (hereinafter University), requires students at the University's Madison campus to pay a segregated activity fee. The fee supports various campus services and extracurricular student activities. In the University's view, such fees enhance students' educational experience by promoting extracurricular activities, stimulating advocacy and debate on diverse points of view, enabling participation in campus administrative activity, and providing opportunities to develop social skills, all consistent with the University's broad educational mission. Registered student organizations (RSO's) engaging in a number of diverse expressive activities are eligible to receive a portion of the fees, which are administered by the student government subject to the University's approval. The parties have stipulated that the process for reviewing and approving RSO applications for funding is administered in a viewpoint-neutral fashion. RSO's may also obtain funding through a student referendum. Respondents, present and former Madison campus students, filed suit against the University, alleging,  inter alia,  that the fee violates their First Amendment rights, and that the University must grant them the choice not to fund RSO's that engage in political and ideological expression offensive to their personal beliefs. In granting respondents summary judgment, the Federal District Court declared the fee program invalid under  Abood  v.  Detroit Bd. of Ed.,  431 U. S. 209 , and  Keller  v.  State Bar of Gal.,  496 U. S. 1 , and enjoined the University from using the fees to fund any RSO engaging in political or ideological speech. Agreeing with the District Court that this Court's compelled speech precedents control, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the program was not germane to the University's mission, did not further a vital University policy, and imposed too great a burden on respondents' free speech rights. It added that protecting those rights was of heightened concern following  Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,  515 U. S. 819 , because if the University could not discriminate in distributing the funds, students could not be compelled to fund organizations engaging in political and ideological speech. It extended the District Court's order and enjoined the University from requiring students to pay that 218 Syllabus portion of the fee used to fund RSO's engaged in political or ideological expression. Held: 1. The First Amendment permits a public university to charge its students an activity fee used to fund a program to facilitate extracurricular student speech, provided that the program is viewpoint neutral. The University exacts the fee at issue for the sole purpose of facilitating the free and open exchange of ideas by, and among, its students. Objecting students, however, may insist upon certain safeguards with respect to the expressive activities they are required to support. The Court's public forum cases are instructive here by close analogy. Because the complaining students must pay fees to subsidize speech they find objectionable, even offensive, the rights acknowledged in  Abood  and  Keller  are implicated. In those cases, this Court held that a required service fee paid by nonunion employees to a union,  Abood, supra,  at 213, and fees paid by lawyers who were required to join a state bar association,  Keller, supra,  at 13-14, could be used to fund speech germane to those organizations' purposes but not to fund the organizations' own political expression. While these precedents identify the protesting students' interests, their germane speech standard is unworkable in the context of student speech at a university and gives insufficient protection both to the objecting students and to the University program itself. Even in the union context, this Court has encountered difficulties in deciding what is germane and what is not. The standard becomes all the more unmanageable in the public university setting, particularly where, as here, the State undertakes to stimulate the whole universe of speech and ideas. To insist upon asking what speech is germane would be contrary to the very goal the University seeks to pursue. The vast extent of permitted expression also underscores the high potential for intrusion on the objecting students' First Amendment rights, for it is all but inevitable that the fees will subsidize speech that some students find objectionable or offensive. A university is free to protect those rights by allowing an optional or refund system, but such a system is not a constitutional requirement. If a university determines that its mission is well served if students have the means to engage in dynamic discussion on a broad range of issues, it may impose a mandatory fee to sustain such dialogue. It must provide some protection to its students' First Amendment interests, however. The proper measure, and the principal standard of protection for objecting students, is the requirement of viewpoint neutrality in the allocation of funding support. This obligation was given substance in  Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., supra,  which concerned a student's right to use an extracurricular speech program already in place. The instant case considers the antecedent question whether a public university may require stu- 219 dents to pay a fee which creates the mechanism for the extracurricular speech in the first instance. The University may sustain the extracurricular dimensions of its programs by using mandatory student fees with viewpoint neutrality as the operational principle. There is symmetry then in the holding here and in  Rosenberger.  Pp. 229-234. 2. Because the parties have stipulated that the University's program respects the principle of viewpoint neutrality, the program in its basic structure must be found consistent with the First Amendment. This decision makes no distinction between campus and off-campus activities; and it ought not be taken to imply that when the University, its agents, employees, or faculty speak, they are subject to the First Amendment analysis which controls in this case. Pp. 234-235. 3. While not well developed on the present record, the referendum aspect of the University's program appears to permit RSO funding or defunding by majority vote of the student body. To the extent the referendum substitutes majority determinations for viewpoint neutrality it would undermine the constitutional protection the program requires.

Argued November 10, 1999-Decided March 29, 2000 Erie, Pennsylvania, enacted an ordinance making it a summary offense to knowingly or intentionally appear in public in a ""state of nudity."" Respondent Pap's A. M. (hereinafter Pap's), a Pennsylvania corporation, operated ""Kandyland,"" an Erie establishment featuring totally nude erotic dancing by women. To comply with the ordinance, these dancers had to wear, at a minimum, ""pasties"" and a ""G-string."" Pap's filed suit against Erie and city officials, seeking declaratory relief and a permanent injunction against the ordinance's enforcement. The Court of Common Pleas struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional, but the Commonwealth Court reversed. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in turn reversed, finding that the ordinance's public nudity sections violated Pap's right to freedom of expression as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Pennsylvania court held that nude dancing is expressive conduct entitled to some quantum of protection under the First Amendment, a view that the court noted was endorsed by eight Members of this Court in  Barnes  v.  Glen Theatre, Inc., 501  U. S. 560. The Pennsylvania court explained that, although one stated purpose of the ordinance was to combat negative secondary effects, there was also an unmentioned purpose to ""impact negatively on the erotic message of the dance."" Accordingly, the Pennsylvania court concluded that the ordinance was related to the suppression of expression. Because the ordinance was not content neutral, it was subject to strict scrutiny. The court held that the ordinance failed the narrow tailoring requirement of strict scrutiny. After this Court granted certiorari, Pap's filed a motion to dismiss the case as moot, noting that Kandyland no longer operated as a nude dancing club, and that Pap's did not operate such a club at any other location. This Court denied the motion. Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 553 Pa. 348, 719 A. 2d 273, reversed and remanded."

PLAYBOY ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, INC. APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE No. 98-1682. Argued November 30, 1999-Decided May 22, 2000 Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires cable television operators providing channels ""primarily dedicated to sexuallyoriented programming"" either to ""fully scramble or otherwise fully block"" those channels or to limit their transmission to hours when children are unlikely to be viewing, set by administrative regulation as between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. Even before § 505's enactment, cable operators used signal scrambling to limit access to certain programs to paying customers. Scrambling could be imprecise, however; and either or both audio and visual portions of the scrambled programs might be heard or seen, a phenomenon known as ""signal bleed."" The purpose of § 505 is to shield children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed. To comply with § 505, the majority of cable operators adopted the ""time channeling"" approach, so that, for two-thirds of the day, no viewers in their service areas could receive the programming in question. Appellee Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., filed this suit challenging § 505's constitutionality. A three-judge District Court concluded that § 505's content-based restriction on speech violates the First Amendment because the Government might further its interests in less restrictive ways. One plausible, less restrictive alternative could be found in § 504 of the Act, which requires a cable operator, ""[u]pon request by a cable service subscriber ... without charge, [to] fully scramble or otherwise fully block"" any channel the subscriber does not wish to receive. As long as subscribers knew about this opportunity, the court reasoned, § 504 would provide as much protection against unwanted programming as would § 505. Held:  Because the Government failed to prove § 505 is the least restrictive means for addressing a real problem, the District Court did not err in holding the statute violative of the First Amendment. Pp.811-827. (a) Two points should be understood: (1) Many adults would find the material at issue highly offensive, and considering that the material comes unwanted into homes where children might see or hear it against parental wishes or consent, there are legitimate reasons for regulating it; and (2) Playboy's programming has First Amendment protection. 804 
Syllabus Section 505 is a content-based regulation. It also singles out particular programmers for regulation. It is of no moment that the statute does not impose a complete prohibition. Since § 505 is content based, it can stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny.  E. g., Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.  v.  FCC,  492 U. S. 115 , 126. It must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest, and if a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative. Cable television, like broadcast media, presents unique problems, but even where speech is indecent and enters the home, the objective of shielding children does not suffice to support a blanket ban if the protection can be obtained by a less restrictive alternative. There is, moreover, a key difference between cable television and the broadcasting media: Cable systems have the capacity to block unwanted channels on a household-by-household basis. Targeted blocking is less restrictive than banning, and the Government cannot ban speech if targeted blocking is a feasible and effective means of furthering its compelling interests. Pp. 811-815. (b) No one disputes that § 504 is narrowly tailored to the Government's goal of supporting parents who want sexually explicit channels blocked. The question here is whether § 504 can be effective. Despite empirical evidence that § 504 generated few requests for household-byhousehold blocking during a period when it was the sole federal blocking statute in effect, the District Court correctly concluded that § 504, if publicized in an adequate manner, could serve as an effective, less restrictive means of reaching the Government's goals. When the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.  E. g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc.  v.  United States,  527 U. S. 173 , 183. Of three explanations for the lack of individual blocking requests under § 504-(1) individual blocking might not be an effective alternative, due to technologicalor other limitations; (2) although an adequately advertised blocking provision might have been effective, § 504 as written does not require sufficient notice to make it so; and (3) the actual signal bleed problem might be far less of a concern than the Government at first had supposed-the Government had to show that the first was the right answer. According to the District Court, however, the first and third possibilities were ""equally consistent"" with the record before it, and the record was not clear as to whether enough notice had been issued to give § 504 a fighting chance. Unless the District Court's findings are clearly erroneous, the tie goes to free expression. With regard to signal bleed itself, the District Court's thorough discussion exposes a central weakness in the Government's proof: There is little hard evidence of how widespread 805 or how serious the problem is. There is no proof as to how likely any child is to view a discernible explicit image, and no proof of the duration of the bleed or the quality of the pictures or sound. Under § 505, sanctionable signal bleed can include instances as fleeting as an image appearing on a screen for just a few seconds. The First Amendment requires a more careful assessment and characterization of an evil in order to justify a regulation as sweeping as this. The Government has failed to establish a pervasive, nationwide problem justifying its nationwide daytime speech ban. The Government also failed to prove § 504, with adequate notice, would be ineffective. There is no evidence that a well-promoted voluntary blocking provision would not be capable at least of informing parents about signal bleed (if they are not yet aware of it) and about their rights to have the bleed blocked (if they consider it a problem and have not yet controlled it themselves). A court should not assume a plausible, less restrictive alternative would be ineffective; and a court should not presume parents, given full information, will fail to act. The Government also argues society's independent interests will be unserved if parents fail to act on that information. Even upon the assumption that the Government has an interest in substituting itself for informed and empowered parents, its interest is not sufficiently compelling to justify this widespread restriction on speech. The regulatory alternative of a publicized § 504, which has the real possibility of promoting more open disclosure and the choice of an effective blocking system, would provide parents the information needed to engage in active supervision. The Government has not shown that this alternative would be insufficient to secure its objective, or that any overriding harm justifies its intervention. Although, under a voluntary blocking regime, even with adequate notice, some children will be exposed to signal bleed, children will also be exposed under time channeling, which does not eliminate signal bleed around the clock. The record is silent as to the comparative effectiveness of the two alternatives. Pp. 816-826. 30 F. Supp. 2d 702, affirmed.

DOE, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS NEXT FRIEND FOR HER MINOR CHILDREN, ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
No. 99-62. Argued March 29, 2000-Decided June 19,2000 Prior to 1995, a student elected as Santa Fe High School's student council chaplain delivered a prayer over the public address system before each home varsity football game. Respondents, Mormon and Catholic students or alumni and their mothers, filed a suit challenging this practice and others under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. While the suit was pending, petitioner school district (District) adopted a different policy, which authorizes two student elections, the first to determine whether ""invocations"" should be delivered at games, and the second to select the spokesperson to deliver them. After the students held elections authorizing such prayers and selecting a spokesperson, the District Court entered an order modifying the policy to permit only nonsectarian, nonproselytizing prayer. The Fifth Circuit held that, even as modified by the District Court, the football prayer policy was invalid. Held:  The District's policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games violates the Establishment Clause. Pp.301-317. (a) The Court's analysis is guided by the principles endorsed in  Lee  v.  Weisman,  505 U. S. 577 . There, in concluding that a prayer delivered by a rabbi at a graduation ceremony violated the Establishment Clause, the Court held that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way that establishes a state religion or religious faith, or tends to do so,  id.,  at 587. The District argues unpersuasively that these principles are inapplicable because the policy's messages are private student speech, not public speech. The delivery of a message such as the invocation here-on school property, at school-sponsored events, over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer-is not properly characterized as ""private"" speech. Although the District relies heavily on this Court's cases addressing public forums,  e. g., Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,  515 U. S. 819 , it is clear that the District's 291 pregame ceremony is not the type of forum discussed in such cases. The District simply does not evince an intent to open its ceremony to indiscriminate use by the student body generally, see,  e. g., Hazelwood School Dist.  v.  Kuhlmeier,  484 U. S. 260 , 270, but, rather, allows only one student, the same student for the entire season, to give the invocation, which is subject to particular regulations that confine the content and topic of the student's message. The majoritarian process implemented by the District guarantees, by definition, that minority candidates will never prevail and that their views will be effectively silenced. See  Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System  v.  Southworth,  529 U. S. 217 , 235. Moreover, the District has failed to divorce itself from the invocations' religious content. The policy involves both perceived and actual endorsement of religion, see  Lee,  505 U. S., at 590, declaring that the student elections take place because the District ""has chosen to permit"" student-delivered invocations, that the invocation ""shall"" be conducted ""by the high school student council"" ""[u]pon advice and direction of the high school principal,"" and that it must be consistent with the policy's goals, which include ""solemniz[ing] the event."" A religious message is the most obvious method of solemnizing an event. Indeed, the only type of message expressly endorsed in the policy is an ""invocation,"" a term which primarily describes an appeal for divine assistance and, as used in the past at Santa Fe High School, has always entailed a focused religious message. A conclusion that the message is not ""private speech"" is also established by factors beyond the policy's text, including the official setting in which the invocation is delivered, see,  e. g., Wallace  v.  Jaffree,  472 U. S. 38 , 73, 76, by the policy's sham secular purposes, see  id.,  at 75, and by its history, which indicates that the District intended to preserve its long-sanctioned practice of prayer before football games, see  Lee,  505 U. S., at 596. Pp. 301-310. (b) The Court rejects the District's argument that its policy is distinguishable from the graduation prayer in  Lee  because it does not coerce students to participate in religious observances. The first part of this argument-that there is no impermissible government coercion because the pregame messages are the product of student choices-fails for the reasons discussed above explaining why the mechanism of the dual elections and student speaker do not turn public speech into private speech. The issue resolved in the first election was whether a student would deliver prayer at varsity football games, and the controversy in this case demonstrates that the students' views are not unanimous on that issue. One of the Establishment Clause's purposes is to remove debate over this kind of issue from governmental supervision or control. See  Lee,  505 U. S., at 589. Although the ultimate choice of student speaker is attributable to the students, the District's de- 292 cision to hold the constitutionally problematic election is clearly a choice attributable to the State,  id.,  at 587. The second part of the District's argument-that there is no coercion here because attendance at an extracurricular event, unlike a graduation ceremony, is voluntary-is unpersuasive. For some students, such as cheerleaders, members of the band, and the team members themselves, attendance at football games is mandated, sometimes for class credit. The District's argument also minimizes the immense social pressure, or truly genuine desire, felt by many students to be involved in the extracurricular event that is American high school football.  Id.,  at 593. The Constitution demands that schools not force on students the difficult choice between attending these games and avoiding personally offensive religious rituals. See  id.,  at 596. Pp. 310-313. (c) The Court also rejects the District's argument that respondents' facial challenge to the policy necessarily must fail because it is premature: No invocation has as yet been delivered under the policy. This argument assumes that the Court is concerned only with the serious constitutional injury that occurs when a student is forced to participate in an act of religious worship because she chooses to attend a school event. But the Constitution also requires that the Court keep in mind the myriad, subtle ways in which Establishment Clause values can be eroded,  Lynch  v.  Donnelly,  465 U. S. 668 , 694, and guard against other different, yet equally important, constitutional injuries. One is the mere passage by the District of a policy that has the purpose and perception of government establishment of religion. See,  e. g., Bowen  v.  Kendrick,  487 U. S. 589 , 602;  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403 U. S. 602 , 612. As discussed above, the policy's text and the circumstances surrounding its enactment reveal that it has such a purpose. Another constitutional violation warranting the Court's attention is the District's implementation of an electoral process that subjects the issue of prayer to a majoritarian vote. Through its election scheme, the District has established a governmental mechanism that turns the school into a forum for religious debate and empowers the student body majority to subject students of minority views to constitutionally improper messages. The award of that power alone is not acceptable. Cf.  Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System  v.  Southworth,  529 U. S. 217 . For the foregoing reasons, the policy is invalid on its face.

Argued December 1, 1999-Decided June 28, 2000 Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 channels federal funds via state educational agencies (SEA's) to local educational agencies (LEA's), which in turn lend educational materials and equipment, such as library and media materials and computer software and hardware, to public and private elementary and secondary schools to implement ""secular, neutral, and nonideological"" programs. The enrollment of each participating school determines the amount of Chapter 2 aid that it receives. In an average year, about 30% of Chapter 2 funds spent in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, are allocated for private schools, most of which are Catholic or otherwise religiously affiliated. Respondents filed suit alleging, among other things, that Chapter 2, as applied in the parish, violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. Agreeing, the Chief Judge of the District Court held, under  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403 U. S. 602 , 612-613, that Chapter 2 had the primary effect of advancing religion because the materials and equipment loaned to the Catholic schools were direct aid and the schools were pervasively sectarian. He relied primarily on  Meek  v.  Pittenger, 421  U. S. 349, and  Wolman  v.  Walter,  433 U. S. 229 , in which programs providing many of the same sorts of materials and equipment as does Chapter 2 were struck down, even though programs providing for the loan of public school textbooks to religious schools were upheld. After the judge issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian schools in the parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment, he retired. Another judge then reversed that order, upholding Chapter 2 under,  inter alia, Zobrest  v.  Catalina Foothills School Dist.,  509 U. S. 1 , in which a public school district was allowed to provide a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school as part of a federal program for the disabled. While respondents' appeal was pending, this Court decided  Agostini  v.  Felton,  521 U. S. 203 , approving a program under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 that provided public employees to teach remedial classes at religious and other private schools. Concluding that  Agostini  had neither directly overruled  Meek  and  Wolman  nor rejected their distinction between textbooks and other in-kind aid, the Fifth Circuit relied on those two cases to invalidate Chapter 2. 794 Syllabus Held:  The judgment is reversed.  151 F.3d 347 , reversed."

VELAZQUEZ ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT No. 99-603. Argued October 4, 2000-Decided February 28, 2001 * The Legal Services Corporation Act authorizes petitioner Legal Services Corporation (LSC) to distribute funds appropriated by Congress to local grantee organizations providing free legal assistance to indigent clients in,  inter alia,  welfare benefits claims. In every annual appropriations Act since 1996, Congress has prohibited LSC funding of any organization that represented clients in an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law. Grantees cannot continue representation in a welfare matter even where a constitutional or statutory validity challenge becomes apparent after representation is well under way. Respondents-lawyers employed by LSC grantees, together with othersfiled suit to declare,  inter alia,  the restriction invalid. The District Court denied them a preliminary injunction, but the Second Circuit invalidated the restriction, finding it impermissible viewpoint discrimination that violated the First Amendment. Held:  The funding restriction violates the First Amendment. Pp.540-549. (a) LSC and the Government, also a petitioner, claim that  Rust  v. Sullivan,  500 U. S. 173 , in which this Court upheld a restriction prohibiting doctors employed by federally funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion with their patients, supports the restriction here. However, the Court has since explained that the  Rust  counseling activities amounted to governmental speech, sustaining viewpoint-based funding decisions in instances in which the government is itself the speaker, see  Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System  v.  Southworth,  529 U. S. 217 ,229,235, or instances, like  Rust,  in which the government uses private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its own program,  Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,  515 U. S. 819 , 833. Although the government has the latitude to ensure that its own message is being delivered, neither that latitude nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance. Like the  Rosenberger *Together with No. 99-960,  United States  v.  Velazquez et al.,  also on certiorari to the same court. 534 program, the LSC program was designed to facilitate private speech, not to promote a governmental message. An LSC attorney speaks on behalf of a private, indigent client in a welfare benefits claim, while the Government's message is delivered by the attorney defending the benefits decision. The attorney's advice to the client and advocacy to the courts cannot be classified as governmental speech even under a generous understanding of that concept. In this vital respect this suit is distinguishable from  Rust.  Pp. 540-543. (b) The private nature of the instant speech, and the extent of LSC's regulation of private expression, are indicated further by the circumstance that the Government seeks to control an existing medium of expression in ways which distort its usual functioning. Cases involving a limited forum, though not controlling, provide instruction for evaluating restrictions in governmental subsidies. Here the program presumes that private, nongovernmental speech is necessary, and a substantial restriction is placed upon that speech. By providing subsidies to LSC, the Government seeks to facilitate suits for benefits by using the State and Federal Judiciaries and the independent bar on which they depend for the proper performance of their duties and responsibilities. Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the attorneys' traditional role in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases of  Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n  v.  Forbes,  523 U. S. 666 , and  Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., supra.  The Government may not design a subsidy to effect such a serious and fundamental restriction on the advocacy of attorneys and the functioning of the judiciary. An informed, independent judiciary presumes an informed, independent bar. However, the instant restriction prevents LSC attorneys from advising the courts of serious statutory validity questions. It also threatens severe impairment of the judicial function by sifting out cases presenting constitutional challenges in order to insulate the Government's laws from judicial inquiry. The result of this restriction would be two tiers of cases. There would be lingering doubt whether an LSC attorney's truncated representation had resulted in complete analysis of the case, full advice to the client, and proper presentation to the court; and the courts and the public would come to question the adequacy and fairness of professional representations when the attorney avoided all reference to statutory validity and constitutional authority questions. A scheme so inconsistent with accepted separation-of-powers principles is an insufficient basis to sustain or uphold the restriction on speech. Pp. 543-546. 535 (c) That LSC attorneys can withdraw does not make the restriction harmless, for the statute is an attempt to draw lines around the LSC program to exclude from litigation arguments and theories Congress finds unacceptable but which by their nature are within the courts' province to consider. The restriction is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws, the indigent client is unlikely to find other counsel. There may be no alternative source of vital information on the client's constitutional or statutory rights, in stark contrast to  Rust,  where a patient could receive both governmentally subsidized counseling and consultation with independent or affiliate organizations. Finally, notwithstanding Congress' purpose to confine and limit its program, the restriction insulates current welfare laws from constitutional scrutiny and certain other legal challenges, a condition implicating central First Amendment concerns. There can be little doubt that the LSC Act funds constitutionally protected expression; and there is no programmatic message of the kind recognized in  Rust  and which sufficed there to allow the Government to specify the advice deemed necessary for its legitimate objectives. Pp. 546-549. (d) The Court of Appeals concluded that the funding restriction could be severed from the statute, leaving the remaining portions operative. Because that determination was not contested here, the Court in the exercise of its discretion and prudential judgment declines to address it. P. 549. 164 F.3d 757 , affirmed.

MURPHY CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT No. 99-1613. Argued January 16, 200l-Decided April 18, 2001 While respondent Murphy was incarcerated in state prison, he learned that a fellow inmate had been charged with assaulting a correctional officer. Murphy decided to assist the inmate with his defense and sent him a letter, which was intercepted in accordance with prison policy. Based on the letter's content, the prison sanctioned Murphy for violating prison rules prohibiting insolence and interfering with due process hearings. Murphy then sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging that the disciplinary action violated,  inter alia,  his First Amendment rights, including the right to provide legal assistance to other inmates. In granting petitioners summary judgment, the District Court applied the decision in  Turner  v.  Safley, 482  U. S. 78, 89-that a prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional rights is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests-and found a valid, rational connection between the inmate correspondence policy and the objectives of prison order, security, and inmate rehabilitation. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that inmates have a First Amendment right to give legal assistance to other inmates and that this right affected the  Turner  analysis. Held: 1. Inmates do not possess a special First Amendment right to provide legal assistance to fellow inmates that enhances the protections otherwise available under  Turner.  Prisoners' constitutional rights are more limited in scope than the constitutional rights held by individuals in society at large. For instance, some First Amendment rights are simply inconsistent with the corrections system's ""legitimate penological objectives,""  Pell  v.  Procunier,  417 U. S. 817 ,822, and thus this Court has sustained restrictions on,  e.  g., inmate-to-inmate written correspondence,  Turner, supra,  at 93. Moreover, because courts are ill equipped to deal with the complex and intractable problems of prisons,  Procunier  v.  Martinez,  416 U. S. 396 , 404-405, this Court has generally deferred to prison officials' judgment in upholding such regulations against constitutional challenge.  Turner  reflects this understanding, setting a unitary, deferential standard for reviewing prisoners' claims that does not permit an increase in the constitutional protection whenever a prisoner's communication includes legal advice. To increase 224 Syllabus the constitutional protection based upon a communication's content first requires an assessment of that content's value. But the  Turner  test simply does not accommodate valuations of content. On the contrary, it concerns only the relationship between the asserted penological interests and the prison regulation. Moreover, prison officials are to remain the primary arbiters of the problems that arise in prison management. 482 U. S., at 89. Seeking to avoid unnecessarily perpetuating federal courts' involvement in prison administration affairs, the Court rejects an alteration of the  Turner  analysis that would entail additional federal-court oversight. Even if this Court were to consider giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based on content, it would not do so for speech that includes legal advice. Augmenting First Amendment protection for such advice would undermine prison officials' ability to address the complex and intractable problems of prison administration.  Id.,  at 84. The legal text could be an excuse for making clearly inappropriate comments, which may circulate among prisoners despite prison measures to screen individual inmates or officers from the remarks. Pp. 228-232. 2. To prevail on remand on the question whether the prison regulations, as applied to Murphy, are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, he must overcome the presumption that the prison officials acted within their broad discretion.

VOPPER, AKA WILLIAMS, ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT No. 99-1687. Argued December 5, 2000-Decided May 21, 2001* During contentious collective-bargaining negotiations between a union representing teachers at a Pennsylvania high school and the local school board, an unidentified person intercepted and recorded a cell phone conversation between the chief union negotiator and the union president (hereinafter petitioners). After the parties accepted a nonbinding arbitration proposal generally favorable to the teachers, respondent Vopper, a radio commentator, played a tape of the intercepted conversation on his public affairs talk show in connection with news reports about the settlement. Petitioners filed this damages suit under both federal and state wiretapping laws, alleging, among other things, that their conversation had been surreptitiously intercepted by an unknown person; that respondent Yocum, the head of a local organization opposed to the union's demands, had obtained the tape and intentionally disclosed it to,  inter alios,  media representatives; and that they had repeatedly published the conversation even though they knew or had reason to know that it had been illegally intercepted. In ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court concluded that, under the statutory language, an individual violates the federal Act by intentionally disclosing the contents of an electronic communication when he or she knows or has reason to know that the information was obtained through an illegal interception, even if the individual was not involved in that interception; found that the question whether the interception was intentional raised a genuine issue of material fact; and rejected respondents' defense that they were protected by the First Amendment even if the disclosures violated the statutes, finding that the statutes were content-neutral laws of general applicability containing no indicia of prior restraint or the chilling of free speech. The Third Circuit accepted an interlocutory appeal, and the United States, also a petitioner, intervened to defend the federal Act's constitutionality. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found the statutes invalid because they deterred significantly more speech than necessary to protect the private *Together with No. 99-1728,  United States  v.  Vopper, aka Williams,  et al., also on certiorari to the same court. 515 interests at stake, and remanded the case with instructions to enter summary judgment for respondents. Held:  The First Amendment protects the disclosures made by respondents in this suit. Pp. 522-535. (a) Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended, generally prohibits the interception of wire, electronic, and oral communications. Title 18 U. S. C. § 2511(I)(a) applies to the person who willfully intercepts such communications and subsection (c) to any person who, knowing or having reason to know that the communication was obtained through an illegal interception, willfully discloses its contents. Pp. 522-524. (b) Because of this suit's procedural posture, the Court accepts that the interception was unlawful and that respondents had reason to know that. Accordingly, the disclosures violated the statutes. In answering the remaining question whether the statutes' application in such circumstances violates the First Amendment, the Court accepts respondents' submissions that they played no part in the illegal interception, that their access to the information was obtained lawfully, and that the conversations dealt with a matter of public concern. Pp. 524-525. (c) Section 2511(I)(c) is a content-neutral law of general applicability. The statute's purpose is to protect the privacy of wire, electronic, and oral communications, and it singles out such communications by virtue of the fact that they were illegally intercepted-by virtue of the source rather than the subject matter. Cf.  Ward  v.  Rock Against Racism, 491  U. S. 781, 791. On the other hand, the prohibition against disclosures is fairly characterized as a regulation of speech. Pp. 526-527. (d) In  New York Times Co.  v.  United States,  403 U. S. 713 , this Court upheld the press' right to publish information of great public concern obtained from documents stolen by a third party. In so doing, this Court focused on the stolen documents' character and the consequences of public disclosure, not on the fact that the documents were stolen.  Ibid.  It also left open the question whether, in cases where information has been acquired unlawfully by a newspaper or by a source, government may punish not only the unlawful acquisition, but also the ensuing publication.  Florida Star  v.  B.  J. F.,  491 U. S. 524 , 535, n. 8. The issue here is a narrower version of that question: Where the publisher has lawfully obtained information from a source who obtained it unlawfully, may the government punish the ensuing publication based on the defect in a chain? The Court's refusal to construe the issue more broadly is consistent with its repeated refusal to answer categorically whether the publication of truthful information may ever be punished consistent with the First Amendment. Accordingly, the Court considers whether, 516 Syllabus given the facts here, the interests served by § 2511(1)(c) justify its restrictions on speech. Pp. 527-529. (e) The first interest identified by the Government-removing an incentive for parties to intercept private conversations-does not justify applying § 2511(1)(c) to an otherwise innocent disclosure of public information. The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to punish the person engaging in it. It would be remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding possessor of information can be suppressed in order to deter conduct by a non-law-abiding third party. In virtually all § 2511(1)(a), (c), or (d) violations, the interceptor's identity has been known. There is no evidence that Congress thought that the prohibition against disclosures would deter illegal interceptions, and no evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition reduces the number of such interceptions. pp. 529-532. (f) The Government's second interest-minimizing the harm to persons whose conversations have been illegally intercepted-is considerably stronger. Privacy of communication is an important interest. However, in this suit, privacy concerns give way when balanced against the interest in publishing matters of public importance. One of the costs associated with participation in public affairs is an attendant loss of privacy. The profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide open supported this Court's holding in  New York Times Co.  v.  Sullivan, 376  U. S. 254, that neither factual error nor defamatory content, nor a combination of the two, sufficed to remove the First Amendment shield from criticism of official conduct. Parallel reasoning requires the conclusion that a stranger's illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.

MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT No. 99-2036. Argued February 28, 200l-Decided June 11,2001 Under New York law, respondent Milford Central School (Milford) enacted a policy authorizing district residents to use its building after school for, among other things, (1) instruction in education, learning, or the arts and (2) social, civic, recreational, and entertainment uses pertaining to the community welfare. Stephen and Darleen Fournier, district residents eligible to use the school's facilities upon approval of their proposed use, are sponsors of the Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children ages 6 to 12. Pursuant to Milford's policy, they submitted a request to hold the Club's weekly afterschool meetings in the school. Milford denied the request on the ground that the proposed use-to sing songs, hear Bible lessons, memorize scripture, and pray-was the equivalent of religious worship prohibited by the community use policy. Petitioners (collectively, the Club), filed suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging,  inter alia,  that the denial of the Club's application violated its free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court ultimately granted Milford summary judgment, finding the Club's subject matter to be religious in nature, not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious perspective that Milford otherwise permits. Because the school had not allowed other groups providing religious instruction to use its limited public forum, the court held that it could deny the Club access without engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. In affirming, the Second Circuit rejected the Club's contention that Milford's restriction was unreasonable, and held that, because the Club's subject matter was quintessentially religious and its activities fell outside the bounds of pure moral and character development, Milford's policy was constitutional subject discrimination, not unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Held: 1. Milford violated the Club's free speech rights when it excluded the Club from meeting after hours at the school. Pp. 106-112. (a) Because the parties so agree, this Court assumes that Milford operates a limited public forum. A State establishing such a forum is not required to and does not allow persons to engage in every type of 99 speech. It may be justified in reserving its forum for certain groups or the discussion of certain topics.  E. g., Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,  515 U. S. 819 , 829. The power to so restrict speech, however, is not without limits. The restriction must not discriminate against speech based on viewpoint,  ibid.,  and must be reasonable in light of the forum's purpose,  Cornelius  v.  NAACP Legal Defense  &  Ed. Fund, Inc.,  473 U. S. 788 ,806. Pp. 106-107. (b) By denying the Club access to the school's limited public forum on the ground that the Club was religious in nature, Milford discriminated against the Club because of its religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause. That exclusion is indistinguishable from the exclusions held violative of the Clause in  Lamb's Chapel  v.  Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,  508 U. S. 384 , where a school district precluded a private group from presenting films at the school based solely on the religious perspective of the films, and in  Rosenberger,  where a university refused to fund a student publication because it addressed issues from a religious perspective. The only apparent difference between the activities of Lamb's Chapel and the Club is the inconsequential distinction that the Club teaches moral lessons from a Christian perspective through live storytelling and prayer, whereas Lamb's Chapel taught lessons through films.  Rosenberger  also is dispositive: Given the obvious religious content of the publication there at issue, it cannot be said that the Club's activities are any more ""religious"" or deserve any less Free Speech Clause protection. This Court disagrees with the Second Circuit's view that something that is quintessentially religious or decidedly religious in nature cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. What matters for Free Speech Clause purposes is that there is no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons. Because Milford's restriction is viewpoint discriminatory, the Court need not decide whether it is unreasonable in light of the forum's purposes. Pp. 107-112. 2. Permitting the Club to meet on the school's premises would not have violated the Establishment Clause. Establishment Clause defenses similar to Milford's were rejected in  Lamb's Chapel, supra,  at 395-where the Court found that, because the films would not have been shown during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church members, there was no realistic danger that the community would think that the district was endorsing religion-and in  Widmar  v.  Vincent,  454 U. S. 263 , 272-273, and n. 13-where a university's forum was 100 100 GOOD NEWS CLUB  v.  MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL 
Syllabus already available to other groups. Because the Club's activities are materially indistinguishable from those in  Lamb's Chapel  and  Widmar,  Milford's reliance on the Establishment Clause is unavailing. As in  Lamb's Chapel,  the Club's meetings were to be held after school hours, not sponsored by the school, and open to any student who obtained parental consent, not just to Club members. As in  Widmar,  Milford made its forum available to other organizations. The Court rejects Milford's attempt to distinguish those cases by emphasizing that its policy involves elementary school children who will perceive that the school is endorsing the Club and will feel coerced to participate because the Club's activities take place on school grounds, even though they occur during nonschool hours. That argument is unpersuasive for a number of reasons. (1) Allowing the Club to speak on school grounds would ensure, not threaten, neutrality toward religion. Accordingly, Milford faces an uphill battle in arguing that the Establishment Clause compels it to exclude the Club. See,  e. g., Rosenberger, supra,  at 839. (2) To the extent the Court considers whether the community would feel coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities, cf.  Lee  v.  Weisman,  505 U. S. 577 , 592-593, the relevant community is the parents who choose whether their children will attend Club meetings, not the children themselves. (3) Whatever significance it may have assigned in the Establishment Clause context to the suggestion that elementary school children are more impressionable than adults, cf.,  e.  g., id., at 592, the Court has never foreclosed private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present.  Lee, supra,  at 592, and  Edwards  v.  Aguillard,  482 U. S. 578 , 584, distinguished. (4) Even if the Court were to consider the possible misperceptions by schoolchildren in deciding whether there is an Establishment Clause violation, the facts of this case simply do not support Milford's conclusion. Finally, it cannot be said that the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded from the public forum. Because it is not convinced that there is any significance to the possibility that elementary school children may witness the Club's activities on school premises, the Court can find no reason to depart from  Lamb's Chapel  and  Widmar.  Pp. 112-119. 3. Because Milford has not raised a valid Establishment Clause claim, this Court does not address whether such a claim could excuse Milford's viewpoint discrimination.

No. 00-276. Argued April 17, 200l-Decided June 25, 2001 The Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act mandates that fresh mushroom handlers pay assessments used primarily to fund advertisements promoting mushroom sales. Respondent refused to pay the assessment, claiming that it violates the First Amendment. It filed a petition challenging the assessment with the Secretary of Agriculture, and the United States filed an enforcement action in the District Court. After the administrative appeal was denied, respondent sought review in the District Court, which consolidated the two cases. In granting the Government summary judgment, the court found dispositive the decision in  Glickman  v.  Wileman Brothers  &  Elliott, Inc.,  521 U. S. 457 , that the First Amendment was not violated when agricultural marketing orders, as part of a larger regulatory marketing scheme, required producers of California tree fruit to pay assessments for product advertising. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that  Glickman  did not control because the mandated payments in this case were not part of a comprehensive statutory agricultural marketing program. Held: The assessment requirement violates the First Amendment. Pp. 409-417. (a) Even viewing the expression here as commercial speech, there is no basis under  Glickman  or this Court's other precedents to sustain the assessments. The First Amendment may prevent the government from,  inter alia,  compelling individuals to pay subsidies for speech to which they object. See  Abood  v.  Detroit Bd. of Ed.,  431 U. S. 209 ;  Keller  v.  State Bar of Gal.,  496 U. S. 1 . Such precedents provide the beginning point for analysis here. Respondent wants to convey the message that its brand of mushrooms is superior to those grown by other producers, and it objects to being charged for a contrary message which seems to be favored by a majority of producers. First Amendment values are at serious risk if the government can compel a citizen or group of citizens to subsidize speech on the side that it favors; and there is no apparent principle distinguishing out of hand minor debates about whether a branded mushroom is better than just any mushroom. Thus, the compelled funding here must pass First Amendment scrutiny. Pp.409-411. 406 (b) The program sustained in  Glickman  differs from the one at issue here in a fundamental respect: The mandated assessments for speech in that case were ancillary to a more comprehensive program restricting marketing autonomy. This Court stressed in  Glickman  that the entire regulatory program must be considered in resolving a case. There, California tree fruits were marketed under detailed marketing orders that had displaced competition to such an extent that they had an antitrust exemption; the Court presumed that the producers compelled to contribute funds for cooperative advertising were bound together and required by statute to market their products according to cooperative rules. Those important features are not present here. Most of the funds at issue are used for generic advertising; and there are no marketing orders regulating mushroom production and sales, no antitrust exemption, and nothing preventing individual producers from making their own marketing decisions. Mushroom growers are not forced to associate as a group that makes cooperative decisions. Although respondent is required simply to support speech by others, not to utter speech itself, that mandated support is contrary to the First Amendment principles set forth in cases involving expression by groups which include persons who object to the speech but, nevertheless, must remain group members by law or necessity. See,  e. g., Abood, supra; Keller, supra.  Properly applied,  Abood's  rule protecting against compelled assessments for some speech requires this scheme to be invalidated. Before addressing whether a conflict with freedom of belief exists, the threshold inquiry must be whether there is some state imposed obligation making group membership less than voluntary; for it is only the overriding associational purpose which allows any compelled subsidy for speech in the first place. In  Abood, Keller,  and  Glickman,  the objecting members were required to associate for purposes other than the compelled subsidies for speech. Here, however, the only program the Government contends the assessments serve is the very advertising scheme in question. Were it sufficient to say speech is germane to itself,  Abood's  and  Keller's  limits would be empty of meaning and significance. No corollary to  Glickman's  cooperative marketing structure exists here; the expression respondent is required to support is not germane to an association's purpose independent from the speech itself; and  Abood's  rationale extends to the party who objects to the compelled support for this speech. There is also no suggestion here that the assessments are necessary to make voluntary advertisements nonmisleading for consumers.  Zauderer  v.  Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,  471 U. S. 626 , distinguished. 407 Because the Government did not raise in the Sixth Circuit its theory that this case is permissible government speech, this Court will not entertain that argument here.

COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT No.00-191. Argued February 28, 200l-Decided June 25, 2001 In  Buckley  v.  Valeo,  424 U. S. 1 , 12-59, this Court held that the limitations on political campaign contributions in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 were generally constitutional, but that the Act's limitations on election expenditures infringed political expression in violation of the First Amendment. Later cases have respected this line between contributing and spending. The distinction's simplicity is qualified, however, by the Act's provision for a functional, not formal, definition of ""contribution,"" which includes ""expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with ... a candidate,"" 2 U. S. C. § 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). Thus, expenditures coordinated with a candidate are contributions under the Act. The Federal Election Commission (FE C) originally took the position that any expenditure by a political party in connection with a federal election was presumed to be coordinated with the party's candidate. See,  e. g., Federal Election Comm'n  v.  Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm.,  454 U. S. 27 , 2829, n. 1. The FEC thus assumed that all expenditure limits imposed on political parties were, in essence, contribution limits and therefore constitutional. Such limits include § 441a(d)(3), which imposes spending limits on national and state political parties with respect to United States Senate elections. In  Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.  v.  Federal Election Comm'n,  518 U. S. 604   (Colorado I),  the spending limits in § 441a(d)(3) (referred to as the Party Expenditure Provision), were held unconstitutional as applied to the independent expenditures of the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (Party) in connection with a senatorial campaign. The principal opinion ruled the payments ""independent,"" rather than coordinated, expenditures under this Court's cases because the Party spent the money before selecting its own senatorial candidate and without any arrangement with potential nominees.  Id.,  at 613-614. The principal opinion remanded the Party's broader claim that all limits on a party's congressional campaign expenditures are facially unconstitutional and thus un- 432 
Syllabus enforceable even as to spending coordinated with a candidate.  Id.,  at 623-626. On remand, the District Court held for the Party on that claim, and a divided Tenth Circuit panel affirmed. Held:  Because a party's coordinated expenditures, unlike expenditures truly independent, may be restricted to minimize circumvention of the Act's contribution limits, the Party's facial challenge is rejected. Pp.440-465. (a) Political expenditure limits deserve closer scrutiny than contribution restrictions,  e.  g.,  Buckley,  424 U. S., at 14-23, because expenditure restraints generally curb more expressive and associational activity than contribution limits,  e.  g., id., at 19-23, and because unlimited contributions are more clearly linked to political corruption than other kinds of unlimited political spending, at least where the spending is not coordinated with a candidate or his campaign,  e.  g., id., at 47. Although the First Amendment line is easy to draw when it falls between independent expenditures by individuals or political action committees (PACs) without any candidate's approval and contributions in the form of cash gifts to candidates, see,  e.  g., id., at 19-23, facts speak less clearly once the independence of the spending cannot be taken for granted. Congress's functional treatment of coordinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty groups like contributions prevents attempts to circumvent the Act through coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions.  Id.,  at 47.  Buckley,  in fact, enhanced the significance of this functional treatment by striking down independent expenditure limits on First Amendment grounds while upholding limitations on contributions (by individuals and nonparty groups), as defined to include coordinated expenditures.  Id.,  at 23-59.  Colorado I  addressed the FEC's effort to stretch the functional treatment one step further. Because  Buckley  had treated some coordinated expenditures like contributions and upheld their limitation, the FEC's argument went, the Party Expenditure Provision should stand as applied to all party election spending, see,  e.  g., 518 U. S., at 619-623. Holding otherwise, the principal opinion found that, because ""independent"" party expenditures are no more likely to serve corruption than independent expenditures by anyone else, there was no justification for subjecting party election spending across the board to the kinds of limits previously invalidated when applied to individuals and nonparty groups. See id., at 616. But that still left the question whether the First Amendment allows coordinated election expenditures by parties to be treated functionally as contributions, the way coordinated expenditures by other entities are treated. The issue in this case is, accordingly, whether a party is in a different position from other political speakers, giving it a claim to de- 433 mand a higher standard of scrutiny before its coordinated spending can be limited. Pp. 440-445. (b) The Party's argument that its coordinated spending, like its independent spending, should be left free from restriction under the  Buckley  line of cases boils down to this: because a party's most important speech is aimed at electing candidates and is itself expressed through those candidates, any limit on party support for a candidate imposes a unique First Amendment burden. Limitation of any party expenditure coordinated with a candidate, the Party contends, is therefore a serious, rather than incidental, imposition on the party's speech and associative purpose, which justifies a stricter level of scrutiny than has been applied to analogous limits on individuals and nonparty groups. But whatever level of scrutiny is applied to such a limit, the Party argues, the burden on a party reflects a fatal mismatch between the effects of limiting coordinated party expenditures and the prevention of corruption or its appearance. In contrast, the Government's argument for characterizing coordinated spending like contributions goes back to  Buckley,  which, in effect, subjected limits on coordinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty groups to the same scrutiny it applied to limits on their cash contributions. The standard of scrutiny requires the limit to be closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest, though the limit's dollar amount need not be fine tuned. See,  e. g., Buckley, supra,  at 25, 30. The Government develops this rationale a step further here, arguing that a party's coordinated spending should be limited not only because it is like a party contribution, but because giving a party the right to make unlimited coordinated expenditures would induce those wishing to support a nominee to contribute to the party in order to finance coordinated spending for that candidate, thereby increasing circumvention and bypassing the limits  Buckley  upheld. Pp. 445-447. (c) Although each of the competing positions is plausible at first blush, evaluation of the arguments prompts rejection of the Party's claim to suffer a burden unique in any way that should make a categorical difference under the First Amendment. And the Government's contentions are ultimately borne out by evidence, entitling it to prevail in its characterization of party coordinated spending as the functional equivalent of contributions. pp.447-460. (1) The Party's argument that unrestricted coordinated spending is essential to a party's nature because of its unique relationship with candidates has been rendered implausible by nearly 30 years' history under the Act. Since 1974, a party's coordinated spending in a given race has been limited by the provision challenged here (or its predecessor). It was not until the 1996  Colorado I  decision that any spending was allowed above that amount, and since then only independent 434 
Syllabus spending has been unlimited. Thus, the Party's claim that coordinated spending beyond the Act's limit is essential to its very function as a party amounts implicitly to saying that for almost three decades political parties have not been quite functional or have been functioning in systematic violation of the law. The Court cannot accept either implication. Pp. 449-450. (2) There is a different weakness in the seemingly unexceptionable premise that parties are organized for the purpose of electing candidates, so that imposing on the way parties serve that function is uniquely burdensome. The fault here is a refusal to see how the power of money actually works in the political structure. Looking directly at a party's function in getting and spending money, it would ignore reality to think that the party role is adequately described by speaking generally of electing particular candidates. Parties are necessarily the instruments of some contributors, such as PACs, whose object is not to support the party's message or to elect party candidates, but rather to support a specific candidate for the sake of a position on one, narrow issue, or even to support any candidate who will be obliged to contributors. Parties thus perform functions more complex than simply electing their candidates: they act as agents for spending on behalf of those who seek to produce obligated officeholders. It is this party role, which functionally unites parties with other self-interested political actors, that the Party Expenditure Provision targets. Pp. 450-452. (3) The Court agrees insofar as the Party suggests that its strong working relationship with candidates and its unique ability to speak in coordination with them should be taken into account in the First Amendment analysis. It is the accepted understanding that a party combines its members' power to speak by aggregating their contributions and broadcasting its messages more widely than its individual contributors generally could afford to do, and it marshals this power with greater sophistication than individuals generally could, using such mechanisms as speech coordinated with a candidate. Cf.  Colorado I,  518 U. S., at 637. It does not, however, follow from a party's efficiency in getting large sums and spending intelligently that limits on a party's coordinated spending should be scrutinized under an unusually high standard. In fact, any argument from sophistication and power would cut both ways. On the one hand, one can seek the benefit of stricter scrutiny of a law capping party coordinated spending by emphasizing the heavy burden imposed by limiting the most effective mechanism of sophisticated spending. And yet it is exactly this efficiency culminating in coordinated spending that (on the Government's view) places a party in a position to be used to circumvent contribution limits that apply to individuals and PACs, and thereby to exacerbate the threat of 435 corruption and apparent corruption that those contribution limits are aimed at reducing. Pp. 453-454. (4) The preceding question assumes that parties enjoy a power and experience that sets them apart from other political spenders. But in fact the assumption is too crude. Like a party, rich individual donors, media executives, and PACs have the means to speak loudly and the capacity to work in tandem with a candidate. Yet all of them are subject to the coordinated spending limits upheld in  Buckley,  424 U. S., at 46-47. A party is also like some of these political actors in its right under  Colorado I  to spend money in support of a candidate without legal limit so long as it spends independently. A party is not, therefore, in a unique position, but is in the same position as some individuals and PACs. Pp.454-455. (5) Because the Party's arguments do not pan out, the Court applies to a party's coordinated spending limitation the same scrutiny it has applied to the other political actors, that is, scrutiny appropriate for a contribution limit, enquiring whether the restriction is ""closely drawn"" to match the ""sufficiently important"" government interest in combating political corruption.  E.  g.,  Nixon  v.  Shrink Missouri Government PAC,  528 U. S. 377 , 387-388. Pp.455-456. (6) Under that standard, adequate evidentiary grounds exist to sustain the coordinated spending limit for parties. Substantial evidence demonstrates how candidates, donors, and parties test the current law's limits, and it shows beyond serious doubt how those contribution limits would be eroded if inducement to circumvent them were enhanced by declaring parties' coordinated spending wide open. Under the Act, a donor is limited to $2,000 in contributions to one candidate in a given election cycle. The same donor may give as much as another $20,000 each year to a national party committee supporting the candidate. The evidence shows that what a realist would expect to occur has occurred. Donors give to the party with the tacit understanding that the favored candidate will benefit. Testimony shows that, although the understanding between donor and party may involve no definite commitment and may be tacit on the donor's part, the frequency of the practice and the volume of money involved has required parties to adopt tallying procedures to connect donors to candidates. If suddenly every dollar of spending could be coordinated with the candidate, the inducement to circumvent would almost certainly intensify. Pp. 457-460. (d) The Party's attempts to minimize the threat of corruption by circumvention are unavailing. Its claim that most contributions to parties are small, with negligible corrupting momentum to be carried through the party conduit, is unpersuasive given the evidence that, even under present law, substantial donations turn the parties into matchmakers 436 
Syllabus whose special meetings and receptions give donors the chance to get their points across to the candidates. The fact that incumbent candidates give more excess campaign funds to parties than parties spend on coordinated expenditures does not defuse concern over circumvention; if party contributions were not used as a funnel from donors to candidates, there would be no reason for the tallying system described by the witnesses. Finally, the Court rejects the Party's claim that, even if there is a circumvention threat, the First Amendment demands a response better tailored to that threat than a limitation on coordinated spending. First, the Party's suggestion that better crafted safeguards are already in place in § 441a(a)(8)-which provides that contributions that are earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary to a candidate are treated as contributions to the candidate-ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and directly combating circumvention when contributions go into a general party treasury and candidatefundraisers are rewarded with something less obvious than dollar-fordollar pass-throughs. Second, although the Party's call for replacing limits on parties' coordinated expenditures with limits on contributions to parties is based in part on reasoning in  Buckley, supra,  at 44, and  Colorado I, supra,  at 617, those cases ultimately turned on the understanding that the expenditures at issue were independent and therefore functionally true expenditures, whereas, here, just the opposite is true.

ET AL.  v.  REILLY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS, ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
No. 00-596. Argued April 25, 200l-Decided June 28, 2001* After the Attorney General of Massachusetts (Attorney General) promulgated comprehensive regulations governing the advertising and sale of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars, petitioners, a group of tobacco manufacturers and retailers, filed this suit asserting, among other things, the Supremacy Clause claim that the cigarette advertising regulations are pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), which prescribes mandatory health warnings for cigarette packaging and advertising, 15 U. S. C. § 1333, and pre-empts similar state regulations, § 1334(b); and a claim that the regulations violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. In large measure, the District Court upheld the regulations. Among its rulings, the court held that restrictions on the location of advertising were not pre-empted by the FCLAA, and that neither the regulations prohibiting outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground nor the sales practices regulations restricting the location and distribution of tobacco products violated the First Amendment. The court ruled, however, that the point-of-sale advertising regulations requiring that indoor advertising be placed no lower than five feet from the floor were invalid because the Attorney General had not provided sufficient justification for that restriction. The First Circuit affirmed the District Court's rulings that the cigarette advertising regulations are not pre-empted by the FCLAA and that the outdoor advertising regulations and the sales practices regulations do not violate the First Amendment under  Central Hudson Gas  &  Elec. Corp.  v.  Public Servo Comm'n of N.  Y.,  447 U. S. 557 , but reversed the lower court's invalidation of the point-of-sale advertising regulations, concluding that the Attorney General is better suited than courts to determine what restrictions are necessary. Held: 1. The FCLAA pre-empts Massachusetts' regulations governing outdoor and point-of-sale cigarette advertising. Pp. 540-553. *Together with No. 00-597, Altadis U. S. A. Inc., as Successor to Consolidated Cigar Corp. and Havatampa, Inc., et al. v. Reilly, Attorney General of Massachusetts, et al., also on certiorari to the same court. 526 Syllabus (a) The FCLAA's pre-emption provision, § 1334, prohibits (a) requiring cigarette packages to bear any ""statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by"" § 1333, and (b) any ""requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health ... imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with"" § 1333. The Court's analysis begins with the statute's language.  Hughes Aircraft Co.  v.  Jacobson,  525 U. S. 432 , 438. The statute's interpretation is aided by considering the predecessor pre-emption provision and the context in which the current language was adopted. See,  e. g., Medtronic, Inc.  v.  Lohr,  518 U. S. 470 , 486. The original provision simply prohibited any ""statement relating to smoking and health ... in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the [Act's] provisions."" Without question, the current pre-emption provision's plain language is much broader.  Cipollone  v.  Liggett Group, Inc.,  505 U. S. 504 , 520. Rather than preventing only ""statements,"" the amended provision reaches all ""requirement[s] or prohibition[s] ... imposed under State law."" And, although the former statute reached only statements ""in the advertising,"" the current provision governs ""with respect to the advertising or promotion"" of cigarettes. At the same time that Congress expanded the pre-emption provision with respect to the States, it enacted a provision prohibiting cigarette advertising in electronic media altogether. Pp. 540-546. (b) Congress pre-empted state cigarette advertising regulations like the Attorney General's because they would upset federal legislative choices to require specific warnings and to impose the ban on cigarette advertising in electronic media in order to address concerns about smoking and health. In holding that the FCLAA does not nullify the Massachusetts regulations, the First Circuit concentrated on whether they are ""with respect to"" advertising and promotion, concluding that the FCLAA only pre-empts regulations of the content of cigarette advertising. The court also reasoned that the regulations are a form of zoning, a traditional area of state power, and, therefore, a presumption against pre-emption applied, see  California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement  v.  Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc.,  519 U. S. 316 , 325. This Court rejects the notion that the regulations are not ""with respect to"" cigarette advertising and promotion. There is no question about an indirect relationship between the Massachusetts regulations and cigarette advertising: The regulations expressly target such advertising.  Id.,  at 324-325. The Attorney General's argument that the regulations are not ""based on smoking and health"" since they do not involve healthrelated content, but instead target youth exposure to cigarette advertising, is unpersuasive because, at bottom, the youth exposure concern is 527 intertwined with the smoking and health concern. Also unavailing is the Attorney General's claim that the regulations are not pre-empted because they govern the location, not the content, of cigarette advertising. The content/location distinction cannot be squared with the preemption provision's language, which reaches  all  ""requirements"" and ""prohibitions"" ""imposed under State law."" A distinction between advertising content and location in the FCLAA also cannot be reconciled with Congress' own location-based restriction, which bans advertising in electronic media, but not elsewhere. The Attorney General's assertion that a complete state ban on cigarette advertising would not be pre-empted because Congress did not intend to preclude local control of zoning finds no support in the FCLAA, whose comprehensive warnings, advertising restrictions, and pre-emption provision would make little sense if a State or locality could simply target and ban all cigarette advertising. Pp. 546-551. (c) The FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not restrict States' and localities' ability to enact generally applicable zoning restrictions on the location and size of advertisements that apply to cigarettes on equal terms with other products, see,  e. g., Metromedia, Inc.  v.  San Diego, 453  U. S. 490, 507-508, or to regulate conduct as it relates to the sale or use of cigarettes, as by prohibiting cigarette sales to minors, see 42 U. S. C. §§ 300x-26(a)(1), 300x-21, as well as common inchoate offenses that attach to criminal conduct, such as solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt, cf.  Central Hudson, supra,  at 563-564. pp. 551-552. (d) Because the issue was not decided below, the Court declines to reach the smokeless tobacco petitioners' argument that, if the outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations for cigarettes are preempted, then the same regulations for smokeless tobacco must be invalidated because they cannot be severed from the cigarette provisions. P.553. 2. Massachusetts' outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations relating to smokeless tobacco and cigars violate the First Amendment, but the sales practices regulations relating to all three tobacco products are constitutional. Pp. 553-571. (a) Under  Central Hudson's  four-part test for analyzing regulations of commercial speech, the Court must determine (1) whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment, (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial, (3) whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and (4) whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest. 447 U. S., at 566. Only the last two steps are at issue here. The Attorney General has assumed for summary judgment purposes that the First Amendment protects the speech of petitioners, none of whom contests 528 Syllabus the importance of the State's interest in preventing the use of tobacco by minors. The third step of  Central Hudson  requires that the government demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.  Edenfield  v.  Fane,  507 U. S. 761 , 770-771. The fourth step of  Central Hudson  requires a reasonable fit between the legislature's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends, a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.  E. g., Florida Bar  v.  Went For It, Inc.,  515 U. S. 618 , 632. Pp. 553-556. (b) The outdoor advertising regulations prohibiting smokeless tobacco or cigar advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground violate the First Amendment. Pp. 556-566. (1) Those regulations satisfy  Central Hudson's  third step by directly advancing the governmental interest asserted to justify them. The Court's detailed review of the record reveals that the Attorney General has provided ample documentation of the problem with underage use of smokeless tobacco and cigars. In addition, the Court disagrees with petitioners' claim that there is no evidence that preventing targeted advertising campaigns and limiting youth exposure to advertising will decrease underage use of those products. On the record below and in the posture of summary judgment, it cannot be concluded that the Attorney General's decision to regulate smokeless tobacco and cigar advertising in an effort to combat the use of tobacco products by minors was based on mere ""speculation and conjecture.""  Edenfield, supra,  at 770. Pp. 556-561. (2) Whatever the strength of the Attorney General's evidence to justify the outdoor advertising regulations, however, the regulations do not satisfy  Central Hudson's  fourth step. Their broad sweep indicates that the Attorney General did not ""carefully calculat[e] the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed.""  Cincinnati  v.  Discovery Network, Inc.,  507 U. S. 410 , 417. The record indicates that the regulations prohibit advertising in a substantial portion of Massachusetts' major metropolitan areas; in some areas, they would constitute nearly a complete ban on the communication of truthful information. This substantial geographical reach is compounded by other factors. ""Outdoor"" advertising includes not only advertising located outside an establishment, but also advertising inside a store if visible from outside. Moreover, the regulations restrict advertisements of any size, and the term advertisement also includes oral statements. The uniformly broad sweep of the geographical limitation and the range of communications restricted demonstrate a lack of tailoring. The governmental interest in preventing underage tobacco use is substantial, and even compelling, but it is no less true that the sale and use of tobacco products by 529 adults is a legal activity. A speech regulation cannot unduly impinge on the speaker's ability to propose a commercial transaction and the adult listener's opportunity to obtain information about products. The Attorney General has failed to show that the regulations at issue are not more extensive than necessary. Pp.561-566. (c) The regulations prohibiting indoor, point-of-sale advertising of smokeless tobacco and cigars lower than 5 feet from the floor of a retail establishment located within 1,000 feet of a school or playground fail both the third and fourth steps of the  Central Hudson  analysis. The 5-foot rule does not seem to advance the goals of preventing minors from using tobacco products and curbing demand for that activity by limiting youth exposure to advertising. Not all children are less than 5 feet tall, and those who are can look up and take in their surroundings. Nor can the blanket height restriction be construed as a mere regulation of communicative action under  United States  v.  O'Brien,  391 U. S. 367 , since it is not unrelated to expression, see,  e. g., Texas  v.  Johnson, 491  U. S. 397,403, but attempts to regulate directly the communicative impact of indoor advertising. Moreover, the restriction does not constitute a reasonable fit with the goal of targeting tobacco advertising that entices children. Although the First Circuit decided that the restriction's burden on speech is very limited, there is no  de minimis  exception for a speech restriction that lacks sufficient tailoring or justification. Pp.566-567. (d) Assuming that petitioners have a cognizable speech interest in a particular means of displaying their products, cf.  Cincinnati  v.  Discovery Network, Inc., supra,  at 410, the regulations requiring retailers to place tobacco products behind counters and requiring customers to have contact with a salesperson before they are able to handle such a product withstand First Amendment scrutiny. The State has demonstrated a substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors and has adopted an appropriately narrow means of advancing that interest. See,  e. g., O'Brien, supra,  at 382. Because unattended displays of such products present an opportunity for access without the proper age verification required by law, the State prohibits self-service and other displays that would allow an individual to obtain tobacco without direct contact with a salesperson. It is clear that the regulations leave open ample communication channels. They do not significantly impede adult access to tobacco products, and retailers have other means of exercising any cognizable speech interest in the presentation of their products. The Court presumes that vendors may place empty tobacco packaging on open display, and display actual tobacco products so long as that display is only accessible to sales personnel. As for cigars, there is no indication that a customer is unable to examine a cigar prior to pur- 530 Syllabus chase, so long as that examination takes place through a salesperson. Pp. 567-570. (e) The Court declines to address the cigar petitioners' First Amendment challenge to a regulation prohibiting sampling or promotional giveaways of cigars and little cigars. That claim was not sufficiently briefed and argued before this Court. Pp. 570-571. 218 F.3d 30 , affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT No. 00-1249. Argued December 3, 200l-Decided January 15,2002 Respondent Chicago Park District adopted an ordinance requiring individuals to obtain a permit before conducting large-scale events in public parks. The ordinance provides that the Park District may deny a permit on any of 13 specified grounds, must process applications within 28 days, and must explain its reasons for a denial. An unsuccessful applicant may appeal, first, to the Park District's general superintendent and then to state court. Petitioners, dissatisfied that the Park District has denied some, though not all, of their applications for permits to hold rallies advocating the legalization of marijuana, filed a 42 U. S. C. § 1983 suit, alleging, inter alia, that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. The District Court granted the Park District summary judgment, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed. Held: 1. A content-neutral permit scheme regulating uses (including speech uses) of a public forum need not contain the procedural safeguards described in Freedman v. Maryland,  380 U. S. 51 . Freedman is inapposite because, unlike the motion picture censorship scheme in that case, the Park District's ordinance is not subject-matter censorship but content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of a public forum. None of the grounds for denying a permit has anything to do with the content of speech. Indeed, the ordinance is not directed at communicative activity as such, but to all activity in a public park. And its object is not to exclude particular communication, but to coordinate multiple uses oflimited space; assure preservation of park facilities; prevent dangerous, unlawful, or impermissible uses; and assure financial accountability for damage caused by an event. pp. 320-323. 2. A content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation can be applied in such a manner as to stifle free expression. It thus must contain adequate standards to guide an official's decision and render that decision subject to effective judicial review. See Niemotko v. Maryland,  340 U. S. 268 , 271. The Park District's ordinance meets this test. That the ordinance describes grounds on which the Park District ""may"" deny a permit does not mean that it allows the Park District to waive requirements for some favored speakers. Such a waiver would be unconstitutional, but this abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern 317 of unlawful favoritism appears, rather than by insisting upon a rigid, no-waiver application of the permit requirements. Pp. 323-325. 3. Because the Park District's ordinance is not subject to Freedman's procedural requirements, this Court does not reach the question whether the requirement of prompt judicial review means a prompt judicial determination or the prompt commencement of judicial proceedings. pp. 325-326. 227 F.3d 921 , affirmed. SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Richard L. Wilson argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Wayne B. Giampietro and Michael David A.

FREE SPEECH COALITION ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT 
No. 00-795. Argued October 30, 200l-Decided April 16, 2002 The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) expands the federal prohibition on child pornography to include not only pornographic images made using actual children, 18 U. S. C. § 2256(8)(A), but also ""any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture,"" that ""is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,"" § 2256(8)(B), and any sexually explicit image that is ""advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression"" it depicts ""a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,"" § 2256(8)(D). Thus, § 2256(8)(B) bans a range of sexually explicit images, sometimes called ""virtual child pornography,"" that appear to depict minors but were produced by means other than using real children, such as through the use of youthful-looking adults or computer-imaging technology. Section 2256(8)(D) is aimed at preventing the production or distribution of pornographic material pandered as child pornography. Fearing that the CPPA threatened their activities, respondents, an adult-entertainment trade association and others, filed this suit alleging that the ""appears to be"" and ""conveys the impression"" provisions are overbroad and vague, chilling production of works protected by the First Amendment. The District Court disagreed and granted the Government summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Generally, pornography can be banned only if it is obscene under  Miller  v.  California,  413 U. S. 15 , but pornography depicting actual children can be proscribed whether or not the images are obscene because of the State's interest in protecting the children exploited by the production process,  New York  v.  Ferber,  458 U. S. 747 , 758, and in prosecuting those who promote such sexual exploitation,  id.,  at 761. The Ninth Circuit held the CPPA invalid on its face, finding it to be substantially overbroad because it bans materials that are neither obscene under  Miller  nor produced by the exploitation of real children as in  Ferber. Held:  The prohibitions of § § 2256(8)(B) and 2256(8)(D) are overbroad and unconstitutional. Pp. 244-258. (a) Section 2256(8)(B) covers materials beyond the categories recognized in  Ferber  and  Miller,  and the reasons the Government offers in 235 support of limiting the freedom of speech have no justification in this Court's precedents or First Amendment law. Pp. 244-256. (1) The CPPA is inconsistent with  Miller.  It extends to images that are not obscene under the  Miller  standard, which requires the Government to prove that the work in question, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive in light of community standards, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, 413 U. S., at 24. Materials need not appeal to the prurient interest under the CPPA, which proscribes any depiction of sexually explicit activity, no matter how it is presented. It is not necessary, moreover, that the image be patently offensive. Pictures of what appear to be 17-year-olds engaging in sexually explicit activity do not in every case contravene community standards. The CPPA also prohibits speech having serious redeeming value, proscribing the visual depiction of an idea-that of teenagers engaging in sexual activity-that is a fact of modern society and has been a theme in art and literature for centuries. A number of acclaimed movies, filmed without any child actors, explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions. If those movies contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within the statutory definition, their possessor would be subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the literary value of the work. This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: A work's artistic merit does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See,  e. g., Book Named ""John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure""  v.  Attorney General of Mass.,  383 U. S. 413 , 419. Under  Miller,  redeeming value is judged by considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become obscene, even though the scene in isolation might be offensive. See  Kois  v.  Wisconsin,  408 U. S. 229 , 231  (per curiam).  The CPPA cannot be read to prohibit obscenity, because it lacks the required link between its prohibitions and the affront to community standards prohibited by the obscenity definition. Pp. 244-249. (2) The CPPA finds no support in  Ferber.  The Court rejects the Government's argument that speech prohibited by the CPPA is virtually indistinguishable from material that may be banned under  Ferber.  That case upheld a prohibition on the distribution and sale of child pornography, as well as its production, because these acts were ""intrinsically related"" to the sexual abuse of children in two ways. 458 U. S., at 759. First, as a permanent record of a child's abuse, the continued circulation itself would harm the child who had participated. See  id.,  at 759, and n. 10. Second, because the traffic in child pornography was an economic motive for its production, the State had an interest in closing the distribution network.  Id.,  at 760. Under 236 either rationale, the speech had what the Court in effect held was a proximate link to the crime from which it came. In contrast to the speech in  Ferber,  speech that is itself the record of sexual abuse, the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production. Virtual child pornography is not ""intrinsically related"" to the sexual abuse of children. While the Government asserts that the images can lead to actual instances of child abuse, the causal link is contingent and indirect. The harm does not necessarily follow from the speech, but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts. The Government's argument that these indirect harms are sufficient because, as  Ferber  acknowledged, child pornography rarely can be valuable speech, see  id.,  at 762, suffers from two flaws. First,  Ferber's  judgment about child pornography was based upon how it was made, not on what it communicated. The case reaffirmed that where the speech is neither obscene nor the product of sexual abuse, it does not fall outside the First Amendment's protection. See  id.,  at 764-765. Second,  Ferber  did not hold that child pornography is by definition without value. It recognized some works in this category might have significant value, see  id.,  at 761, but relied on virtual images-the very images prohibited by the CPPA-as an alternative and permissible means of expression,  id.,  at 763. Because  Ferber  relied on the distinction between actual and virtual child pornography as supporting its holding, it provides no support for a statute that eliminates the distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as well. Pp.249-251. (3) The Court rejects other arguments offered by the Government to justify the CPPA's prohibitions. The contention that the CPPA is necessary because pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children runs afoul of the principle that speech within the rights of adults to hear may not be silenced completely in an attempt to shield children from it. See,  e. g., Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.  v.  FCC,  492 U. S. 115 , 130-131. That the evil in question depends upon the actor's unlawful conduct, defined as criminal quite apart from any link to the speech in question, establishes that the speech ban is not narrowly drawn. The argument that virtual child pornography whets pedophiles' appetites and encourages them to engage in illegal conduct is unavailing because the mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it,  Stanley  v.  Georgia,  394 U. S. 557 , 566, absent some showing of a direct connection between the speech and imminent illegal conduct, see,  e. g., Brandenburg  v.  Ohio,  395 U. S. 444 , 447  (per curiam).  The argument that eliminating the market for pornography produced using real children necessitates a prohibition on virtual images as well is somewhat implausible because 237 few pornographers would risk prosecution for abusing real children if fictional, computerized images would suffice. Moreover, even if the market deterrence theory were persuasive, the argument cannot justify the CPPA because, here, there is no underlying crime at all. Finally, the First Amendment is turned upside down by the argument that, because it is difficult to distinguish between images made using real children and those produced by computer imaging, both kinds of images must be prohibited. The overbreadth doctrine prohibits the Government from banning unprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech is prohibited or chilled in the process. See  Broadrick  v.  Oklahoma,  413 U. S. 601 , 612. The Government's rejoinder that the CPPA should be read not as a prohibition on speech but as a measure shifting the burden to the accused to prove the speech is lawful raises serious constitutional difficulties. The Government misplaces its reliance on § 2252A(c), which creates an affirmative defense allowing a defendant to avoid conviction for nonpossession offenses by showing that the materials were produced using only adults and were not otherwise distributed in a manner conveying the impression that they depicted real children. Even if an affirmative defense can save a statute from First Amendment challenge, here the defense is insufficient because it does not apply to possession or to images created by computer imaging, even where the defendant could demonstrate no children were harmed in producing the images. Thus, the defense leaves unprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government's interest in distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones. Pp.251-256. (b) Section 2256(8)(D) is also substantially overbroad. The Court disagrees with the Government's view that the only difference between that provision and § 2256(8)(B)'s ""appears to be"" provision is that § 2256(8)(D) requires the jury to assess the material at issue in light of the manner in which it is promoted, but that the determination would still depend principally upon the prohibited work's content. The ""conveys the impression"" provision requires little judgment about the image's content; the work must be sexually explicit, but otherwise the content is irrelevant. Even if a film contains no sexually explicit scenes involving minors, it could be treated as child pornography if the title and trailers convey the impression that such scenes will be found in the movie. The determination turns on how the speech is presented, not on what is depicted. The Government's other arguments in support of the CPPA do not bear on §2256(8)(D). The materials, for instance, are not likely to be confused for child pornography in a criminal trial. Pandering may be relevant, as an evidentiary matter, to the question whether particular materials are obscene. See  Ginzburg  v.  United 238 States,  383 U. S. 463 , 474. Where a defendant engages in the ""commercial exploitation"" of erotica solely for the sake of prurient appeal,  id.,  at 466, the context created may be relevant to evaluating whether the materials are obscene. Section 2256(8)(D), however, prohibits a substantial amount of speech that falls outside  Ginzburg's  rationale. Proscribed material is tainted and unlawful in the hands of all who receive it, though they bear no responsibility for how it was marketed, sold, or described. The statute, furthermore, does not require that the context be part of an effort at ""commercial exploitation."" Thus, the CPPA does more than prohibit pandering. It bans possession of material pandered as child pornography by someone earlier in the distribution chain, as well as a sexually explicit film that contains no youthful actors but has been packaged to suggest a prohibited movie. Possession is a crime even when the possessor knows the movie was mislabeled. The First Amendment requires a more precise restriction. Pp. 257-258.

WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT No. 01-344. Argued February 26, 2002-Decided April 29, 2002 Drug compounding is a process by which a pharmacist or doctor combines, mixes, or alters ingredients to create a medication tailored to an individual patient's needs. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) exempts ""compounded drugs"" from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) standard drug approval requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), so long as the providers of the compounded drugs abide by several restrictions, including that the prescription be ""unsolicited,"" 21 U. S. C. § 353a(a), and that the providers ""not advertise or promote the compounding of any particular drug, class of drug, or type of drug,"" § 353a(c). Respondents, a group of licensed pharmacies that specialize in compounding drugs, sought to enjoin enforcement of the advertising and solicitation provisions, arguing that they violate the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. The District Court agreed and granted respondents summary judgment, holding that the provisions constitute unconstitutional restrictions on commercial speech under  Central Hudson Gas  &  Elec. Corp.  v.  Public Servo Comm'n of N.  Y.,  447 U. S. 557 , 566. Affirming in relevant part, the Ninth Circuit held that the restrictions in question fail  Central Hudson's  test because the Government had not demonstrated that the restrictions would directly advance its interests or that alternatives less restrictive of speech were unavailable. Held:  The FDAMA's prohibitions on soliciting prescriptions for, and advertising, compounded drugs amount to unconstitutional restrictions on commercial speech. Pp. 366-377. (a) For a commercial speech regulation to be constitutionally permissible under the  Central Hudson  test, the speech in question must concern lawful activity and not be misleading, the asserted governmental interest to be served by the regulation must be substantial, and the regulation must ""directly advanc[e]"" the governmental interest and ""not [be] more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest,"" 447 U. S., at 566. Pp. 366-368. (b) The Government asserts that three substantial interests underlie the FDAMA: (1) preserving the effectiveness and integrity of the 358 358 THOMPSON  v.  WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER 
Syllabus FDCA's new drug approval process and the protection of the public health it provides; (2) preserving the availability of compounded drugs for patients who, for particularized medical reasons, cannot use commercially available products approved by the FDA; and (3) achieving the proper balance between those two competing interests. Preserving the new drug approval process is clearly an important governmental interest, as is permitting the continuation of the practice of compounding so that patients with particular needs may obtain medications suited to those needs. Because pharmacists do not make enough money from small-scale compounding to make safety and efficacy testing of their compounded drugs economically feasible, however, it would not make sense to require compounded drugs created to meet the unique needs of individual patients to undergo the entire new drug approval process. The Government therefore needs to be able to draw a line between small-scale compounding and large-scale drug manufacturing. The Government argues that the FDAMA's speech-related provisions provide just such a line: As long as pharmacists do not advertise particular compounded drugs, they may sell compounded drugs without first undergoing safety and efficacy testing and obtaining FDA approval. However, even assuming that the FDAMA's prohibition on advertising compounded drugs ""directly advance[s]"" the Government's asserted interests, the Government has failed to demonstrate that the speech restrictions are ""not more extensive than is necessary to serve [those] interest[s].""  Central Hudson, supra,  at 566. If the Government can achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict commercial speech, or that restricts less speech, the Government must do so.  E. g., Rubin  v.  Coors Brewing Co.,  514 U. S. 476 , 490-491. Several non-speech-related means of drawing a line between compounding and large-scale manufacturing might be possible here. For example, the Government could ban the use of commercial scale manufacturing or testing equipment in compounding drug products, prohibit pharmacists from compounding more drugs in anticipation of receiving prescriptions than in response to prescriptions already received, or prohibit them from offering compounded drugs at wholesale to other state licensed persons or commercial entities for resale. The Government has not offered any reason why such possibilities, alone or in combination, would be insufficient to prevent compounding from occurring on such a scale as to undermine the new drug approval process. Pp. 368-373. (c) Even if the Government had argued (as does the dissent) that the FDAMA's speech-related restrictions were motivated by a fear that advertising compounded drugs would put people who do not need such drugs at risk by causing them to convince their doctors to prescribe the drugs anyway, that fear would fail to justify the restrictions. This 359 concern rests on the questionable assumption that doctors would prescribe unnecessary medications and amounts to a fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information, a notion that the Court rejected as a justification for an advertising ban in,  e. g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy  v.  Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,  425 U. S. 748 ,770. Pp. 373-376. (d) If the Government's failure to justify its decision to regulate speech were not enough to convince the Court that the FDAMA's advertising provisions were unconstitutional, the amount of beneficial speech prohibited by the FDAMA would be. Forbidding the advertisement of compounded drugs would prevent pharmacists with no interest in mass-producing medications, but who serve clienteles with special medical needs, from telling the doctors treating those clients about the alternative drugs available through compounding. For example, a pharmacist serving a children's hospital where many patients are unable to swallow pills would be prevented from telling the children's doctors about a new development in compounding that allowed a drug that was previously available only in pill form to be administered another way. The fact that the FDAMA would prohibit such seemingly useful speech even though doing so does not appear to directly further any asserted governmental objective confirms that the prohibition is unconstitutional.

No. 00-799. Argued December 4, 200l-Decided May 13,2002 Based on its 1977 study concluding that concentrations of adult entertainment establishments are associated with higher crime rates in surrounding communities, petitioner city enacted an ordinance prohibiting such enterprises within 1,000 feet of each other or within 500 feet of a religious institution, school, or public park. Los Angeles Municipal Code §  12.70(C)  (1978). Because the ordinance's method of calculating distances created a loophole permitting the concentration of multiple adult enterprises in a single structure, the city later amended the ordinance to prohibit ""more than one adult entertainment business in the same building."" §  12.70(C)  (1983). Respondents, two adult establishments that openly operate combined bookstores/video arcades in violation of §  12.70(C),  as amended, sued under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance, on its face, violates the First Amendment. Finding that the ordinance was not a content-neutral regulation of speech, the District Court reasoned that neither the 1977 study nor a report cited in  Hart Book Stores  v.  Edmisten,  a Fourth Circuit case upholding a similar statute, supported a reasonable belief that multiple-use adult establishments produce the secondary effects the city asserted as content-neutral justifications for its prohibition. Subjecting §  12.70(C)  to strict scrutiny, the court granted respondents summary judgment because it felt the city had not offered evidence demonstrating that its prohibition was necessary to serve a compelling government interest. The Ninth Circuit affirmed on the different ground that, even if the ordinance were content neutral, the city failed to present evidence upon which it could reasonably rely to demonstrate that its regulation of multiple-use establishments was designed to serve its substantial interest in reducing crime. The court therefore held the ordinance invalid under  Renton  v.  Playtime Theatres, Inc.,  475 U. S. 41 . Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  222 F.3d 719 , reversed and remanded."

AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT No. 00-1293. Argued November 28, 200l-Decided May 13,2002 In  Reno  v.  American Civil Liberties Union,  521 U. S. 844 , this Court found that the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA)-Congress' first attempt to protect children from exposure to pornographic material on the Internet-ran afoul of the First Amendment in its regulation of indecent transmissions and the display of patently offensive material. That conclusion was based, in part, on the crucial consideration that the CDA's breadth was wholly unprecedented. After the Court's decision in  Reno,  Congress attempted to address this concern in the Child Online Protection Act (COPA). Unlike the CDA, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web, covers only communications made for commercial purposes, and restricts only ""material that is harmful to minors,"" 47 U. S. C. § 231(a)(I). In defining ""material that is harmful to minors,"" COPA draws on the three-part obscenity test set forth in  Miller  v.  California,  413 U. S. 15 , see § 231(e)(6), and thus requires jurors to apply ""contemporary community standards"" in assessing material, see §231(e)(6)(A). Respondents-who post or have members that post sexually oriented material on the Web-filed a facial challenge before COPA went into effect, claiming,  inter alia,  that the statute violated adults' First Amendment rights because it effectively banned constitutionally protected speech, was not the least restrictive means of accomplishing a compelling governmental purpose, and was substantially overbroad. The District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of COPA because it concluded that the statute was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny. The Third Circuit affirmed but based its decision on a ground not relied upon by the District Court: that COPA's use of ""contemporary community standards,"" § 231(e)(6)(A), to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute substantially overbroad. Held:  COPA's reliance on ""community standards"" to identify what material ""is harmful to minors"" does not by itself render the statute substantially overbroad for First Amendment purposes. The Court, however, expresses no view as to whether COPA suffers from substantial overbreadth for reasons other than its use of community standards, whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague, or whether the statute survives 565 strict scrutiny. Prudence dictates allowing the Third Circuit to first examine these difficult issues. Because petitioner did not ask to have the preliminary injunction vacated, and because this Court could not do so without addressing matters the Third Circuit has yet to consider, the Government remains enjoined from enforcing COPA absent further action by the lower courts.

VILLAGE OF STRATTON ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT No. 00-1737. Argued February 26, 2002-Decided June 17,2002 Respondent Village of Stratton (Village) promulgated an ordinance that,  inter alia,  prohibits ""canvassers"" from ""going in and upon"" private residential property to promote any ""cause"" without first obtaining a permit from the mayor's office by completing and signing a registration form. Petitioners, a society and a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses that publish and distribute religious materials, brought this action for injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance violates their First Amendment rights to the free exercise of religion, free speech, and freedom of the press. The District Court upheld most provisions of the ordinance as valid, content-neutral regulations, although it did require the Village to accept narrowing constructions of several provisions. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. Among its rulings, that court held that the ordinance was content neutral and of general applicability and therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny; rejected petitioners' argument that the ordinance is overbroad because it impairs the right to distribute pamphlets anonymously that was recognized in  McIntyre  v.  Ohio Elections Comm'n,  514 U. S. 334 ; concluded that the Village's interests in protecting its residents from fraud and undue annoyance and its desire to prevent criminals from posing as canvassers in order to defraud its residents were sufficient bases on which to justify the regulation; and distinguished this Court's earlier cases protecting the Jehovah's Witnesses ministry. Held:  The ordinance's provisions making it a misdemeanor to engage in door-to-door advocacy without first registering with the mayor and receiving a permit violate the First Amendment as it applies to religious proselytizing, anonymous political speech, and the distribution of handbills. Pp. 160-169. (a) For over 50 years, this Court has invalidated on First Amendment grounds restrictions on door-to-door canvassing and pamphleteering by Jehovah's Witnesses. See,  e.  g.,  Murdock  v.  Pennsylvania,  319 U. S. 105 . Although those cases do not directly control the question at issue, they yield several themes that guide the Court. Among other things, 151 those cases emphasize that the hand distribution of religious tracts is ages old and has the same claim as more orthodox practices to the guarantees of freedom of religion, speech, and press,  e.  g.,  id., at 109; discuss extensively the historical importance of door-to-door canvassing and pamphleteering as vehicles for the dissemination of ideas,  e. g., Schneider  v.  State (Town of Irvington),  308 U. S. 147 , 164, but recognize the legitimate interests a town may have in some form of regulation, particularly when the solicitation of money is involved,  e. g., Cantwell  v.  Connecticut,  310 U. S. 296 , 306, or the prevention of burglary is a legitimate concern,  Martin  v.  City of Struthers,  319 U. S. 141 , 144; make clear that there must be a balance between such interests and the effect of the regulations on First Amendment rights,  e. g., ibid.;  and demonstrate that the Jehovah's Witnesses have not struggled for their rights alone, but for those many who are poorly financed and rely extensively upon this method of communication, see,  e.  g.,  id., at 144-146, including nonreligious groups and individuals, see,  e. g., Thomas  v.  Collins,  323 U. S. 516 ,539-540. Pp. 160-164. (b) The Court need not resolve the parties' dispute as to what standard of review to use here because the breadth of speech affected by the ordinance and the nature of the regulation make it clear that the Sixth Circuit erred in upholding it. There is no doubt that the interests the ordinance assertedly serves-the prevention of fraud and crime and the protection of residents' privacy-are important and that the Village may seek to safeguard them through some form of regulation of solicitation activity. However, the amount of speech covered by the ordinance raises serious concerns. Had its provisions been construed to apply only to commercial activities and the solicitation of funds, arguably the ordinance would have been tailored to the Village's interest in protecting its residents' privacy and preventing fraud. Yet, the Village's administration of its ordinance unquestionably demonstrates that it applies to a significant number of noncommercial ""canvassers"" promoting a wide variety of ""causes."" The pernicious effect of the permit requirement is illustrated by,  e.  g.,  the requirement that a canvasser be identified in a permit application filed in the mayor's office and made available for public inspection, which necessarily results in a surrender of the anonymity this Court has protected. Also central to the Court's conclusion that the ordinance does not pass First Amendment scrutiny is that it is not tailored to the Village's stated interests. Even if the interest in preventing fraud could adequately support the ordinance insofar as it applies to commercial transactions and the solicitation of funds, that interest provides no support for its application to petitioners, to political campaigns, or to enlisting support for unpopular causes. The Village's 152 152 WATCHTOWER BIBLE & TRACT SOC. OF N. Y., INC.  v. VILLAGE OF STRATTON 
Syllabus argument that the ordinance is nonetheless valid because it serves the two additional interests of protecting residents' privacy and the prevention of crime is unpersuasive. As to the former, an unchallenged ordinance section authorizing residents to post ""No Solicitation"" signs, coupled with their unquestioned right to refuse to engage in conversation with unwelcome visitors, provides ample protection for unwilling listeners. As to the latter, it seems unlikely that the lack of a permit would preclude criminals from knocking on doors and engaging in conversations not covered by the ordinance, and, in any event, there is no evidence in the record of a special crime problem related to door-to-door solicitation.

SIMMONS-HARRIS ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT No.00-1751. Argued February 20, 2002-Decided June 27, 2002* Ohio's Pilot Project Scholarship Program gives educational choices to families in any Ohio school district that is under state control pursuant to a federal-court order. The program provides tuition aid for certain students in the Cleveland City School District, the only covered district, to attend participating public or private schools of their parent's choosing and tutorial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public school. Both religious and nonreligious schools in the district may participate, as may public schools in adjacent school districts. Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial need, and where the aid is spent depends solely upon where parents choose to enroll their children. The number of tutorial assistance grants provided to students remaining in public school must equal the number of tuition aid scholarships. In the 1999-2000 school year, 82% of the participating private schools had a religious affiliation, none of the adjacent public schools participated, and 96% of the students participating in the scholarship program were enrolled in religiously affiliated schools. Sixty percent of the students were from families at or below the poverty line. Cleveland schoolchildren also have the option of enrolling in community schools, which are funded under state law but run by their own school boards and receive twice the per-student funding as participating private schools, or magnet schools, which are public schools emphasizing a particular subject area, teaching method, or service, and for which the school district receives the same amount per student as it does for a student enrolled at a traditional public school. Respondents, Ohio taxpayers, sought to enjoin the program on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause. The Federal District Court granted them summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Held:  The program does not offend the Establishment Clause. Pp. 648-663. *Together with No. 00-1777, Hanna Perkins School et al. v. SimmonsHarris et al., and No. 00-1779, Taylor et al. v. Simmons-Harris et al., also on certiorari to the same court. 640 Syllabus (a) Because the program was enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to poor children in a demonstrably failing public school system, the question is whether the program nonetheless has the forbidden effect of advancing or inhibiting religion. See  Agostini  v.  Felton,  521 U. S. 203 , 222-223. This Court's jurisprudence makes clear that a government aid program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause if it is neutral with respect to religion and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice. See,  e.  g.,  Mueller  v.  Allen,  463 U. S. 388 . Under such a program, government aid reaches religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients. The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual aid recipients, not the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits. Pp. 648-653. (b) The instant program is one of true private choice, consistent with the  Mueller  line of cases, and thus constitutional. It is neutral in all respects toward religion, and is part of Ohio's general and multifaceted undertaking to provide educational opportunities to children in a failed school district. It confers educational assistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined without reference to religion and permits participation of all district schools-religious or nonreligious-and adjacent public schools. The only preference in the program is for lowincome families, who receive greater assistance and have priority for admission. Rather than creating financial incentives that skew it toward religious schools, the program creates financial disincentives: Private schools receive only half the government assistance given to community schools and one-third that given to magnet schools, and adjacent public schools would receive two to three times that given to private schools. Families too have a financial disincentive, for they have to copay a portion of private school tuition, but pay nothing at a community, magnet, or traditional public school. No reasonable observer would think that such a neutral private choice program carries with it the  imprimatur  of government endorsement. Nor is there evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular educational options: Their children may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose to attend a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose to attend a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school. The Establishment Clause question whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools must be answered by evaluating  all  options 641 Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a scholarship and then choose a religious school. Cleveland's preponderance of religiously affiliated schools did not result from the program, but is a phenomenon common to many American cities. Eighty-two percent of Cleveland's private schools are religious, as are 81% of Ohio's private schools. To attribute constitutional significance to the 82% figure would lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in parts of Ohio where the percentage is lower, but not in Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs most sorely needed. Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional only in States with a lower percentage of religious private schools. Respondents' additional argument that constitutional significance should be attached to the fact that 96% of the scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools was flatly rejected in  Mueller.  The constitutionality of a neutral educational aid program simply does not turn on whether and why, in a particular area, at a particular time, most private schools are religious, or most recipients choose to use the aid at a religious school. Finally, contrary to respondents' argument,  Committee for Public Ed.  &  Religious Liberty  v.  Nyquist,  413 U. S. 756 -a case that expressly reserved judgment on the sort of program challenged here-does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that offer aid directly to a broad class of individuals defined without regard to religion. pp. 653-663. 234 F.3d 945 , reversed.

WHITE, CHAIRPERSON, MINNESOTA BOARD OF JUDICIAL STANDARDS, ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT 
No.01-521. Argued March 26, 2002-Decided June 27, 2002 The Minnesota Supreme Court has adopted a canon of judicial conduct that prohibits a ""candidate for a judicial office"" from ""announc[ing] his or her views on disputed legal or political issues"" (hereinafter announce clause). While running for associate justice of that court, petitioner Gregory Wersal (and others) filed this suit seeking a declaration that the announce clause violates the First Amendment and an injunction against its enforcement. The District Court granted respondent officials summary judgment, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed. Held:  The announce clause violates the First Amendment. Pp. 770-788. (a) The record demonstrates that the announce clause prohibits a judicial candidate from stating his views on any specific nonfancifullegal question within the province of the court for which he is running, except in the context of discussing past decisions-and in the latter context as well, if he expresses the view that he is not bound by  stare decisis.  Pp. 770-774. (b) The announce clause both prohibits speech based on its content and burdens a category of speech that is at the core of First Amendment freedoms-speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office. The Eighth Circuit concluded, and the parties do not dispute, that the proper test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of such a restriction is strict scrutiny, under which respondents have the burden to prove that the clause is (1) narrowly tailored, to serve (2) a compelling state interest.  E.  g.,  Eu  v.  San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm.,  489 U. S. 214 , 222. That court found that respondents had established two interests as sufficiently compelling to justify the announce clause: preserving the state judiciary's impartiality and preserving the appearance of that impartiality. Pp. 774-775. (c) Under any definition of ""impartiality,"" the announce clause fails strict scrutiny. First, it is plain that the clause is not narrowly tailored to serve impartiality (or its appearance) in the traditional sense of the word, i.  e.,  as a lack of bias for or against either party to the proceeding. Indeed, the clause is barely tailored to serve that interest at all, inasmuch as it does not restrict speech for or against particular parties, 766 but rather speech for or against particular issues. Second, although ""impartiality"" in the sense of a lack of preconception in favor of or against a particular legal view may well be an interest served by the announce clause, pursuing this objective is not a compelling state interest, since it is virtually impossible, and hardly desirable, to find a judge who does not have preconceptions about the law, see  Laird  v.  Tatum,  409 U. S. 824 , 835. Third, the Court need not decide whether achieving ""impartiality"" (or its appearance) in the sense of openmindedness is a compelling state interest because, as a means of pursuing this interest, the announce clause is so woefully underinclusive that the Court does not believe it was adopted for that purpose. See,  e. g., City of Ladue  v.  Gilleo,  512 U. S. 43 , 52-53. Respondents have not carried the burden imposed by strict scrutiny of establishing that statements made during an election campaign are uniquely destructive of openmindedness. See,  e. g., Landmark Communications, Inc.  v.  Virginia,  435 U. S. 829 , 841. Pp. 775-784. (d) A universal and long-established tradition of prohibiting certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is constitutional, see  McIntyre  v.  Ohio Elections Comm'n,  514 U. S. 334 , 375-377. However, the practice of prohibiting speech by judicial candidates is neither ancient nor universal. The Court knows of no such prohibitions throughout the 19th and the first quarter of the 20th century, and they are still not universally adopted. This does not compare well with the traditions deemed worthy of attention in,  e. g., Burson  v.  Freeman, 504 (e) There is an obvious tension between Minnesota's Constitution, which requires judicial elections, and the announce clause, which places most subjects of interest to the voters off limits. The First Amendment does not permit Minnesota to leave the principle of elections in place while preventing candidates from discussing what the elections are about. See,  e. g., Renne  v.  Geary,  501 U. S. 312 , 349. Pp. 787-788. 247 F.3d 854 , reversed and remanded. SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C.

BLACK ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA No. 01-1107.

When respondent Black objected on First Amendment grounds to his trial court's jury instruction that cross burning by itself is sufficient evidence from which the required ""intent to intimidate"" could be inferred, the prosecutor responded that the instruction was taken straight out of the Virginia Model Instructions. Respondent O'Mara pleaded guilty to charges of violating the statute, but reserved the right to challenge its constitutionality. At respondent Elliott's trial, the judge instructed the jury as to what the Commonwealth had to prove, but did not give an instruction on the meaning of the word ""intimidate,"" nor on the statute's prima facie evidence provision. Consolidating all three cases, the Virginia Supreme Court held that the crossburning statute is unconstitutional on its face; that it is analytically indistinguishable from the ordinance found unconstitutional in  R. A. V. v. St. Paul ,  505 U. S. 377 ; that it discriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint since it selectively chooses only cross burning because of its distinctive message; and that the prima facie evidence provision renders the statute overbroad because the enhanced probability of prosecution under the statute chills the expression of protected speech.

MADIGAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ILLINOIS  v.  TELEMARKETING ASSOCIATES, INC., ET AL. 
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS No. 01-1806. Argued March 3, 2003-Decided May 5, 2003 Respondents, Illinois for-profit fundraising corporations and their owner (collectively Telemarketers), were retained by VietNow National Headquarters, a charitable nonprofit corporation, to solicit donations to aid Vietnam veterans. The contracts between those parties provided, among other things, that Telemarketers would retain 85 percent of the gross receipts from Illinois donors, leaving 15 percent for VietNow. The Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint in state court, alleging,  inter alia,  that Telemarketers represented to donors that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow for specifically identified charitable endeavors, and that such representations were knowingly deceptive and materially false, constituted a fraud, and were made for Telemarketers' private pecuniary benefit. The trial court granted Telemarketers' motion to dismiss the fraud claims on First Amendment grounds. In affirming, the Illinois Appellate and Supreme Courts placed heavy weight on  Schaumburg  v.  Citizens for a Better Environment,  444 U. S. 620 ,  Secretary of State of Md.  v.  Joseph H. Munson Co.,  467 U. S. 947 , and  Riley  v.  National Federation of Blind of  N. C., Inc.,  487 U. S. 781 . Those decisions held that certain regulations of charitable solicitation barring fees in excess of a prescribed level effectively imposed prior restraints on fundraising, and were therefore incompatible with the First Amendment. The state high court acknowledged that this case involved no such prophylactic proscription of high-fee charitable solicitation. Instead, the court noted, the Attorney General sought to enforce the State's generally applicable antifraud laws against Telemarketers for specific instances of deliberate deception. However, the Illinois Supreme Court said, Telemarketers' solicitation statements were alleged to be false only because Telemarketers contracted for 85 percent of the gross receipts and failed to disclose this information to donors. The court concluded that the Attorney General's complaint was, in essence, an attempt to regulate Telemarketers' ability to engage in a protected activity based upon a percentage-rate limitation-the same regulatory principle rejected in  Schaumburg, Munson,  and  Riley. 601 Held:  Consistent with this Court's precedent and the First Amendment, States may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used. The Illinois Attorney General's allegations against Telemarketers therefore state a claim for relief that can survive a motion to dismiss. Pp. 611-624. (a) The First Amendment protects the right to engage in charitable solicitation, see,  e. g., Schaumburg,  444 U. S., at 632, but does not shield fraud, see,  e. g., Donaldson  v.  Read Magazine, Inc.,  333 U. S. 178 , 190. Like other forms of public deception, fraudulent charitable solicitation is unprotected speech. See,  e. g., Schneider  v.  State (Town of Irvington),  308 U. S. 147 , 164. This Court has not previously addressed the First Amendment's application to individual fraud actions of the kind at issue here. It has, however, three times held unconstitutional prophylactic laws designed to combat fraud by imposing prior restraints on solicitation when fundraising fees exceeded a specified reasonable level. Pp. 611-617. (b) In those cases,  Schaumburg, Munson,  and  Riley,  the Court took care to leave a corridor open for fraud actions to guard the public against false or misleading charitable solicitations. See,  e. g., Schaumburg,  444 U. S., at 637. As those decisions recognized, there are differences critical to First Amendment concerns between fraud actions trained on representations made in individual cases and statutes that categorically ban solicitations when fundraising costs run high. Simply labeling an action one for ""fraud,"" of course, will not carry the day. Had the State Attorney General's complaint charged fraud based solely on the percentage of donations the fundraisers would retain, or their failure to alert donors to fee arrangements at the start of each call,  Riley  would support swift dismissal. Portions of the Attorney General's complaint against Telemarketers were of this genre. But the complaint and annexed affidavits, in large part, alleged not simply what Telemarketers failed to convey. They also described what Telemarketers misleadingly represented. Taking into account the affidavits, and reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Attorney General, that pleading described misrepresentations this Court's precedent does not place under the First Amendment's cover. First, the complaint asserted that Telemarketers affirmatively represented that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow to be used for specific charitable purposes while in fact Telemarketers knew that 15 cents or less of each dollar would be available for those purposes. Second, the complaint essentially alleged that the charitable solicitation was a fa\;ade: Although Telemarketers represented that donated funds would go to VietNow's charitable purposes, the amount of funds paid over to 602 
Syllabus the charity was merely incidental to the fundraising effort, which was made for Telemarketers' private pecuniary benefit. Fraud actions so tailored, targeting misleading affirmative representations about how donations would be used, are unlike the prophylactic measures invalidated in  Schaumburg, Munson,  and  Riley:  So long as the emphasis is on what the fundraisers misleadingly convey, and not on percentage limitations on solicitors' fees  per se,  fraud actions need not impermissibly chill protected speech. Pp. 617-619. (c) The prohibitions invalidated in  Schaumburg, Munson,  and  Riley  turned solely on whether high percentages of donated funds were spent on fundraising. Their application did not depend on whether the fundraiser made fraudulent representations to potential donors. In contrast to the prior restraints inspected in those cases, a properly tailored fraud action targeting specific fraudulent representations employs no ""'[b]road prophylactic rul[e],'""  Schaumburg,  444 U. S., at 637 (citation omitted), lacking any ""nexus ... [to] the likelihood that the solicitation is fraudulent,""  Riley,  487 U. S., at 793. Such an action thus falls on the constitutional side of the line ""between regulation aimed at fraud and regulation aimed at something else in the hope that it would sweep fraud in during the process.""  Munson,  467 U. S., at 969-970. The Attorney General's complaint has a solid core in allegations that home in on Telemarketers' affirmative statements designed to mislead donors regarding the use of their contributions. Of prime importance, to prove a defendant liable for fraud under Illinois case law, the State must show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly made a false representation of a material fact, that such representation was made with the intent to mislead the listener, and that the representation succeeded in doing so. In contrast to a prior restraint on solicitation, or a regulation that imposes on fundraisers an uphill burden to prove their conduct lawful, the State bears the full burden of proof in an individualized fraud action. Exacting proof requirements of this order, in other contexts, have been held to provide sufficient breathing room for protected speech. See,  e. g., New York Times Co.  v.  Sullivan,  376 U. S. 254 , 279-280. As an additional safeguard responsive to First Amendment concerns, an appellate court could independently review the trial court's findings. Cf.  Bose Corp.  v.  Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,  466 U. S. 485 , 498-511. What the First Amendment and this Court's case law emphatically do not require, however, is a blanket exemption from fraud liability for a fundraiser who intentionally misleads in calls for donations. While the percentage of fundraising proceeds turned over to a charity is not an accurate measure of the amount of funds used ""for"" a charitable purpose,  Munson,  467 U. S., at 967, n. 16, the gravamen of the fraud action in this case is not high costs or fees, 603 but particular representations made with intent to mislead. The Illinois Attorney General has not suggested that a charity must desist from using donations for legitimate purposes such as information dissemination, advocacy, and the like. Rather, the Attorney General has alleged that Telemarketers attracted donations by misleading potential donors into believing that a substantial portion of their contributions would fund specific programs or services, knowing full well that was not the case. Such representations remain false or misleading, however legitimate the other purposes for which the funds are in fact used. The Court does not agree with Telemarketers that the Attorney General's fraud action is simply an end run around  Riley's  holding that fundraisers may not be required, in every telephone solicitation, to state the percentage of receipts the fundraiser would retain. It is one thing to compel every fundraiser to disclose its fee arrangements at the start of a telephone conversation, quite another to take fee arrangements into account in assessing whether particular affirmative representations designedly deceive the public. Pp. 619-623. (d) Given this Court's repeated approval of government efforts to enable donors to make informed choices about their charitable contributions, see,  e. g., Schaumburg,  444 U. S., at 638, almost all States and many localities require charities and professional fundraisers to register and file regular reports on their activities, particularly their fundraising costs. These reports are generally available to the public and are often placed on the Internet. Telemarketers do not object on First Amendment grounds to these disclosure requirements. Just as government may seek to inform the public and prevent fraud through such requirements, so it may vigorously enforce antifraud laws to prohibit professional fundraisers from obtaining money on false pretenses or by making false statements.  Riley,  487 U. S., at 800. High fundraising costs, without more, do not establish fraud, see  id.,  at 793, and mere failure to volunteer the fundraiser's fee when contacting a potential donee, without more, is insufficient to state a claim for fraud,  id.,  at 795-801. But these limitations do not disarm States from assuring that their residents are positioned to make informed choices about their charitable giving. Pp. 623-624. 198 Ill. 2d 345, 763 N.

HICKS CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA No.02-371. Argued April 30, 2003-Decided June 16,2003 The Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority (RRHA), a political subdivision of Virginia, owns and operates Whitcomb Court, a lowincome housing development. In 1997, the Richmond City Council conveyed Whitcomb Court's streets to the RRHA in an effort to combat crime and drug dealing by nonresidents. In accordance with the terms of conveyance, the RRHA enacted a policy authorizing the Richmond police to serve notice on any person lacking ""a legitimate business or social purpose"" for being on the premises and to arrest for trespassing any person who remains or returns after having been so notified. The RRHA gave respondent Hicks, a nonresident, written notice barring him from Whitcomb Court. Subsequently, he trespassed there and was arrested and convicted. At trial, he claimed that RRHA's policy was, among other things, unconstitutionally overbroad. The Virginia Court of Appeals vacated his conviction. In affirming, the Virginia Supreme Court found the policy unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment because an unwritten rule that leafleting and demonstrating require advance permission vested too much discretion in Whitcomb Court's manager. Held:  The RRHA's trespass policy is not facially invalid under the First Amendment's overbreadth doctrine. Pp. 118-124. (a) Under that doctrine, a showing that a law punishes a ""substantial"" amount of protected free speech, ""in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,""  Broadrick  v.  Oklahoma,  413 U. S. 601 , 615, suffices to invalidate all enforcement of that law ""until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression,"" id., at 613. Only substantial overbreadth supports such facial invalidation, since there are significant social costs in blocking a law's application to constitutionally unprotected conduct. Pp. 118-120. (b) This Court has jurisdiction to review the First Amendment merits question here. Virginia's actual injury in fact-the inability to prosecute Hicks for trespass-is sufficiently distinct and palpable to confer Article III standing. pp. 120-121. (c) Even assuming the invalidity of the ""unwritten"" rule for leafleters and demonstrators, Hicks has not shown that the RRHA policy prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech in relation to its many legit- 114 Syllabus imate applications. Both the notice-barment rule and the ""legitimate business or social purpose"" rule apply to all persons entering Whitcomb Court's streets, not just to those seeking to engage in expression. Neither the basis for the barment sanction (a prior trespass) nor its purpose (preventing future trespasses) implicates the First Amendment. An overbreadth challenge rarely succeeds against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or conduct necessarily associated with speech. Any applications of the RRHA's policy that violate the First Amendment can be remedied through as-applied litigation. Pp. 121-124. 264 Va. 48, 563 S. E. 2d 674, reversed and remanded.

BEAUMONT ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT 
No. 02-403. Argued March 25, 2003-Decided June 16,2003 A corporation is prohibited from making ""a contribution or expenditure in connection with"" certain federal elections, 2 U. S. C. § 441b(a), but not from establishing, administering, and soliciting contributions to a separate fund to be used for political purposes, §441b(b)(2)(C). Such a PAC (so called after the political action committee that runs it) is free to make contributions and other expenditures in connection with federal elections. Respondents, a nonprofit advocacy corporation known as North Carolina Right to Life, Inc., and others (collectively NCRL), sued petitioner Federal Election Commission (FE C), challenging the constitutionality of § 441b and its implementing regulations as applied to NCRL. As relevant here, the District Court granted NCRL summary judgment as to the ban on direct contributions, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed. Held:  Applying the direct contribution prohibition to nonprofit advocacy corporations is consistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 152-163. (a) An attack on the federal prohibition of direct corporate political contributions goes against the current of a century of congressional efforts to curb corporations' potentially deleterious influences on federal elections. Since 1907, federal law has barred such direct corporate contributions. Much of the subsequent congressional attention to corporate political activity has been meant to strengthen the original, core prohibition on such contributions.  Federal Election Comm'n  v.  National Right to Work Comm.,  459 U. S. 197 . As in 1907, current law focuses on the corporate structure's special characteristics that threaten the integrity of the political process.  Id.,  at 209. In barring corporate earnings from turning into political ""war chests,"" the ban was and is intended to ""preven[t] corruption or the appearance of corruption.""  Federal Election Comm'n  v.  National Conservative Political Action Comm.,  470 U. S. 480 , 496-497. The ban also protects individuals who have paid money into a corporation or union for other purposes from having their money used to support political candidates to whom they may be opposed,  National Right to Work, supra,  at 208, and hedges 147 against use of corporations as conduits for circumventing ""valid contribution limits,""  Federal Election Comm'n  v.  Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,  533 U. S. 431 ,456, and n. 18. Pp. 152-156. (b)  National Right to Work  all but decided against NCRUs position that § 441b's ban on direct contributions is unconstitutional as applied to nonprofit advocacy corporations. There, this Court upheld the part of § 441b restricting a nonstock corporation to its membership when soliciting PAC contributions, concluding that the congressional judgment to regulate corporate political involvement warrants considerable deference and reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers that corporations pose to the electoral process. 459 U. S., at 207-211. It would be hard to read this conclusion, except on the practical understanding that the corporation's capacity to make contributions was legitimately limited to indirect donations within the scope allowed to PACs. And the Court specifically rejected the argument made here, that deference to congressional judgments about corporate contribution limits turns on details of corporate form or the affluence of particular corporations.  National Right to Work  has repeatedly been read as approving § 441b's prohibition on direct contributions, even by nonprofit corporations without great financial resources. Equal significance must be accorded to  Federal Election Comm'n  v.  Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479  U. S. 238, on which NCRL and the Fourth Circuit have relied. In holding § 441b's prohibition on independent expenditures unconstitutional as applied to a nonprofit advocacy corporation, the Court there distinguished  National Right to Work  on the ground that it addressed regulation of contributions, not expenditures. Pp. 156-159. (c) This Court could not hold for NCRL without recasting its understanding of the risks of harm posed by corporate political contributions, of the expressive significance of contributions, and of the consequent deference owed to legislative judgments on what to do about them. NCRUs efforts do not unsettle existing law on these points. Its argument that  Massachusetts Citizens for Life-type  corporations pose no potential threat to the political system is rejected. Concern about the corrupting potential underlying the corporate ban may be implicated by advocacy corporations, which, like their for-profit counterparts, benefit from state-created advantages and may be able to amass substantial political war chests. Also rejected is NCRUs argument that the application of the ban on direct contributions should be subject to strict scrutiny because § 441b bars, rather than limits, contributions based on their source. When reviewing political financial restrictions, the level of scrutiny is based on the importance of the political activity at issue to effective speech or political association, and restrictions on political 148 contributions have long been treated as marginal speech restrictions subject to relatively complaisant First Amendment review because contributions lie closer to the edges than to the core of political expression. Thus, a contribution limit passes muster if it is closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest. The time to consider the difference between a ban and a limit is when applying scrutiny at the level selected, not in selecting the standard of review itself. But even NCRUs argument that § 441b is not closely drawn rests on the false premise that the provision is a complete ban. In fact, the provision allows corporate political participation through PACs. And this Court does not think that regulatory burdens on PACs, including restrictions on their ability to solicit funds, renders a PAC unconstitutional as an advocacy corporation's sole avenue for making political contributions.

No. 02-361. Argued March 5, 2003-Decided June 23, 2003 Two forms of federal assistance help public libraries provide patrons with Internet access: discounted rates under the E-rate program and grants under the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA). Upon discovering that library patrons, including minors, regularly search the Internet for pornography and expose others to pornographic images by leaving them displayed on Internet terminals or printed at library printers, Congress enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which forbids public libraries to receive federal assistance for Internet access unless they install software to block obscene or pornographic images and to prevent minors from accessing material harmful to them. Appellees, a group of libraries, patrons, Web site publishers, and related parties, sued the Government, challenging the constitutionality of CIPA's filtering provisions. Ruling that CIPA is facially unconstitutional and enjoining the Government from withholding federal assistance for failure to comply with CIPA, the District Court held,  inter alia,  that Congress had exceeded its authority under the Spending Clause because any public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will necessarily violate the First Amendment; that the CIPA filtering software constitutes a content-based restriction on access to a public forum that is subject to strict scrutiny; and that, although the Government has a compelling interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors, the use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further that interest.

MCCONNELL V. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N     
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 McCONNELL, UNITED STATES SENATOR, et al.  v.  FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION et al. 
 appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia 
 No. 02–1674. Argued September 8, 2003—Decided December 10, 2003 
 The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), which amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), the Communications Act of 1934, and other portions of the United States Code, is the most recent of nearly a century of federal enactments designed “to purge national politics of what [is] conceived to be the pernicious influence of ‘big money’ campaign contributions.”   United States  v.  Automobile Workers,   352 U. S. 567 , 572.  In enacting BCRA, Congress sought to address three important developments in the years since this Court’s landmark decision in  Buckley  v.  Valeo,   424 U. S. 1   (per curiam):  the increased importance of “soft money,” the proliferation of “issue ads,” and the disturbing findings of a Senate investigation into campaign practices related to the 1996 federal elections. 
 

      With regard to the first development, prior to BCRA, FECA’s disclosure requirements and source and amount limitations extended only to so-called “hard money” contributions made for the purpose of influencing an election for federal office.  Political parties and candidates were able to circumvent FECA’s limitations by contributing “soft money”—money as yet unregulated under FECA—to be used for activities intended to influence state or local elections; for mixed-purpose activities such as get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drives and generic party advertising; and for legislative advocacy advertisements, even if they mentioned a federal candidate’s name, so long as the ads did not expressly advocate the candidate’s election or defeat.  With regard to the second development, parties and candidates circumvented FECA by using “issue ads” that were specifically intended to affect election results, but did not contain “magic words,” such as “Vote Against Jane Doe,” which would have subjected the ads to FECA’s restrictions.  Those developments were detailed in a 1998 Senate Committee Report summarizing an investigation into the 1996 federal elections, which concluded that the soft-money loophole had led to a meltdown of the campaign finance system; and discussed potential reforms, including a soft-money ban and restrictions on sham issue advocacy by nonparty groups. 
 

      Congress enacted many of the committee’s proposals in BCRA: Title I regulates the use of soft money by political parties, officeholders, and candidates; Title II primarily prohibits corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for communications that are intended to, or have the effect of, influencing federal election outcomes; and Titles III, IV, and V set out other requirements.  Eleven actions challenging BCRA’s constitutionality were filed.  A three-judge District Court held some parts of BCRA unconstitutional and upheld others.  The parties challenging the law are referred to here as plaintiffs, and those who intervened in support of the law are intervenor-defendants. 
 Held : The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.   
 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 251 F. Supp. 2d 948, affirmed in part and reversed in part.   
    Justice Stevens and Justice O’Connor delivered the Court’s opinion with respect to BCRA Titles I and II, concluding that the statute’s two principal, complementary features—Congress’ effort to plug the soft-money loophole and its regulation of electioneering communications—must be upheld in the main.  Pp. 23–118. 
 

   1. New FECA §323 survives plaintiffs’ facial First Amendment challenge.  Pp. 23–77. 
 

      (a) In evaluating §323, the Court applies the less rigorous standard of review applicable to campaign contribution limits under  Buckley  and its progeny.  Such limits are subject only to “closely drawn” scrutiny, see 424  U. S., at 25, rather than to strict scrutiny, because, unlike restrictions on campaign expenditures, contribution limits “entai[l] only a marginal restriction upon the contributor’s ability to engage in free communication,”  e.g., id.,  at 20–21.  Moreover, contribution limits are grounded in the important governmental interests in preventing “both the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding of public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.”   E.g., Federal Election Comm’n  v.  National Right to Work Comm.,   459 U. S. 197 , 208.  The less rigorous review standard shows proper deference to Congress’ ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise, and provides it with sufficient room to anticipate and respond to concerns about circumvention of regulations designed to protect the political process’ integrity.  Finally, because Congress, in its lengthy deliberations leading to BCRA’s enactment, properly relied on  Buckley  and its progeny,  stare decisis  considerations, buttressed by the respect that the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe one another, provide additional powerful reasons for adhering to the analysis of contribution limits the Court has consistently followed since  Buckley.   The Court rejects   plaintiffs’ argument that the type of speech and associational burdens that §323 imposes are fundamentally different from the burdens that accompanied  Buckley ’s contribution limits.  Pp. 24–32. 
 

      (b) New FECA §323(a)—which forbids national party committees and their agents to “solicit, receive, … direct … , or spend any funds … that are not subject to [FECA’s] limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements,” 2 U. S. C. A. §§441i(a)(1), (2)—does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp. 32–52. 
 

         (1) The governmental interest underlying §323(a)—preventing the actual or apparent corruption of federal candidates and officeholders—constitutes a sufficiently important interest to justify contribution limits.  That interest is not limited to the elimination of  quid pro quo,  cash-for-votes exchanges, see  Buckley, supra , at 28, but extends also to “undue influence on an officeholder’s judgment, and the appearance of such influence,”  Federal Election Comm’n  v.  Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,  533 U. S. 431 , 441  (Colorado II) .  These interests are sufficient to justify not only contribution limits themselves, but also laws preventing the circumvention of such limits.   Id.,  at 456.  While the quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments varies with the novelty or plausibility of the justification raised,  Nixon  v.  Shrink Missouri Government PAC,  528 U. S. 377 , 391, the idea that large contributions to a national party can corrupt or create the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders is neither novel nor implausible, see,  e.g., Buckley ,  supra,  at 38.  There is substantial evidence in these cases to support Congress’ determination that such contributions of soft money give rise to corruption and the appearance of corruption.  For instance, the record is replete with examples of national party committees’ peddling access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large soft-money donations.  Pp. 32–45. 
 

         (2) Section §323(a) is not impermissibly overbroad because it subjects  all  funds raised and spent by national parties to FECA’s hard-money source and amount limits, including,  e.g.,  funds spent on purely state and local elections in which no federal office is at stake.  The record demonstrates that the close relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties, as well as the means by which parties have traded on that relationship, have made all large soft-money contributions to national parties suspect, regardless of how those funds are ultimately used.  The Government’s strong interests in preventing corruption, and particularly its appearance, are thus sufficient to justify subjecting all donations to national parties to FECA’s source, amount, and disclosure limitations.  Pp. 45–47. 
 

         (3) Nor is §323(a)’s prohibition on national parties’ soliciting or directing soft-money contributions substantially overbroad.  That prohibition’s reach is limited, in that it bars only soft-money solicitations by national party committees and party officers acting in their official capacities; the committees themselves remain free to solicit hard money on their own behalf or that of state committees and state and local candidates and to contribute hard money to state committees and candidates.  Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that the solicitation ban’s overbreadth is demonstrated by §323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited amounts of soft money from individual donors under certain circumstances.  The differences between §§323(a) and 323(e) are without constitutional significance, see  National Right to Work , 459 U. S., at 210, reflecting Congress’ reasonable and expert judgments about national committees’ functions and their interactions with officeholders.  Pp. 47–48. 
 

         (4) Section 323(a) is not substantially overbroad with respect to the speech and associational rights of minor parties, even though the latter may have slim prospects for electoral success.  It is reasonable to require that all parties and candidates follow the same rules designed to protect the electoral process’s integrity.   Buckley,  424 U. S., at 34–35.  A nascent or struggling minor party can bring an as-applied challenge if §323(a) prevents it from amassing the resources necessary to engage in effective advocacy.   Id.,  at 21.  Pp. 48–51. 
 

         (5) Plaintiffs’ argument that §323(a) unconstitutionally interferes with the ability of national committees to associate with state and local committees is unpersuasive because it hinges on an unnaturally broad reading of the statutory terms “spend,” “receive,” “direct,” and “solicit.”  Nothing on §323(a)’s face prohibits national party officers from sitting down with state and local party committees or candidates to plan and advise how to raise and spend soft money, so long as the national officers do not personally spend, receive, direct, or solicit soft money.  Pp. 51–52. 
 

      (c) On its face, new FECA §323(b)—which prohibits state and local party committees from using soft money for activities affecting federal elections, 2 U. S. C. A. §442i(b)—is closely drawn to match the important governmental interest of preventing corruption and its appearance.  Pp. 52–66. 
 

         (1) Recognizing that the close ties between federal candidates and state party committees would soon render §323(a)’s anticorruption measures ineffective if state and local committees remained available as a conduit for soft-money donations, Congress designed §323(b) to prevent donors from contributing nonfederal funds to such committees to help finance “Federal election activity,” which is defined to encompass (1) voter registration activity during the 120 days before a federal election; (2) voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activity “conducted in connection with an election in which a [federal] candidate … appears on the ballot”; (3) any “public communication” that “refers to a clearly identified [federal] candidate” and “promotes,” “supports,” “attacks,” or “opposes” such a candidate; and (4) the services of a state committee employee who dedicates more than 25% of his or her compensated time to “activities in connection with a Federal election,” 2 U. S. C. A. §§431(20)(A)(i–iv).  All activities that fall within this definition must be funded with hard money.  §441i(b)(1).  The Levin Amendment carves out an exception to this general rule, allowing state and local party committees to pay for certain federal election activities—namely, activities falling within categories (1) and (2) above that either do not refer to “a clearly identified candidate for Federal office,” or, if they involve broadcast communications, refer “solely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office,” §§441i(b)(2)(B)(i)–(ii)—with an allocated ratio of hard money and so-called “Levin funds.”  Levin funds are subject only to state regulation, but for two additional restrictions.  First, no contributor can donate more than $10,000 per year to a single committee’s Levin account.  §441i(b)(2)(B)(iii).  Second, both Levin funds and the allocated portion of hard money to pay for such activities must be raised by the state or local committee that spends them, though the committee can team up with other national, state, or local committees to solicit the hard-money portion.  §§441i(b)(2)(B)(iv), 441i(b)(2)(C).  Pp. 52–55. 
 

         (2) In addressing soft-money contributions to state committees, Congress both drew a conclusion and made a prediction.  It concluded from the record that soft money’s corrupting influence insinuates itself into the political process not only through national party committees, but also through state committees, which function as an alternate avenue for precisely the same corrupting forces.  Indeed, the evidence shows that both candidates and parties already ask donors who have reached their direct contribution limit to donate to state committees.  Congress’ reasonable prediction, based on the history of campaign finance regulation, was that donors would react to §323(a) by directing soft-money contributions to state committees for the purpose of influencing federal candidates and elections, and that federal candidates would be just as indebted to these contributors as they had been to those who had formerly contributed to the national parties.  Preventing corrupting activity from shifting wholesale to state committees and thereby eviscerating FECA clearly qualifies as an important governmental interest.  Pp. 55–57. 
 

         (3) Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that, even if §323(b) serves a legitimate interest, its restrictions are so unjustifiably burdensome and overbroad that they cannot be considered “closely drawn” to match the Government’s objectives.  Pp. 57–66. 
 

            (i) Section 323(b) is not substantially overbroad.  Although §323(b) captures some activities that affect state campaigns for nonfederal offices, these are the same activities that were covered by the FEC’s pre-BCRA allocation rules, and so had to be funded in part by hard money because they affected  both  federal and state elections.  As a practical matter, BCRA merely codifies the FEC’s allocation regime principles while justifiably adjusting the applicable formulas in order to restore the efficacy of FECA’s longstanding restriction on contributions to state and local committees for the purpose of influencing federal elections.  By limiting its reach to “Federal election activities,” §323(b) is narrowly focused on regulating contributions that directly benefit federal candidates and thus pose the greatest risk of corruption or its appearance.  The first two categories of “Federal election activity”—voter registration efforts and voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activities conducted in connection with a federal election—clearly capture activities that confer a substantial benefit on federal candidates by getting like-minded voters to the polls.  If a voter registration drive does not specifically mention a federal candidate, state committees can take advantage of the Levin Amendment’s higher contribution limits and relaxed source restrictions.  Moreover, because the record demonstrates abundantly that the third category of “Federal election activity,” “public communication[s]” that promote or attack a federal candidate, directly affects the election in which that candidate is participating, application of §323(b)’s contribution caps to such communications is closely drawn to the anticorruption interest it is intended to address.  Finally, Congress’ interest in preventing circumvention of §323(b)’s other restrictions justifies the requirement of the fourth category of “Federal election activity” that federal funds be used to pay any state or local party employee who spends more than 25% of his or her compensated time on activities connected with a federal election.  Pp. 58–63. 
 

            (ii) The Levin Amendment does not unjustifiably burden association among party committees by forbidding transfers of Levin funds among state parties, transfers of hard money to fund the allocable federal portion of Levin expenditures, and joint fundraising of Levin funds by state parties.  While preserving parties’ associational freedom is important, not every minor restriction on parties’ otherwise unrestrained ability to associate is of constitutional dimension.  See  Colorado II , 533 U. S., at 450, n. 11.  Given the delicate and interconnected regulatory scheme at issue here, any associational burdens imposed by the Levin Amendment restrictions are far outweighed by the need to prevent circumvention of the entire scheme.  Pp. 63–65. 
 

            (iii) The evidence supporting the argument that the Levin Amendment prevents parties from amassing the resources needed to engage in effective advocacy is speculative.  The history of campaign finance regulation proves that political parties are extraordinarily flexible in adapting to new restrictions on their fundraising abilities.  Moreover, the mere fact that §323(b) may reduce the money available to state and local parties to fund federal election activities is largely inconsequential.  The question is not whether the amount available over previous election cycles is reduced, but whether the reduction is so radical as to drive the sound of the recipient’s voice below the level of notice.   Shrink Missouri , 528 U. S., at 397.  If state or local parties can make such a showing, as-applied challenges remain available.  Pp. 65–66. 
 

      (d) New FECA §323(d)—which forbids national, state, and local party committees and their agents to “solicit any funds for, or make or direct any donations” to §501(c) tax exempt organizations that make expenditures in connection with a federal election, and to §527 political organizations “other than a political committee, a State, district, or local committee of a political party, or the authorized campaign committee of a candidate for State or local office,” 2 U. S. C. A. §441i(d)—is not facially invalid.  Pp. 66–73. 
 

         (1) Section 323(d)’s restriction on solicitations is a valid anti-circumvention measure.  Absent this provision, national, state, and local party committees would have significant incentives to mobilize their formidable fundraising apparatuses, including the peddling of access to federal officeholders, into the service of like-minded tax-exempt organizations that conduct activities benefiting their candidates.  All of the corruption and the appearance of corruption attendant on the operation of those fundraising apparatuses would follow.  Plaintiffs’ argument that §323(d)’s solicitations ban cannot be squared with §323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited soft-money donations to tax-exempt organizations engaged in federal election activities, is not persuasive.  If §323(d)’s solicitation restriction is otherwise valid, it is not rendered unconstitutional by the mere fact that Congress chose not to regulate the activities of another group as stringently as it might have.  See  National Right to Work,  459 U. S., at 210.  Furthermore, the difference between the two provisions is explained by the fact that national party officers, unlike federal candidates and officeholders, remain free to solicit soft money on behalf of nonprofit organizations in their individual capacities.  Given §323(e)’s tight content, source, and amount restrictions on soft-money solicitations by federal candidates and officeholders, as well as the less rigorous standard of review, §323(e)’s greater solicitation allowances do not render §323(d)’s solicitation restriction facially invalid.  Pp. 67–71. 
 

         (2) Section 323(d)’s restriction on donations to qualifying §501(c) or §527 organizations is a valid anticircumvention measure insofar as it prohibits donations of funds not already raised in compliance with FECA.  Absent such a restriction, state and local party committees could accomplish directly what the antisolicitation restrictions prevent them from doing indirectly—raising large sums of soft money to launder through tax-exempt organizations engaging in federal election activities.  Although the ban raises overbreadth concerns if read to restrict donations from a party’s federal account— i.e. , funds already raised in compliance with FECA’s source, amount, and disclosure limitations—these concerns do not require that the facial challenge be sustained, given this Court’s obligation to construe a statute, if possible, in such a way as to avoid constitutional questions, see,  e.g.,   Crowell  v.  Benson ,  285 U. S. 22 , 62.  Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Congress intended “donations” to include donations from a party’s hard-money account, and because of the constitutional infirmities such an interpretation would raise, the Court narrowly construes §323(d)’s ban to apply only to donations of funds not raised in compliance with FECA.  Pp. 71–73. 
 

      (e) New FECA §323(e)—which, with many exceptions, forbids federal candidates and officeholders to “solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend” soft money in connection with federal elections, 2 U. S. C. A. §441i(e)(1)(A), and limits their ability to do so for state and local elections, §441i(e)(1)(B)—does not violate the First Amendment.  No party seriously questions the constitutionality of the general ban on soft-money donations directly to federal candidates and officeholders and their agents.  By severing the most direct link to the soft-money donor, the ban is closely drawn to prevent the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  The solicitation restrictions are valid anticircumvention measures.  Even before BCRA’s passage, federal candidates and officeholders solicited donations to state and local parties, as well as tax-exempt organizations, in order to help their own, as well as their party’s, electoral cause.  See  Colorado II , 533 U. S., at 458.  The incentives to do so will only increase with Title I’s restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money by national, state, and local parties.  Section 323(e) addresses these concerns while accommodating the individual speech and associational rights of federal candidates and officeholders.  Pp. 74–77. 
 

      (f) New FECA §323(f)—which forbids state and local candidates or officeholders to raise and spend soft money to fund ads and other “public communications” that promote or attack federal candidates, 2 U. S. C. §442i(f)—is a valid anticircumvention provision.  The section places no cap on the funds that such candidates can spend on any activity, but, rather, limits only the source and amount of contributions that they can draw on to fund expenditures that directly impact federal elections.  And, by regulating only contributions used to fund “public communications,” the section focuses narrowly on those soft-money donations with the greatest potential to corrupt or give rise to the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders. Plaintiffs’ principal arguments against the section—(1) that the definition of “public communications” as communications that support or attack a clearly identified federal candidate is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; and (2) that soft-money contributions to state and local candidates for “public communications” do not corrupt or appear to corrupt federal candidates—are rejected.  Pp. 77–78. 
 

   2. Several plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that BCRA Title I exceeds Congress’ Election Clause authority to “make or alter” rules governing federal elections, U. S. Const., Art. I, §4, and violates constitutional federalism principles by impairing the States’ authority to regulate their own elections.  In examining federal Acts for Tenth Amendment infirmity, the Court focuses on whether States and state officials are commandeered to carry out federal regulatory schemes.  See,  e.g., Printz  v.  United States ,  521 U. S. 898 .  By contrast, Title I only regulates private parties’ conduct, imposing no requirements upon States or state officials.  And, because it does not expressly pre-empt state legislation, Title I leaves States free to enforce their own restrictions on state electoral campaign financing.  Moreover, while this Court has policed the absolute boundaries of Congress’ Article I power, see,  e.g., United States  v.  Morrison,  529 U. S. 598 , plaintiffs offer no reason to believe that Congress has overstepped its Elections Clause power in enacting BCRA.  Indeed, as already found, Title I is closely drawn to match Congress’ important interest in preventing the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  That interest is sufficient to ground Congress’ exercise of its Elections Clause power.  Pp. 79–80. 
 

   3. Also rejected is the argument that BCRA Title I violates equal protection by discriminating against political parties in favor of special interest groups, which remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings, and broadcast advertising (other than electioneering communications).  First, BCRA actually favors political parties in many ways,  e.g.,  by allowing party committees to receive individual contributions substantially exceeding FECA limits on contributions to nonparty political committees.  More importantly, Congress is fully entitled to consider the salient, real-world differences between parties and interest groups when crafting a campaign finance regulation system, see  National Right to Work , 459 U. S., at 210, including the fact that parties have influence and power in the legislature vastly exceeding any interest group’s.  Taken seriously, plaintiffs’ equal protection arguments would call into question not just BCRA Title I, but much of FECA’s pre-existing structure.  Pp. 82–85. 
 

   4. Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed insofar as it upheld §§323(e) and 323(f) and reversed insofar as it invalidated §§323(a), 323(b), and 323(d).  P. 82. 
 

   5. The District Court’s judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld the disclosure requirements in amended FECA §304 and rejected the facial attack on the provisions relating to donors of $1,000 or more, but reversed to the extent that it invalidated FECA §304(f)(5).  Pp. 82–95. 
 

      (a) BCRA §201 comprehensively amends FECA §304, which requires political committees to file detailed periodic financial reports with the FEC.  The narrowing construction adopted in  Buckley  limited FECA’s disclosure requirement to communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates.  BCRA adopts a new term, “electioneering communication,” which encompasses any “broadcast, cable, or satellite communication” that clearly identifies a candidate for federal office, airs within a specific time period ( e.g.,  within 60 days of a general election and 30 days of a primary), and is targeted to the relevant electorate.  2 U. S. C. A. §434(f)(3)(A)(i).  BCRA also amends §304 to provide disclosure requirements for persons who fund electioneering communications (and BCRA §203 amends FECA §316(b)(2) to extend those requirements to corporations and labor unions). 
 

      Plaintiffs challenge the new term’s constitutionality as it applies to both disclosures and expenditures, arguing primarily that  Buckley  drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy, and that speakers have an inviolable First Amendment right to engage in the latter category of speech.  However, a plain reading of  Buckley  and  Federal Election Comm’n  v.  Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,   479 U. S. 238   (MCFL),  shows that the express advocacy restriction is a product of statutory interpretation, not a constitutional command.  Both the concept of express advocacy and the class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional problems of vagueness and overbreadth in the statute before the  Buckley  Court.  Consistent with the principle that a constitutional rule should never be formulated more broadly than required by the facts to which it is to be applied,  Buckley  and  MCFL  were specific to the statutory language before the Court and in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.  The notion that the First Amendment erects a rigid barrier between express and issue advocacy also cannot be squared with this Court’s longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad.   Buckley ’s express advocacy line has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption, and Congress enacted BCRA to correct the flaws it found.  Finally, because the components of new FECA §304(f)(3)’s definition of “electioneering communication” are both easily understood and objectively determinable, the vagueness objection that persuaded the  Buckley  Court to limit FECA’s reach to express advocacy is inapposite here.  Pp. 82–88. 
 

      (b) With regard to plaintiffs’ other concerns about the use of the phrase “electioneering communication,” the District Court correctly rejected their submission that new FECA §304 unnecessarily requires disclosure of the names of persons who contributed $1,000 or more to the individual or group paying for the communication, but erred in finding §304(f)(5) invalid because it mandates disclosure of executory contracts for communications that have not yet aired.  Because the important state interests identified in  Buckley —providing the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and avoiding its appearance, and gathering data necessary to enforce more substantive electioneering restrictions—apply in full to BCRA,  Buckley  amply supports application of FECA §304’s disclosure requirements to the entire range of “electioneering communications.”   Buckley  also forecloses a facial attack on the new §304 provision that requires disclosure of the names of persons who contribute $1,000 or more to segregated funds or spend more than $10,000 in a calendar year on electioneering communications.  Under  Buckley ’s standard of proof, the evidence here did not establish the requisite reasonable probability of harm to any plaintiff group or its members resulting from compelled disclosure.  However,   the rejection of this facial challenge does not foreclose possible future challenges to particular applications of that disclosure requirement. 
 

      This Court is also unpersuaded by plaintiffs’ challenge to new FECA §304(f)(5)’s requirement regarding the disclosure of executory contracts.  The new provision mandates disclosure only when a person makes disbursements totaling more than $10,000 in any calendar year to pay for electioneering communications.  Given the relatively short time frames in which such communications are made, the interest in assuring that disclosures are made in time to provide relevant information to voters is significant.  Yet fixing the deadline for filing disclosure statements based on the date when aggregate disbursements exceed $10,000 would open a significant loophole without the advance disclosure requirement, for political supporters could avoid preelection disclosures about ads slated to run during a campaign’s final weeks simply by making a preelection downpayment of less than $10,000, with the balance payable after the election.  The record contains little evidence of any harm that might flow from the requirement’s enforcement, and the District Court’s speculation about such harm cannot outweigh the public interest in ensuring full disclosure before an election actually takes place.  Pp. 88–95. 
 

   6. The District Court’s judgment is affirmed insofar as it held that plaintiffs advanced no basis for finding unconstitutional BCRA §202, which amends FECA §315(a)(7)(C) to provide that disbursements for electioneering communications that are coordinated with a candidate or party will be treated as contributions to, and expenditures by, that candidate or party, 2 U. S. C. A. §441a(a)(7)(C).  That provision clarifies the scope of §315(a)(7)(B), which provides that expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of a candidate or party constitute contributions.  BCRA pre-empts a possible claim that the term “expenditure” in §315(a)(7)(B) is limited to spending for express advocacy.  Because  Buckley’ s narrow interpretation of that term was only a statutory limitation on Congress’ power to regulate federal elections, there is no reason why Congress may not treat coordinated disbursements for electioneering communications in the same way it treats other coordinated expenditures.  Pp. 96–97. 
 

   7. The District Court’s judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld the constitutionality of new FECA §316(b)(2), and reversed to the extent that it invalidated any part of that section.  BCRA §203 extends to all “electioneering communications” FECA §316(b)(2)’s restrictions on the use of corporate and union general treasury funds.  2 U. S. C. A. §441b(b)(2).  Because those entities may still organize and administer segregated funds, or PACs, for such communications, the provision is a regulation of, not a ban on, expression.   Beaumont,  539 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  This Court’s consideration of plaintiffs’ claim that the expanded regulation is both overinclusive and underinclusive is informed by the conclusion that the distinction between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy is not constitutionally compelled.  Thus, the Court examines the degree to which BCRA burdens First Amendment expression and evaluates whether a compelling governmental interest justifies that burden.  Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving that new FECA §316(b)(2) is overbroad.  They argue that the justifications that adequately support regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the electioneering communications definition.  That argument fails to the extent that issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for regulating express advocacy apply equally to those ads if they have an electioneering purpose, which the vast majority do.  Also rejected is plaintiffs’ argument that new FECA §316(b)(2)’s segregated-fund requirement is underinclusive because it does not apply to print or Internet advertising.  The record here reflects that corporations and unions used soft money to finance a virtual torrent of televised election-related ads during the relevant period.  Congress justifiably concluded that remedial legislation was needed to stanch that flow of money.  Finally, §304(f)(3)(B)(i), which excludes news items and commentary from the electioneering communications definition, is wholly consistent with First Amendment principles as applied to the media.  Pp. 97–103. 
 

   8. The District Court’s judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld new FECA §316(c)(6), as limited to nonprofit entities that are not so-called  MCFL  organizations.  BCRA §204, which adds §316(c)(6), 2 U. S. C. A. §441b(c)(2), extends to nonprofit corporations the prohibition on the use of general treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications.  This Court upheld a similar restriction in  Beaumont ,  supra,  except as it applied to organizations that are formed for the express purpose of promoting political ideas, have no shareholders, are not established by a business corporation or labor union, and do not accept contributions from those entities,  MCFL,  479 U. S., at 264.  The same constitutional objection to applying the pre-BCRA restrictions to such organizations necessarily applies with equal force to FECA §316(c)(6).  That §316(c)(6) does not, on its face, exempt  MCFL  organizations is not a sufficient reason to invalidate it.  This Court presumes that the legislators were fully aware that the provision could not apply to  MCFL -type entities, and the Government concedes that it does not.  As so construed, the provision is plainly valid.  Pp. 103–106. 
 

   9. Because this Court has already found BCRA §201’s executory contract disclosure requirement constitutional, plaintiffs’ challenge to a similar disclosure requirement in BCRA §212, which added FECA §304(g), 2 U. S. C. A. §434, is essentially moot.  Pp. 106–107. 
 

   10. The District Court’s judgment is affirmed to the extent that it invalidated BCRA §213, which amends FECA §315(d)(4) to require political parties to choose between coordinated and independent expenditures during the postnomination, preelection period.  2 U. S. C. A. §441a(d)(4).  That provision places an unconstitutional burden on the parties’ right to make unlimited independent expenditures.  Although the category of burdened speech is limited to independent expenditures for express advocacy—and therefore is relatively small—it plainly is entitled to First Amendment protection.  The governmental interest in requiring parties to avoid using magic words is not sufficient to support the burden imposed by §315(d)(4).  The fact that the provision is cast as a choice rather than an outright prohibition on independent expenditures does not make it constitutional.  Pp. 107–114. 
 

   11. The District Court’s judgment is affirmed to the extent that it rejected plaintiffs’ challenges to BCRA §214, which adds FECA §315(a)(7)(B)(ii), 2 U. S. C. A. §441a(a)(7)(b)(ii).  FECA §315(a)(7)(B)(i) long has provided that expenditures that are controlled by or coordinated with a candidate will be treated as contributions to the candidate.  BCRA §214(a) extends that rule to expenditures coordinated with political parties; and §§214 (b) and (c) direct the FEC to promulgate new regulations that do not “require agreement or formal collaboration to establish coordination,” 2 U. S. C. A. §441a(a) note.  FECA §315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is not overbroad simply because it permits a finding of coordination in the absence of a pre-existing agreement.  Congress has always treated expenditures made after a wink or nod as coordinated.  Nor does the absence of an agreement requirement render §315(a)(7)(B)(ii) unconstitutionally vague.  An agreement has never been required under §315(a)(7)(B)(i), which uses precisely the same language as the new provision to address coordination with candidates, and which has survived without constitutional challenge for almost three decades.  Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that that the definition has chilled political speech, and have made no attempt to explain how an agreement requirement would prevent the FEC from engaging in what they fear will be intrusive and politically motivated investigations.  Finally, in this facial challenge to BCRA, plaintiffs’ challenge to §§214(b) and (c) is not ripe to the extent that they allege constitutional infirmities in the FEC’s new regulations rather than the statute.  Pp. 114–119. 
 

   The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to miscellaneous BCRA Title III and IV provisions, concluding that the District Court’s judgment with respect to these provisions must be affirmed.  Pp. 2–11. 
 

   1. The plaintiffs’ challenges to BCRA §305, §307, and the millionaire provisions are nonjusticiable.  Pp. 2–8. 
 

      (a) The McConnell plaintiffs lack standing to challenge BCRA §305, which amends the federal Communications Act of 1934 requirement that, 45 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election, broadcast stations sell air time to a qualified candidate at their “lowest unit charge,” 47 U. S. C. §315(b).  Section 305’s amendment, in turn, denies a candidate the benefit of that charge in specified circumstances.  47 U. S. C. A. §§315(b)(2)(A), (C).  Senator McConnell’s testimony that he plans to run ads critical of his opponents and had run them in the past is too remote temporally to satisfy the Article III standing requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate an “injury in fact” that is “actual or imminent,”  Whitmore  v.  Arkansas,   495 U. S. 149 , 155, 158, given that the lowest unit charge requirement is not available until 45 days before a primary, that Senator McConnell’s current term does not expire until 2009, and that, therefore, the earliest day he could be affected by §305 is 45 days before the 2008 Republican primary election.  Pp. 2–4. 
 

      (b) The Adams and Paul plaintiffs lack standing to challenge BCRA §307, which amends FECA §315(a)(1) to increase and index for inflation certain contribution limits.  Neither injury alleged by the Adams plaintiffs, a group of voters, voter organizations, and candidates, is sufficient to confer standing.  First, their assertion that §307 deprives them of an equal ability to participate in the election process based on their economic status does not satisfy the standing requirement that a plaintiff’s alleged injury be an invasion of a concrete and particularized legally protected interest,  Lujan  v.  Defenders of Wildlife,   504 U. S. 555 , 560, since political “free trade” does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources,  e.g., MCFL,  479 U. S., at 257 .   Second, the Adams plaintiffs-candidates’ contention that §307 puts them at a “fundraising disadvantage” compared to their opponents because they do not wish to solicit or accept the large campaign contributions BCRA permits does not meet the standing requirement that their alleged injury be “fairly traceable” to §307, see  Lujan, supra,  at 562, since their alleged inability to compete stems not from §307’s operation, but from their own personal choice not to solicit or accept large contributions.  Also inadequate for standing purposes is the Paul plaintiffs’ contention that their congressional campaigns and public interest advocacy involve traditional press activities, such that §307’s contribution limits, together with FECA §315’s individual and PAC contribution limitations, impose unconstitutional editorial control on them in violation of the First Amendment’s Freedom of the Press Clause.  These plaintiffs cannot show the requisite substantial likelihood their requested relief will remedy their alleged injury in fact, see  Vermont Agency of Natural Resources  v.  United States ex rel. Stevens,  529 U. S. 765 , 771, since, even if the Court were to strike down BCRA §307’s increases and indexes, as they ask, both FECA’s contribution limits and an exemption for institutional news media would remain unchanged.  Pp. 4–8. 
 

      (c) The Adams plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the so-called “millionaire provisions,” BCRA §§304, 315, and 316, which provide for a series of staggered increases in otherwise applicable contribution-to-candidate limits if the candidate’s opponent spends a triggering amount of his personal funds, and eliminate the coordinated expenditure limits in certain circumstances.  Because these plaintiffs allege the same injuries that they alleged with regard to BCRA §307, they fail to state a cognizable injury that is fairly traceable to BCRA.  Additionally, none of them is a candidate in an election affected by the millionaire provisions, and it would be purely conjectural to assume that any of them ever will be.  P. 8. 
 

   2. The District Court’s decision upholding BCRA §311’s expansion of FECA §318(a) to include mandatory electioneering-communications-disbursements disclosure is affirmed because such inclusion bears a sufficient relationship to the important governmental interest of “shed[ding] the light of publicity” on campaign financing,  Buckley,  424 U. S., at 81 .   Assuming, as the Court must, that FECA §318 is valid both to begin with and as amended by BCRA §311’s amendments other than the electioneering-communications inclusion, the latter inclusion is not itself unconstitutional.  P. 9. 
 

   3. BCRA §318—which forbids individuals “17 years old or younger” to make contributions to candidates and political parties, 2 U. S. C. A. §441k—violates the First Amendment rights of minors, see,  e.g .,  Tinker  v.  Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.,   393 U. S. 503 , 511–513.  Because limitations on an individual’s political contributions impinge on the freedoms of expression and association, see  Buckley,  424 U. S., at 20–22, the Court applies heightened scrutiny to such a limitation, asking whether it is justified by a “sufficiently important interest” and “closely drawn” to avoid unnecessary abridgment of the First Amendment, see  e.g.,   post,  at 25–26 (joint opinion of Stevens   and O’Connor, JJ.).  The Government offers scant evidence for its assertion that §318 protects against corruption by conduit— i.e.,  donations by parents through their minor children to circumvent contribution limits applicable to the parents.  Absent a more convincing case of the claimed evil, this interest is simply too attenuated for §318 to withstand heightened scrutiny.  See  Shrink Missouri , 528 U. S., at 391.  Even assuming,  arguendo , the Government advances an important interest, the provision is overinclusive, as shown by the States’ adoption of more tailored approaches.  Pp. 9–11. 
 

   4. Because the FEC clearly has standing, the Court need not address whether the intervenor-defendants, whose position here is identical to the FEC’s, were properly granted intervention pursuant to,  inter alia , BCRA §403(b).  See,  e.g.,   Clinton  v.  City of New York,  524 U. S. 417 , 431–432, n. 19.  P. 11. 
 

   Justice Breyer delivered the Court’s opinion with respect to BCRA Title V—§504 of which amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require broadcasters to keep publicly available records of politically related broadcasting requests, 47 U. S. C. A. §315(e)—concluding that the portion of the judgment below invalidating §504 as facially violative of the First Amendment must be reversed.  Pp. 2–15. 
 

   1. Section 504’s “candidate request” requirements—which call for broadcasters to keep records of broadcast requests “made by or on behalf of any … candidate,” 47 U. S. C. A. §315(e)(1)(A)—are upheld.  They are virtually identical to those contained in a longstanding FCC regulation.  The McConnell plaintiffs’ argument that the requirements are intolerably burdensome and invasive is rejected.  The FCC has consistently estimated that its regulation imposes upon a licensee a comparatively small additional administrative burden.  Moreover, the §504 requirement is supported by significant governmental interests in verifying that licensees comply with their obligations to allow political candidates “equal time,” 47 U. S. C. §315(a), and to sell such time at the “lowest unit charge,” §315(b); in evaluating whether they are processing candidate requests in an evenhanded fashion to help assure broadcasting fairness, §315(a); in making the public aware of how much candidates spend on broadcast messages; 2 U. S. C. A. §434; and in providing an independently compiled set of data for verifying candidates’ compliance with BCRA’s and FECA’s disclosure requirements and source limitations,  ibid.   Because the Court cannot, on the present record, find the longstanding FCC regulation unconstitutional, it cannot strike down BCRA §504’s “candidate request” provision, which simply embodies the regulation in a statute, thereby blocking any agency attempt to repeal it.  Pp. 3–7. 
 

   2. Because §504’s “candidate request” requirements are constitutional, its “election message” requirements—which serve similar governmental interests and impose only a small incremental burden in requiring broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast “message[s]” that refer either to a “legally qualified candidate” or to “any election to Federal office,” 47 U. S. C. A. §§315(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii)—must be constitutional as well.  Pp. 8–9. 
 

   3. BCRA §504’s “issue request” requirements—which call for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast “message[s]” related to a “national legislative issue of public importance,” 47 U. S. C. A. §315(e)(1)(B)(iii), or a “political matter of national importance,” §315(e)(1)(B)—survive the McConnell plaintiffs’ facial challenge.  These recordkeeping requirements seem likely to help determine whether broadcasters are fulfilling their obligations under the FCC’s regulations to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on important public issues or whether they too heavily favor entertainment, discriminating against public affairs broadcasts.  The plaintiffs’ claim that the above-quoted statutory language is unconstitutionally vague or overbroad is unpersuasive, given that it is no more general than language Congress has used to impose other obligations upon broadcasters and is roughly comparable to other BCRA language upheld in this litigation.  Whether the “issue request” requirements impose disproportionate administrative burdens will depend on how the FCC interprets and applies them.  The parties remain free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCC’s regulations, or as otherwise applied.  Without the greater information any such challenge will likely provide, the Court cannot say that the provisions’ administrative burdens are so great, or their justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding them facially unconstitutional.  Similarly, the argument that the “issue request” requirement will force the purchasers to disclose information revealing their political strategies to opponents does not show that BCRA §504 is facially unconstitutional, but the plaintiffs remain free to raise this argument when §504 is applied.  Pp. 9–12.

LOCKE V. DAVEY     
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 LOCKE, GOVERNOR OF WASHINGTON, et al.  v.  DAVEY 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 02–1315. Argued December 2, 2003—Decided February 25, 2004 
 Washington State established its Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses.  In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use such a scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree.  Respondent Davey was awarded a Promise Scholarship and chose to attend Northwest College, a private, church-affiliated institution that is eligible under the program.  When he enrolled, Davey chose a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration.  It is undisputed that the pastoral ministries degree is devotional.  After learning that he could not use his scholarship to pursue that degree, Davey brought this action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 for an injunction and damages, arguing that the denial of his scholarship violated,  inter alia , the First Amendment’s Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses.  The District Court rejected Davey’s constitutional claims and granted the State summary judgment.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that, because the State had singled out religion for unfavorable treatment, its exclusion of theology majors had to be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest under  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.  v.  Hialeah,   508 U. S. 520 .  Finding that the State’s antiestablishment concerns were not compelling, the court declared the program unconstitutional. 
 Held:  Washington’s exclusion of the pursuit of a devotional theology degree from its otherwise-inclusive scholarship aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  This case involves the “play in the joints” between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.   Walz  v.  Tax Comm’n of City of New York,   397 U. S. 664 , 669.  That is, it concerns state action that is permitted by the former but not required by the latter.  The Court rejects Davey’s contention that, under  Lukumi, supra,  the program is presumptively unconstitutional because it is not facially neutral with respect to religion.  To accept this claim would extend the  Lukumi  line of cases well beyond not only their facts but their reasoning.  Here, the State’s disfavor of religion (if it can be called that) is of a far milder kind than in  Lukumi,  where the ordinance criminalized the ritualistic animal sacrifices of the Santeria religion.  Washington’s program imposes neither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious service or rite.  It neither denies to ministers the right to participate in community political affairs, see  McDaniel v.   Paty ,  435 U. S. 618 , nor requires students to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit, see,  e.g., Hobbie  v.  Unemployment Appeals Comm’n of Fla.,   480 U. S. 136 .  The State has merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction.  Even though the differently worded Washington Constitution draws a more stringent line than does the Federal Constitution, the interest it seeks to further is scarcely novel.  In fact, there are few areas in which a State’s antiestablishment interests come more into play.  Since this country’s founding, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an “established” religion.  Most States that sought to avoid such an establishment around the time of the founding placed in their constitutions formal prohibitions against using tax funds to support the ministry.  That early state constitutions saw no problem in explicitly excluding  only  the ministry from receiving state dollars reinforces the conclusion that religious instruction is of a different ilk from other professions.  Moreover, the entirety of the Promise Scholarship Program goes a long way toward including religion in its benefits, since it permits students to attend pervasively religious schools so long as they are accredited, and students are still eligible to take devotional theology courses under the program’s current guidelines.  Nothing in the Washington Constitution’s history or text or in the program’s operation suggests animus towards religion.  Given the historic and substantial state interest at issue, it cannot be concluded that the denial of funding for vocational religious instruction alone is inherently constitutionally suspect.  Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, Davey’s claim must fail.  The State’s interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial, and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on Promise Scholars.  If any room exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here.  Pp. 4–12.

CITY OF LITTLETON V. Z.&NBSPJ. GIFTS D-4, L.&NBSPL.&NBSPC.     
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 CITY OF LITTLETON, COLORADO  v.  Z. J. GIFTS D–4, L. L. C., dba CHRISTAL’S 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
 No. 02–1609. Argued March 24, 2004—Decided June 7, 2004 
 Under petitioner city’s “adult business license” ordinance, the city’s decision to deny a license may be appealed to the state district court pursuant to Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure.  Respondent Z. J. Gifts D–4, L. L. C. (hereinafter ZJ), opened an adult bookstore in a place not zoned for adult businesses.  Instead of applying for a license, ZJ filed suit attacking the ordinance as facially unconstitutional.  The Federal District Court rejected ZJ’s claims, but the Tenth Circuit held, as relevant here, that state law does not assure the constitutionally required “prompt final judicial  decision .” 
 Held:  The ordinance meets the First Amendment’s requirement that such a licensing scheme assure prompt judicial review of an administrative decision denying a license.  Pp. 3–9. 
    (a) The Court rejects the city’s claim that its licensing scheme need only provide prompt access to judicial review, but not a “prompt judicial determination,” of an applicant’s legal claim.  The city concedes that  Freedman  v.  Maryland,   380 U. S. 51 , 59, in listing constitutionally necessary “safeguards” applicable to a motion picture censorship statute, spoke of the need to assure a “prompt final judicial decision,” but adds that Justice O’Connor’s controlling plurality opinion in  FW/PBS, Inc.  v.  Dallas,   493 U. S. 215 , which addressed an adult business licensing scheme, did not use the word “decision,” instead speaking only of the “ possibility of prompt judicial review, ”  id.,  at 228 (emphasis added).  Justice O’Connor’s  FW/PBS  opinion, however, points out that  Freedman ’s “judicial review” safeguard is meant to prevent “undue delay,” 493 U. S., at 228, which includes  judicial , as well as  administrative,  delay.  A delay in issuing a judicial decision, no less than a delay in obtaining access to a court, can prevent a license from being “issued within a reasonable period of time.”   Ibid.   Nothing in the opinion suggests the contrary.  Pp. 3–6. 
 

   (b) However, the Court accepts the city’s claim that Colorado law satisfies any “prompt judicial determination” requirement, agreeing that the Court should modify  FW/PBS,  withdrawing its implication that  Freedman ’s special judicial review rules— e.g.,  strict time limits—apply in this case.  Colorado’s ordinary “judicial review” rules suffice to assure a prompt judicial  decision,  as long as the courts remain sensitive to the need to prevent First Amendment harms and administer those procedures accordingly.  And whether the courts do so is a matter normally fit for case-by-case determination rather than a facial challenge.  Four considerations support this conclusion.  First, ordinary court procedural rules and practices give reviewing courts judicial tools sufficient to avoid delay-related First Amendment harm.  Indeed, courts may arrange their schedules to “accelerate” proceedings, and higher courts may grant expedited review.  Second, there is no reason to doubt state judges’ willingness to exercise these powers wisely so as to avoid serious threats of delay-induced First Amendment harm.  And federal remedies would provide an additional safety valve in the event of any such problem.  Third, the typical First Amendment harm at issue here differs from that at issue in  Freedman , diminishing the need in the typical case for procedural rules imposing special decisionmaking time limits.  Unlike in  Freedman , this ordinance does not seek to  censor  material.  And its licensing scheme applies reasonably objective, nondiscretionary criteria unrelated to the content of the expressive materials that an adult business may sell or display.  These criteria are simple enough to apply and their application simple enough to review that their use is unlikely in practice to suppress totally any specific item of adult material in the community.  And the criteria’s simple objective nature means that in the ordinary case, judicial review, too, should prove simple, hence expeditious.  Finally, nothing in  FW/PBS  or  Freedman  requires a city or State to place judicial review safeguards all in the city ordinance that sets forth a licensing scheme.  Pp. 6–9.

 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
 No. 03–218. Argued March 2, 2004—Decided June 29, 2004 
 To protect minors from exposure to sexually explicit materials on the Internet, Congress enacted the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U. S. C. §231, which, among other things, imposes a $50,000 fine and 6 months in prison for the knowing posting, for “commercial purposes,” of World Wide Web content that is “harmful to minors,” but provides an affirmative defense to commercial Web speakers who restrict access to prohibited materials by “requiring use of a credit card” or “any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology,” §231(c)(1).  COPA was enacted in response to  Reno  v.  American Civil Liberties Union ,  521 U. S. 844 , in which this Court held that the Communications Decency Act of 1996, Congress’ first attempt to make the Internet safe for minors by criminalizing certain Internet speech, was unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest and because less restrictive alternatives were available.  Respondents, Web speakers and others concerned with protecting the freedom of speech, filed suit for a preliminary injunction against COPA’s enforcement.  After considering testimony presented by both respondents and the Government, the District Court granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that respondents were likely to prevail on their argument that there were less restrictive alternatives to COPA, particularly blocking or filtering technology.  The Third Circuit affirmed on different grounds, but this Court reversed,  Ashcroft  v.  American Civil Liberties Union,  535 U. S. 564 .  On remand, the Third Circuit again affirmed, concluding,  inter alia , that COPA was not the least restrictive means available for the Government to serve the interest of preventing minors from using the Internet to gain access to harmful materials. 
 Held:  The Third Circuit was correct to affirm the District Court’s ruling that enforcement of COPA should be enjoined because the statute likely violates the First Amendment.  Pp. 6–15. 
    (a) The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it entered the preliminary injunction.  The abuse-of-discretion standard applies on review of such an injunction.  Because 28 U. S. C. §1254(1)’s grant of appellate jurisdiction does not give this Court license to depart from an established review standard,  Walters  v . National Assn. of Radiation Survivors ,  473 U. S. 305 , 336, the injunction must be upheld and the case remanded for trial on the merits if the underlying constitutional question is close.  There is therefore no need to consider the broader constructions of the statute adopted by the Court of Appeals.  The District Court concentrated primarily on the argument that there are plausible, less restrictive alternatives to COPA.  See  Reno,  521 U. S., at 874.  When plaintiffs challenge a content-based speech restriction, the Government has the burden to prove that the proposed alternatives will not be as effective as the challenged statute.   Ibid.   The purpose of the test is to ensure that speech is restricted no further than is necessary to accomplish Congress’ goal.  The District Court’s conclusion that respondents were likely to prevail was not an abuse of discretion, because, on the record, the Government has not met its burden.  Most importantly, respondents propose that blocking and filtering software is a less restrictive alternative, and the Government had not shown it would be likely to disprove that contention at trial.  Filters impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not universal restrictions at the source.  Under a filtering regime, childless adults may gain access to speech they have a right to see without having to identify themselves or provide their credit card information.  Even adults with children may obtain access to the same speech on the same terms simply by turning off the filter on their home computers.  Promoting filter use does not condemn as criminal any category of speech, and so the potential chilling effect is eliminated, or at least much diminished.  Filters, moreover, may well be more effective than COPA.  First, the record demonstrates that a filter can prevent minors from seeing all pornography, not just pornography posted to the Web from America.  That COPA does not prevent minors from accessing foreign harmful materials alone makes it possible that filtering software might be more effective in serving Congress’ goals.  COPA’s effectiveness is likely to diminish even further if it is upheld, because providers of the materials covered by the statute simply can move their operations overseas.  In addition, the District Court found that verification systems may be subject to evasion and circumvention,  e.g.,  by minors who have their own credit cards.  Finally, filters also may be more effective because they can be applied to all forms of Internet communication, including e-mail, not just the World Wide Web.  Filtering’s superiority to COPA is confirmed by the explicit findings of the Commission on Child Online Protection, which Congress created to evaluate the relative merits of different means of restricting minors’ ability to gain access to harmful materials on the Internet.  §231, note.  Although filtering software is not a perfect solution because it may block some materials not harmful to minors and fail to catch some that are, the Government has not satisfied its burden to introduce specific evidence proving that filters are less effective.  The argument that filtering software is not an available alternative because Congress may not require its use carries little weight, since Congress may act to encourage such use by giving strong incentives to schools and libraries,  United States v. American Library Assn.,   Inc.,   539 U.S. 194 , and by promoting the development of filters by industry and their use by parents.  The closest precedent is  United States  v.  Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,   529 U. S. 803 ,   which, like this case, involved a content-based restriction designed to protect minors from viewing harmful materials.  The Court there concluded that, absent a showing that a less restrictive technological alternative already available to parents would not be as effective as a blanket speech restriction, the more restrictive option preferred by Congress could not survive strict scrutiny.   Id.,  at 826.  The reasoning of  Playboy Entertainment Group ,   and the holdings and force of this Court’s precedents, compel the Court to affirm the preliminary injunction here.  To do otherwise would be to do less than the First Amendment commands.   Id.,  at 830.  Pp. 6–12. 
 

   (b) Important practical reasons also support letting the injunction stand pending a full trial on the merits.  First, the potential harms from reversal outweigh those of leaving the injunction in place by mistake.  Extraordinary harm and a serious chill upon protected speech may result where, as here, a prosecution is a likely possibility but only an affirmative defense is available, so that speakers may self-censor rather than risk the perils of trial.  Cf.  Playboy Entertainment Group ,  supra,  at 817.  The harm done from letting the injunction stand pending a trial on the merits, in contrast, will not be extensive.  Second, there are substantial factual disputes remaining in the case, including a serious gap in the evidence as to the filtering software’s effectiveness.  By allowing the preliminary injunction to stand and remanding for trial, the Court requires the Government to shoulder its full constitutional burden of proof respecting the less restrictive alternative argument, rather than excuse it from doing so.  Third, the factual record does not reflect current technological reality—a serious flaw in any case involving the Internet, which evolves at a rapid pace.  It is reasonable to assume that technological developments important to the First Amendment analysis have occurred in the five years since the District Court made its factfindings.  By affirming the preliminary injunction and remanding for trial, the Court allows the parties to update and supplement the factual record to reflect current technology.  Remand will also permit the District Court to take account of a changed legal landscape: Since that court made its factfindings, Congress has passed at least two further statutes that might qualify as less restrictive alternatives to COPA—a prohibition on misleading domain names, and a statute creating a minors-safe “dot-Kids” domain.  Pp. 12–15.

PER CURIAM 
SAN DIEGO V. ROE 
543 U. S. ____ (2004) 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 CITY OF SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA et al. 
 v.  JOHN ROE 
 on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 03–1669.Decided December 6, 2004 
    Per Curiam. 
 
   The city of San Diego (City), a petitioner here, terminated a police officer, respondent, for selling videotapes he made and for related activity.  The tapes showed the respondent engaging in sexually explicit acts.  Respondent brought suit alleging, among other things, that the termination violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech.  The United States District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the City.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 
 

   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. 
 I 
 
   Respondent John Roe, a San Diego police officer, made a video showing himself stripping off a police uniform and masturbating.  He sold the video on the adults-only section of eBay, the popular online auction site.  His user name was “Codestud3@aol.com,” a word play on a high priority police radio call.  356 F. 3d 1108, 1110 (CA9 2004).  The uniform apparently was not the specific uniform worn by the San Diego police, but it was clearly identifiable as a police uniform.  Roe also sold custom videos, as well as police equipment, including official uniforms of the San Diego Police Department (SDPD), and various other items such as men’s underwear.  Roe’s eBay user profile identified him as employed in the field of law enforcement. 
    Roe’s supervisor, a police sergeant, discovered Roe’s activities when, while on eBay, he came across an official SDPD police uniform for sale offered by an individual with the username “Codestud3@aol.com.”  He searched for other items Codestud3 offered and discovered listings for Roe’s videos depicting the objectionable material.  Recognizing Roe’s picture, the sergeant printed images of certain of Roe’s offerings and shared them with others in Roe’s chain of command, including a police captain.  The captain notified the SDPD’s internal affairs department, which began an investigation.  In response to a request by an undercover officer, Roe produced a custom video.  It showed Roe, again in police uniform, issuing a traffic citation but revoking it after undoing the uniform and masturbating. 
 

   The investigation revealed that Roe’s conduct violated specific SDPD policies, including conduct unbecoming of an officer, outside employment, and immoral conduct.  When confronted, Roe admitted to selling the videos and police paraphernalia.  The SDPD ordered Roe to “cease displaying, manufacturing, distributing or selling any sexually explicit materials or engaging in any similar behaviors, via the internet, U. S. Mail, commercial vendors or distributors, or any other medium available to the public.”  356 F. 3d, at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although Roe removed some of the items he had offered for sale, he did not change his seller’s profile, which described the first two videos he had produced and listed their prices as well as the prices for custom videos.  After discovering Roe’s failure to follow its orders, the SDPD—citing Roe for the added violation of disobedience of lawful orders—began termination proceedings.  The proceedings resulted in Roe’s dismissal from the police force. 
 

   Roe brought suit in the District Court pursuant to Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the employment termination violated his First Amendment right to free speech.  In granting summary judgment to the City, the District Court decided that Roe had not demonstrated that selling official police uniforms and producing, marketing, and selling sexually explicit videos for profit qualified as expression relating to a matter of “public concern” under this Court’s decision in  Connick  v.  Myers,   461 U. S. 138  (1983). 
 

   In reversing, the Court of Appeals held Roe’s conduct fell within the protected category of citizen commentary on matters of public concern.  Central to the Court of Appeals’ conclusion was that Roe’s expression was not an internal workplace grievance, took place while he was off-duty and away from his employer’s premises, and was unrelated to his employment.  356 F. 3d, at 1110, 1113–1114. 
 II 
 
   A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment.  See , e.g., Keyishian  v.  Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y.,   385 U. S. 589 , 605–606 (1967).  On the other hand, a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees, restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public.  The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern, typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large, a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment.  See  Connick,   supra;   Pickering  v.  Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,   391 U. S. 563  (1968).   Outside of this category, the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment, the speech can have First Amendment protection, absent some governmental justification “far stronger than mere speculation” in regulating it.   United States  v.  Treasury Employees,   513 U. S. 454 , 465, 475 (1995)  (NTEU).   We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases. 
 A 
 
   In concluding that Roe’s activities qualified as a matter of public concern, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Court’s decision in  NTEU .  356 F. 3d, at 1117.  In  NTEU  it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer.  The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees.  The Court held that, within the particular classification of employment, the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations.  The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities.  The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art,  NTEU ,  supra,  at 465, and observed that none of the speech at issue “even arguably [had] any adverse impact” on the employer.   Ibid . 
    The Court of Appeals’ reliance on  NTEU  was seriously misplaced.  Although Roe’s activities took place outside the workplace and purported to be about subjects not related to his employment, the SDPD demonstrated legitimate and substantial interests of its own that were compromised by his speech.  Far from confining his activities to speech unrelated to his employment, Roe took deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work, all in a way injurious to his employer.  The use of the uniform, the law enforcement reference in the Web site, the listing of the speaker as “in the field of law enforcement,” and the debased parody of an officer performing indecent acts while in the course of official duties brought the mission of the employer and the professionalism of its officers into serious disrepute.  356 F. 3d, at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
 

   The Court of Appeals noted the City conceded Roe’s activities were “unrelated” to his employment.   Id.,  at 1112, n. 4.  In the context of the pleadings and arguments, the proper interpretation of the City’s statement is simply to underscore the obvious proposition that Roe’s speech was not a comment on the workings or functioning of the SDPD.  It is quite a different question whether the speech was detrimental to the SDPD.  On that score the City’s consistent position has been that the speech is contrary to its regulations and harmful to the proper functioning of the police force.   The present case falls outside the protection afforded in  NTEU .  The authorities that instead control, and which are considered below, are this Court’s decisions in  Pickering,   supra,   Connick,   supra,  and the decisions which follow them. 
 B 
 
   To reconcile the employee’s right to engage in speech and the government employer’s right to protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission, the  Pickering  Court adopted a balancing test.  It requires a court evaluating restraints on a public employee’s speech to balance “the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.”  391 U. S., at 568; see also  Connick,   supra,  at 142. 
    Underlying the decision in  Pickering  is the recognition that public employees are often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions as to the operations of their public employers, operations which are of substantial concern to the public.  Were they not able to speak on these matters, the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues.  See   391 U. S., at 572.  The interest at stake is as much the public’s interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee’s own right to disseminate it. 
 

    Pickering  did not hold that any and all statements by a public employee are entitled to balancing.  To require  Pickering  balancing in every case where speech by a public employee is at issue, no matter the content of the speech, could compromise the proper functioning of government offices.  See  Connick,  461 U. S., at 143.   This concern prompted the Court in  Connick  to explain a threshold inquiry (implicit in  Pickering  itself) that in order to merit  Pickering  balancing, a public employee’s speech must touch on a matter of “public concern.”  461 U. S., at 143 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
 

   In  Connick , an assistant district attorney, unhappy with her supervisor’s decision to transfer her to another division, circulated an intraoffice questionnaire.  The document solicited her co-workers’ views on,  inter alia , office transfer policy, office morale, the need for grievance committees, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns.  See  id ., at 141. 
 

   Finding that—with the exception of the final question—the questionnaire touched not on matters of public concern but on internal workplace grievances, the Court held no  Pickering  balancing was required.  461 U. S., at 141.   To conclude otherwise would ignore the “common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.”   Id ., at 143.   Connick  held that   a public employee’s speech is entitled to  Pickering  balancing only when the employee speaks “as a citizen upon matters of public concern” rather than “as an employee upon matters only of personal   interest.”  461 U. S., at 147. 
 

   Although the boundaries of the public concern test are not well-defined,  Connick  provides some guidance.  It directs courts to examine the “content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record” in assessing whether an employee’s speech addresses a matter of public concern.   Id ., at 146–147.  In addition, it notes that the standard for determining whether expression is of public concern is the same standard used to determine whether a common-law action for invasion of privacy is present.   Id ., at 143, n. 5.  That standard is established by our decisions in  Cox Broadcasting Corp.  v.  Cohn,   420 U. S. 469  (1975), and  Time, Inc.  v.  Hill,   385 U. S. 374 , 387–388 (1967).  These cases make clear that public concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of publication.  The Court has also recognized that certain private remarks, such as negative comments about the President of the United States, touch on matters of public concern and should thus be subject to  Pickering  balancing.  See  Rankin  v.  McPherson,  483 U. S. 378  (1987). 
 

   Applying these principles to the instant case, there is no difficulty in concluding that Roe’s expression does not qualify as a matter of public concern under any view of the public concern test.  He fails the threshold test and  Pickering  balancing does not come into play. 
 

    Connick  is controlling precedent, but to show why this is not a close case it is instructive to note that even under the view expressed by the dissent in  Connick  from four Members of the Court, the speech here would not come within the definition of a matter of public concern.  The dissent in  Connick  would have held that the entirety of the questionnaire circulated by the employee “discussed subjects that could reasonably be expected to be of interest to persons seeking to develop informed opinions about the manner in which . . . an elected official charged with managing a vital governmental agency, discharges his responsibilities.”  461 U. S., at 163 (opinion of Brennan, J.).  No similar purpose could be attributed to the employee’s speech in the present case.  Roe’s activities did nothing to inform the public about any aspect of the SDPD’s functioning or operation.  Nor were Roe’s activities anything like the private remarks at issue in  Rankin , where one co-worker commented to another co-worker on an item of political news.  Roe’s expression was widely broadcast, linked to his official status as a police officer, and designed to exploit his employer’s image. 
 

   The speech in question was detrimental to the mission and functions of the employer.  There is no basis for finding that it was of concern to the community as the Court’s cases have understood that term in the context of restrictions by governmental entities on the speech of their employees. 
 

   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is 
 
 Reversed.

JOHANNS V. LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSN. 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 JOHANNS, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, et al.  v.  LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
 No. 03–1164.Argued December 8, 2004—Decided May 23, 2005 
 The Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 (Beef Act) establishes a federal policy of promoting and marketing beef and beef products.  The Secretary of Agriculture has implemented the Act through a Beef Promotion and Research Order (Order), which creates a Cattlemen’s Beef Promotion and Research Board (Beef Board) and an Operating Committee, and imposes an assessment, or “checkoff,” on all sales and importation of cattle.  The assessment funds, among other things, beef promotional campaigns approved by the Operating Committee and the Secretary.  Respondents, associations whose members pay the checkoff and individuals whose cattle are subject to the checkoff, challenged the program on First Amendment grounds, relying on  United States  v.  United Foods, Inc. ,  533 U. S. 405 , in which this Court invalidated a mandatory checkoff that funded mushroom advertising.  The District Court found that the Beef Act and Order unconstitutionally compel respondents to subsidize speech to which they object.  Affirming, the Eighth Circuit held that compelled funding of speech may violate the First Amendment even when it is the government’s speech. 
 Held:  Because the beef checkoff funds the Government’s own speech, it is not susceptible to a First Amendment compelled-subsidy challenge.  Pp. 5–15. 
    (a) This Court has sustained First Amendment challenges in “compelled-subsidy” cases, in which the government requires an individual to subsidize a private message he disagrees with.  See  Keller  v.  State Bar of Cal. ,  496 U. S. 1 ;  Abood  v.  Detroit Bd. of Ed. ,  431 U. S. 209 .   Keller  and  Abood  led the Court to sustain a compelled-subsidy challenge to an assessment whose only purpose was to fund mushroom advertising.   United Foods, supra,  at 413, 415–416.  However, the speech in  United Foods ,  Keller,  and  Abood  was found, or presumed, to be private.  The compelled-subsidy cases have consistently respected the principle that compelled support of private speech differs from compelled support of government speech.  The Court has generally assumed, though not squarely held, that such funding of government speech does not alone raise First Amendment concerns.  Pp. 5–8. 
 

   (b) Respondents argue that the speech here is not government speech because it is controlled by nongovernmental entities,  i.e.,  the Beef Board and Operating Committee.  In fact, the message is effectively controlled by the Federal Government.  Congress and the Secretary have set out the overarching message and some of the campaign’s elements, and have left the development of the remaining details to the Operating Committee, half of whose members are appointed by the Secretary and all of whom are subject to removal by the Secretary.  The Secretary also has final approval authority over every word in every promotional campaign, and his subordinates attend and participate in meetings at which proposals are developed.  By contrast, in  Keller  the compelled subsidy funded communicative activities that were not prescribed by law or developed under official government supervision.  Nor does the Order’s funding mechanism affect the compelled-subsidy analysis.  That citizens have no First Amendment right not to fund government speech is no less true when, as here, the funding is achieved through targeted assessments devoted to a program to which some assessed citizens object, rather than through general taxes.  The Court need not address respondents’ argument that the advertisements, most of which are credited to “America’s Beef Producers,” give the impression that respondents endorse their message.  Neither the Beef Act nor the Order requires attribution of the ads to “America’s Beef Producers” or to anyone else, so neither can be facially invalid on this theory, and the record contains no evidence from which to conclude that the ads’ message would be associated with respondents.  Pp. 8–15. 
 

   (c) Respondents may proceed with their other challenges to the Beef Act and Order, which the District Court did not reach.  P. 15. 
 335 F. 3d 711, vacated and remanded. 
    Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O’Connor, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., and Breyer, J., filed concurring opinions.  Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  Kennedy, J., filed a dissenting opinion.  Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens and Kennedy, JJ., joined. 
  Together with No. 03–1165,  Nebraska Cattlemen, Inc., et al.  v.  Livestock Marketing Association et al.,  also on certiorari to the same court.

 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
 No. 04–37.Argued January 19, 2005—Decided May 23, 2005 
 Under Oklahoma’s semiclosed primary law, a political party may invite only its own registered members and voters registered as Independents to vote in its primary.  When the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma (LPO) notified the State Election Board it wanted to open its upcoming primary to all registered voters regardless of party affiliation, the Board agreed as to Independents, but not as to other parties’ members.  The LPO and several Oklahomans registered as Republicans and Democrats then sued for equitable relief, alleging that Oklahoma’s statute unconstitutionally burdens their First Amendment right to freedom of political association.  The District Court upheld the statute on the grounds that it did not severely burden respondents’ associational rights and that any burden imposed was justified by Oklahoma’s asserted interests in preserving parties as viable and identifiable interest groups and in ensuring that primary results accurately reflect party members’ voting.  Reversing, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the statute imposed a severe burden on respondents’ associational rights and was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.   
 Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 
 363 F. 3d 1048, reversed and remanded.   
    Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court except as to Part II–A, concluding that Oklahoma’s semiclosed primary system does not violate the right to freedom of association.  Any burden it imposes is minor and justified by legitimate state interests.  Pp. 3–4, 8–16. 
 

   (a) The First Amendment protects citizens’ right “to band together in promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse their political views.”   California Democratic Party  v.  Jones,   530 U. S. 567 , 574.  Regulations imposing severe burdens on associational rights must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, but when they impose lesser burdens, “a State’s important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.”   Timmons  v.  Twin Cities Area New Party ,  520 U. S. 351 , 358.  In  Tashjian  v.  Republican Party of Conn. ,  479 U. S. 208 , 224, n. 13, the Court left open the question whether a State may prevent a political party from inviting registered voters of other parties to vote in its primary.  Pp. 3–4.   
 

   (b) Oklahoma’s system does not severely burden associational rights.  The Court disagrees with respondents’ argument that the burden Oklahoma imposes is no less severe than the burden at issue in  Tashjian,  and thus   the Court must apply strict scrutiny as it did in  Tashjian .   Tashjian  applied strict scrutiny without carefully examining the burden on associational rights.  Not every electoral law burdening associational rights is subject to strict scrutiny, which is appropriate only if the burden is severe,  e.g., Jones, supra , at 582.  Requiring voters to register with a party before participating in its primary minimally burdens voters’ associational rights.  Moreover,  Tashjian  is distinguishable.  Oklahoma’s semiclosed primary imposes an even less substantial burden than did the Connecticut closed primary at issue in  Tashjian .  Unlike that law, Oklahoma’s system does not require Independent voters to affiliate publicly with a party to vote in its primary, 479 U. S., at 216, n. 7.  Although, like the earlier law, Oklahoma’s statute does not allow parties to “broaden opportunities for joining … by their own act,” but requires intervening action by potential voters,”  ibid.,  this burden is not severe, since many electoral regulations require that voters take some action to participate in the primary process.  Such minor barriers between voter and party do not compel strict scrutiny.  See  Bullock  v.  Carter,   405 U. S. 134 , 143.  To deem ordinary and widespread burdens like these severe would subject virtually every electoral regulation to strict scrutiny, hamper the ability of States to run efficient and equitable elections, and compel federal courts to rewrite state electoral codes.  The Constitution does not require that result.  Pp. 8–10.   
 

   (c) Oklahoma’s primary advances a number of regulatory interests this Court recognizes as important: It “preserv[es] [political] parties as viable and identifiable interest groups,”  Nader  v.  Schaffer , 417 F. Supp. 837, 845 (D. Conn.), aff’d,  429 U. S. 989 ; enhances parties’ electioneering and party-building efforts, 417 F. Supp., at 848; and guards against party raiding and “sore loser” candidacies by spurned primary contenders,  Storer  v.  Brown,   415 U. S. 724 , 735.  Pp. 10–14. 
 

   (d) The Court declines to consider respondents’ expansion of their challenge to include several of Oklahoma’s ballot access and voter registration laws.  Those claims were neither raised nor decided below, see,  e.g.,   Cooper Industries, Inc.  v.  Aviall Services, Inc.,  543 U. S. ___, ___, and respondents have pointed to no unusual circumstances warranting their consideration now, see  Taylor  v.  Freeland & Kronz,   503 U. S. 638 , 645–646.  Pp. 14–16. 
 

   Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy, concluded in Part II–A that a voter unwilling to disaffiliate from another party in order to vote in the LPO’s primary forms little “association” with the LPO—nor the LPO with him.  See  Tashjian, supra , at 235.  But even if Oklahoma’s system burdens an associational right, the burden is less severe than others this Court has upheld as constitutional.  The reasons underpinning  Timmons, supra,  show that Oklahoma’s system burdens the LPO only minimally.  As in  Timmons , Oklahoma’s law does not regulate the LPO’s internal processes, its authority to exclude unwanted members, or its capacity to communicate with the public.  And just as in  Timmons , in which a Minnesota law conditioned a party’s ability to nominate the candidate of its choice on the candidate’s willingness to disaffiliate from another party, Oklahoma conditions a party’s ability to welcome a voter into its primary on the voter’s willingness to dissociate from his current party of choice.  If a party may be prevented from associating with its desired standard bearer   because he refuses to disaffiliate from another party, it may also be prevented from associating with a voter who refuses to do the same.  Oklahoma’s system imposes an even slighter burden on voters than on the LPO.  Disaffiliation is not difficult: Other parties’ registered members who wish to vote in the LPO primary simply need to file a form changing their registration.  Voters are not “locked in” to an unwanted party affiliation, see  Kusper  v.  Pontikes,   414 U. S. 51 , 60–61, because with only nominal effort they are free to vote in the LPO primary.  Pp. 4–8. 
 

   Justice O’Connor, joined by Justice Breyer except as to Part III, agreed with most of the Court’s reasoning, but wrote separately to emphasize two points.  First, the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma (LPO) and voters registered with another party have constitutionally cognizable interests in associating with one another through the LPO’s primary, and these interests should not be minimized to dispose of this case.  Second, while the Court is correct that only Oklahoma’s semiclosed primary law is properly under review, that standing alone it imposes only a modest, nondiscriminatory burden on respondents’ associational rights, and that this burden is justified by the State’s legitimate regulatory interests, there are some grounds for concern that other Oklahoma laws governing party recognition and changes in party affiliation may unreasonably restrict voters’ ability to participate in the LPO’s primary.  A realistic assessment of regulatory burdens on associational rights would, in an appropriate case, require examination of the cumulative effects of the State’s overall primary scheme; and any finding of a more severe burden would trigger more probing review of the State’s justifications.  Pp. 1–11. 
    Thomas, J., delivered an opinion, which was for the Court except as to Part II–A.  Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and O’Connor and Breyer, JJ., joined except as to Part II–A.  O’Connor, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Breyer, J., joined except as to Part III.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined, and in which Souter, J., joined as to Parts I, II, and III.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 TORY et al.  v . COCHRAN 
 certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district 
 No. 03–1488.Argued March 22, 2005—Decided May 31, 2005 
 In a state-law defamation action filed by attorney Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., a California trial court found that petitioner Tory, assisted by petitioner Craft and others, had,  inter alia,  falsely claimed that Cochran owed him money, picketed Cochran’s office with signs containing insults and obscenities, and pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults, in order to coerce Cochran into paying Tory money to desist from such libelous and slanderous activity.  Because Tory indicated that he would continue to engage in the activity absent a court order, the court permanently enjoined petitioners and their agents from, among other things, picketing, displaying signs, and making oral statements about Cochran and his firm in any public forum. The California Court of Appeal affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari.  After oral argument, Cochran’s counsel informed the Court of Cochran’s death, moved to substitute Cochran’s widow as respondent, and suggested that the case be dismissed as moot.  Petitioners agreed to the substitution, but denied that the case was moot. 
 Held:  Cochran’s widow is substituted as respondent, but the case is not moot.  Despite Cochran’s death, the injunction remains in effect.  Nothing in its language says to the contrary.  Cochran’s counsel argues that the injunction is still necessary, valid, and enforceable, and no source of California law says that it automatically became invalid upon Cochran’s death.  As this Court understands that law, a person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has ruled that it is.  Given this uncertainty, the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners’ speech, thus presenting an ongoing federal controversy.  Cochran’s death, however, makes it unnecessary for this Court to explore petitioners’ basic claims.  Rather, the Court need only point out that the injunction, as written, has lost its underlying rationale.  Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer coerce Cochran to pay for desisting in this activity, the grounds for the injunction are much diminished or have disappeared altogether.  Consequently the injunction amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking plausible justification.  Pp. 2–4. 
 Vacated and remanded.

 VAN ORDEN  v . PERRY, in his official capacity as GOVERNOR OF TEXAS and CHAIRMAN, STATE PRESERVATION BOARD, et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
 No. 03–1500.Argued March 2, 2005—Decided June 27, 2005 
 Among the 21 historical markers and 17 monuments surrounding the Texas State Capitol is a 6-foot-high monolith inscribed with the Ten Commandments.  The legislative record illustrates that, after accepting the monument from the Fraternal Order of Eagles—a national social, civic, and patriotic organization—the State selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state organization that maintains the capitol grounds.  Petitioner, an Austin resident who encounters the monument during his frequent visits to those grounds, brought this 42 U. S. C. §1983 suit seeking a declaration that the monument’s placement violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause and an injunction requiring its removal.  Holding that the monument did not contravene the Clause, the District Court found that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the Eagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency, and that a reasonable observer, mindful of history, purpose, and context, would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message that the State endorsed religion.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.   
 Held:  The judgment is affirmed. 
 351 F. 3d 173, affirmed. 
    The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas, concluded that the Establishment Clause allows the display of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds.  Reconciling the strong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout our Nation’s history, see  School Dist. of Abington Township  v.  Schempp,   374 U. S. 203 , 212–213, with the principle that governmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom requires that the Court neither abdicate its responsibility to maintain a division between church and state nor evince a hostility to religion,  e.g., Zorach  v.  Clauson ,  343 U. S. 306 , 313–314.  While the Court has sometimes pointed to  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman ,  403 U. S. 602 , for the governing test,  Lemon  is not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument that Texas has erected on its capitol grounds.  Instead, the analysis should be driven by both the monument’s nature and the Nation’s history.  From at least 1789, there has been an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of religion’s role in American life.   Lynch  v.  Donnelly,  465 U. S. 668 , 674.  Texas’ display of the Commandments on government property is typical of such acknowledgments.  Representations of the Commandments appear throughout this Court and its grounds, as well as the Nation’s Capital.  Moreover, the Court’s opinions, like its building, have recognized the role the Decalogue plays in America’s heritage.  See,  e.g. ,  McGowan  v.  Maryland,   366 U. S. 420 , 442, 462.  While the Commandments are religious, they have an undeniable historical meaning.  Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause.  See,  e.g., Lynch  v.  Donnelly, supra , at 680, 687.  There are, of course, limits to the government’s display of religious messages or symbols.  For example, this Court held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public schoolroom.   Stone  v.  Graham,   449 U. S. 39 , 41–42.  However, neither  Stone  itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that  Stone ’s holding would extend beyond the context of public schools to a legislative chamber, see  Marsh  v.  Chambers,  463 U. S. 783 , or to capitol grounds.  Texas’ placement of the Commandments monument on its capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in  Stone,  where the text confronted elementary school students every day.  Indeed, petitioner here apparently walked by the monument for years before bringing this suit.   Schempp, supra,  and  Lee  v.  Weisman ,  505 U. S. 577 , distinguished.  Texas has treated her capitol grounds monuments as representing several strands in the State’s political and legal history.  The inclusion of the Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government, that cannot be said to violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp. 3–12.  
 

   Justice Breyer concluded that this is a difficult borderline case where none of the Court’s various tests for evaluating Establishment Clause questions can substitute for the exercise of legal judgment.  See,  e.g., School Dist. of Abington Township  v.  Schempp,   374 U. S. 203 , 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring).  That judgment is not a personal judgment.  Rather, as in all constitutional cases, it must reflect and remain faithful to the underlying purposes of the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses—to assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all, to avoid the religious divisiveness that promotes social conflict, and to maintain the separation of church and state.  No exact formula can dictate a resolution to fact-intensive cases such as this.  Despite the Commandments’ religious message, an inquiry into the context in which the text of the Commandments is used demonstrates that the Commandments also convey a secular moral message about proper standards of social conduct and a message about the historic relation between those standards and the law.  The circumstances surrounding the monument’s placement on the capitol grounds and its physical setting provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments’ text as used on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message.  The determinative factor here, however, is that 40 years passed in which the monument’s presence, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner).  Those 40 years  suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their belief systems, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to establish religion.  See  ibid.   The public visiting the capitol grounds is more likely to have considered the religious aspect of the tablets’ message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.  For these reasons, the Texas display falls on the permissible side of the constitutional line.  Pp. 1–8.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 McCREARY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al.  v . AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
 No. 03–1693.Argued March 2, 2005—Decided June 27, 2005 
 After petitioners, two Kentucky Counties, each posted large, readily visible copies of the Ten Commandments in their courthouses, respondents, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) et al., sued under 42 U. S. C. §1983 to enjoin the displays on the ground that they violated the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.  The Counties then adopted nearly identical resolutions calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentucky’s  “precedent legal code.”  The resolutions noted several grounds for taking that position, including the state legislature’s acknowledgment of Christ as the “Prince of Ethics.”  The displays around the Commandments were modified to include eight smaller, historical documents containing religious references as their sole common element,  e.g.,  the Declaration of Independence’s “endowed by their Creator” passage.  Entering a preliminary injunction, the District Court followed the  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,   403 U. S. 602 , test to find,  inter alia , that the original display lacked any secular purpose because the Commandments are a distinctly religious document, and that the second version lacked such a purpose because the Counties narrowly tailored their selection of foundational documents to those specifically referring to Christianity.  After changing counsel, the Counties revised the exhibits again.  No new resolution authorized the new exhibits, nor did the Counties repeal the resolutions that preceded the second one.  The new posting, entitled “The Foundations of American Law and Government Display,” consists of nine framed documents of equal size.  One sets out the Commandments explicitly identified as the “King James Version,” quotes them at greater length, and explains that they have profoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and this Nation.  With the Commandments are framed copies of,  e.g.,  the Star Spangled Banner’s lyrics and the Declaration of Independence, accompanied by statements about their historical and legal significance.  On the ACLU’s motion, the District Court included this third display in the injunction despite the Counties’ professed intent to show that the Commandments were part of the foundation of American Law and Government and to educate County citizens as to the documents.  The court took proclaiming the Commandments’ foundational value as a religious, rather than secular, purpose under  Stone  v.  Graham,   449 U. S. 39 , and found that the Counties’ asserted educational goals crumbled upon an examination of this litigation’s history.  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit stressed that, under  Stone , displaying the Commandments bespeaks a religious object unless they are integrated with a secular message.  The court saw no integration here because of a lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical connection between the Commandments and the other documents.   
 Held:  
    1. A determination of the Counties’ purpose is a sound basis for ruling on the Establishment Clause complaints.  The Counties’ objective may be dispositive of the constitutional enquiry.  Pp. 10–19.

WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC. V. FEDERAL ELECTIONCOMM'N 
546 U. S. ____ (2006) 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC., APPELLANT  v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION 
 on appeal from the united states district court for
the district of columbia 
 [January 23, 2006] 
    Per Curiam. 
 
   The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), §203, 116 Stat. 91, prohibits corporations from using their general treasury funds to pay for any “electioneering communications.”  2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. III).  BCRA §201 defines “electioneering communications” as any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a candidate for federal office and that is broadcast within 30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal general election in the jurisdiction in which that candidate is running for office.  2 U. S. C. §434(f)(3).  Appellant Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL) brought this action against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking a judgment declaring BCRA unconstitutional as applied to several broadcast advertisements that it intended to run during the 2004 election.  WRTL also sought a preliminary injunction barring the FEC from enforcing BCRA against those advertisements. WRTL does not dispute that its advertisements are covered by BCRA’s definition of prohibited electioneering communications.  Instead, it contends that BCRA cannot be constitutionally applied to its particular communications because they constitute “grassroots lobbying advertisements.”  Although the FEC has statutory authority to exempt by regulation certain communications from BCRA’s prohibition on electioneering communications, §434(f)(3)(B)(iv), at this point, it has not done so for the types of advertisements at issue here.    
 

   The three-judge District Court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and subsequently dismissed WRTL’s complaint in an unpublished opinion.  We noted probable jurisdiction, 545 U. S. ___ (2005).  Appellant asks us to reverse the judgment of the District Court because that court incorrectly read a footnote in our opinion in  McConnell  v.  Federal Election Comm’n,   540 U. S. 93 , (2003), as foreclosing any “as-applied” challenges to the prohibition on electioneering communications.  We agree with WRTL that the District Court misinterpreted the relevance of our “uphold[ing] all applications of the primary definition” of electioneering communications.   Id ., at 190, n. 73.  Contrary to the understanding of the District Court, that footnote merely notes that because we found BCRA’s primary definition of “electioneering communication” facially valid when used with regard to BCRA’s disclosure and funding requirements, it was unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of the backup definition Congress provided.   Ibid .  In upholding §203 against a facial challenge, we did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges. 
 

   The FEC argues that the District Court also rested its decision on the alternative ground that the facts of this case “suggest that WRTL’s advertisements may fit the very type of activity  McConnell  found Congress had a compelling interest in regulating.”  No. 04–1260 (DC, Aug. 17, 2004), App. to Juris. Statement 8a.  It is not clear to us, however, that the District Court intended its opinion to rest on this ground.  For one thing, the court used the word “may.”  For another, its separate opinion dismissing WRTL’s challenge with prejudice characterized its previous opinion as holding that “WRTL’s ‘as-applied’ challenge to BCRA is foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s decision in  McConnell .”   Id.,  at 3a.  Given this ambiguity, we cannot say with certainty that the District Court’s dismissal was based on this alternative ground. 
 

   We therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL’s as-applied challenge in the first instance. 
 It is so ordered.

GONZALES V. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTEUNIAO DO VEGETAL 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.  v . O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE UNIAO DO
VEGETAL et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
 No. 04–1084. Argued November 1, 2005—Decided February 21, 2006 
 Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) in response to  Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.  v.  Smith,   494 U. S. 872 , where, in upholding a generally applicable law that burdened the sacramental use of peyote, this Court held that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause does not require judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious burdens imposed by facially constitutional laws,  id.,  at 883–890.  Among other things, RFRA prohibits the Federal Government from substantially burdening a person’s exercise of religion, “even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,” 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–1(a), except when the Government can “demonstrat[e] that application of the burden to the person (1) [furthers] a compelling government interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that … interest,” §2000bb–1(b). 
 

      Members of respondent church (UDV) receive communion by drinking  hoasca,  a tea brewed from plants unique to the Amazon Rainforest that contains DMT, a hallucinogen regulated under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, see 21 U. S. C. §812(c), Schedule I(c).  After U. S. Customs inspectors seized a  hoasca  shipment to the American UDV and threatened prosecution, the UDV filed this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging,  inter alia,  that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV’s sacramental  hoasca  use violates RFRA.  At a hearing on the UDV’s preliminary injunction motion, the Government conceded that the challenged application would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion, but argued that this burden did not violate RFRA because applying the Controlled Substances Act was the least restrictive means of advancing three compelling governmental interests: protecting UDV members’ health and safety, preventing the diversion of  hoasca  from the church to recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  The District Court granted relief, concluding that, because the parties’ evidence on health risks and diversion was equally balanced, the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying the substantial burden on the UDV.  The court also held that the 1971 Convention does not apply to  hoasca .  The Tenth Circuit affirmed.   
 Held:  The courts below did not err in determining that the Government failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compelling interest in barring the UDV’s sacramental use of  hoasca .  Pp. 6–19. 
    1. This Court rejects the Government’s argument that evidentiary equipoise as to potential harm and diversion is an insufficient basis for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.  Given that the Government conceded the UDV’s prima facie RFRA case in the District Court and that the evidence found to be in equipoise related to an affirmative defense as to which the Government bore the burden of proof, the UDV effectively demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  The Government’s argument that, although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a compelling interest at trial on the merits, the UDV should have borne the burden of disproving such interests at the preliminary injunction hearing is foreclosed by  Ashcroft  v.  American Civil Liberties Union,   542 U. S. 656 , 666.  There, in affirming the grant of a preliminary injunction against the Government, this Court reasoned that the burdens with respect to the compelling interest test at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.  The Government’s attempt to limit the  Ashcroft  rule to content-based restrictions on speech is unavailing.  The fact that  Ashcroft  involved such a restriction in no way affected the Court’s assessment of the consequences of having the burden at trial for preliminary injunction purposes.  Congress’ express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in the same way as the test’s constitutionally mandated applications, including at the preliminary injunction stage.  Pp. 6–8. 
 

   2. Also rejected is the Government’s central submission that, because it has a compelling interest in the  uniform  application of the Controlled Substances Act, no exception to the DMT ban can be made to accommodate the UDV.  The Government argues,  inter alia,  that the Act’s description of Schedule I substances as having “a high potential for abuse,” “no currently accepted medical use,” and “a lack of accepted safety for use … under medical supervision,” 21 U. S. C. §812(b)(1), by itself precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions, and that the Act’s “closed” regulatory system, which prohibits all use of controlled substances except as the Act itself authorizes, see  Gonzales  v.  Raich,  545 U. S. ___, ___, cannot function properly if subjected to judicial exemptions.  Pp. 8–16. 
 

      (a) RFRA and its strict scrutiny test contemplate an inquiry more focused than the Government’s categorical approach.  RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law “to the person”—the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.  42 U. S. C. §2000bb–1(b).  Section 2000bb(b)(1) expressly adopted the compelling interest test of  Sherbert  v.  Verner ,  374 U. S. 398 , and  Wisconsin  v.  Yoder,   406 U. S. 205 .  There, the Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates, scrutinized the asserted harms, and granted specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.   Id.,  at 213, 221, 236;  Sherbert, supra,  at 410.  Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted that “[c]ontext matters” in applying the compelling interest test,  Grutter  v.  Bollinger,  539 U. S. 306 , 327, and has emphasized that strict scrutiny’s fundamental purpose is to take  “relevant differences” into account,  Adarand Constructors, Inc.  v.  Pe&nacutea,   515 U. S. 200 , 228.  Pp. 9–10. 
 

      (b) Under RFRA’s more focused inquiry, the Government’s mere invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances cannot carry the day.  Although Schedule I substances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous, see,  e.g.,   Touby  v.  United States,   500 U. S. 160 , 162, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue.  That question  was  litigated below.  Before the District Court found that the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing such harm, the court noted that it could not ignore the congressional classification and findings.  But Congress’ determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of the obligation to shoulder its RFRA burden.  The Controlled Substances Act’s authorization to the Attorney General to “waive the requirement for registration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health and safety,” 21 U. S. C. §822(d), reinforces that Congress’ findings with respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the determinative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to them.  Indeed, despite the fact that everything the Government says about the DMT in  hoasca  applies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote, another Schedule I substance, both the Executive and Congress have decreed an exception from the Controlled Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote, see 21 CFR §1307.31; 42 U. S. C. §1996a(b)(1).  If such use is permitted in the face of the general congressional findings for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith, those same findings alone cannot preclude consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs.  See  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.  v.  Hialeah,   508 U. S. 520 , 547.  The Government’s argument that the existence of a  congressional  exemption for peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act is amenable to  judicially crafted  exceptions fails because RFRA plainly contemplates court-recognized exceptions, see §2000bb–1(c).  Pp. 11–13. 
 

      (c) The peyote exception also fatally undermines the Government’s broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA.  The peyote exception has been in place since the Controlled Substances Act’s outset, and there is no evidence that it has undercut the Government’s ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by non-Indians.  The Government’s reliance on pre- Smith  cases asserting a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause is unavailing.  Those cases did not embrace the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a substantial burden on religious exercise, but instead scrutinized the asserted need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated.  See,  e.g., United States  v.  Lee,   455 U. S. 252 , 258, 260.  They show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling interest in uniform application of a particular program by offering evidence that granting the requested religious accommodations would seriously compromise its ability to administer the program.  Here the Government’s uniformity argument rests not so much on the particular statutory program at issue as on slippery slope concerns that could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a generally applicable law,  i.e. , “if I make an exception for you, I’ll have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions.”  But RFRA operates by mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to “rule[s] of general applicability.”  §2000bb–1(a).  Congress’ determination that the legislated test is “workable … for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests,” §200bb(a)(5), finds support in  Sherbert, supra,  at 407, and  Cutter  v.  Wilkinson,  544 U. S. ___, ___.  While there may be instances where a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA, it would be surprising to find that this was such a case, given the longstanding peyote exemption and the fact that the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision denying a claimed right to sacramental use of a controlled substance.  The Government has not shown that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in,  e.g.,   Lee .  It cannot now compensate for its failure to convince the District Court as to its health or diversion concerns with the bold argument that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Controlled Substances Act.  Pp. 13–16. 
 

   3. The Government argues unpersuasively that it has a compelling interest in complying with the 1971 U. N. Convention.  While this Court does not agree with the District Court that the Convention does not cover  hoasca,  that does not automatically mean that the Government has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the UDV’s sacramental use.  At this stage, it suffices that the Government did not submit any evidence addressing the international consequences of granting the UDV an exemption, but simply relied on two affidavits by State Department officials attesting to the general (and undoubted) importance of honoring international obligations and maintaining the United States’ leadership in the international war on drugs.  Under RFRA, invocation of such general interests, standing alone, is not enough.  Pp. 16–18.   
 389 F. 3d 973, affirmed and remanded. 
    Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Alito, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

RUMSFELD V. FORUM FOR ACADEMIC AND INSTITU-TIONAL RIGHTS, INC. 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, et al.  v .
FORUM FOR ACADEMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, INC., et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
 No. 04–1152. Argued December 6, 2005—Decided March 6, 2006 
 Respondent Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), is an association of law schools and law faculties, whose members have policies opposing discrimination based on,  inter alia,  sexual orientation.  They would like to restrict military recruiting on their campuses because they object to the Government’s policy on homosexuals in the military, but the Solomon Amendment—which provides that educational institutions denying military recruiters access equal to that provided other recruiters will lose certain federal funds—forces them to choose between enforcing their nondiscrimination policy against military recruiters and continuing to receive those funds.  In 2003, FAIR sought a preliminary injunction against enforcement of an earlier version of the Solomon Amendment, arguing that forced inclusion and equal treatment of military recruiters violated its members’ First Amendment freedoms of speech and association.  Denying relief on the ground that FAIR had not established a likelihood of success on the merits, the District Court concluded that recruiting is conduct, not speech, and thus Congress could regulate any expressive aspect of the military’s conduct under  United States  v.  O’Brien,   391 U. S. 367 .  The District Court, however, questioned the Department of Defense (DOD) interpretation of the Solomon Amendment, under which law schools must provide recruiters access at least equal to that provided other recruiters.  Congress responded to this concern by codifying the DOD’s policy.  Reversing the District Court’s judgment, the Third Circuit concluded that the amended Solomon Amendment violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine by forcing a law school to choose between surrendering First Amendment rights and losing federal funding for its university.  The court did not think that  O’Brien  applied, but nonetheless determined that, if the activities were expressive conduct rather than speech, the Solomon Amendment was also unconstitutional under that decision. 
 Held:  Because Congress could require law schools to provide equal access to military recruiters without violating the schools’ freedoms of speech and association, the Third Circuit erred in holding that the Solomon Amendment likely violates the First Amendment.  Pp. 5–21. 
    1. The Solomon Amendment should be read the way both the Government and FAIR interpret it: In order for a law school and its university to receive federal funding, the law school must offer military recruiters the same access to its campus and students that it provides to the nonmilitary recruiter receiving the most favorable access.  Contrary to the argument of  amici  law professors, a school excluding military recruiters could not comply with the Solomon Amendment by also excluding any other recruiter that violates its nondiscrimination policy.  The Secretary of Defense must compare the military’s “access to campuses” and “to students” to “the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer.”  10 U. S. C. A. §983.  The statute does not focus on the content of a school’s recruiting policy, but on the result achieved by the policy.  Applying the same policy to all recruiters does not comply with the statute if it results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the military.  This interpretation is supported by the text of the statute and is necessary to give effect to the Solomon Amendment’s recent revision.  Pp. 5–8. 
 

   2. Under the Solomon Amendment, a university must allow equal access for military recruiters in order to receive certain federal funds.  Although there are limits on Congress’ ability to condition the receipt of funds, see,  e.g.,   United States  v.  American Library Assn., Inc.,  539 U. S. 194 , 210, a funding condition cannot be unconstitutional if it could be constitutionally imposed directly.  Because the First Amendment would not prevent Congress from directly imposing the Solomon Amendment’s access requirement, the statute does not place an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal funds.  Pp. 8–20. 
 

      (a) As a general matter, the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech.  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals concluded that the statute violates law schools’ freedom of speech in a number of ways.  First, the law schools must provide military recruiters with some assistance clearly involving speech, such as sending e-mails and distributing flyers, if they provide such services to other recruiters.  This speech is subject to First Amendment scrutiny, but the compelled speech here is plainly incidental to the statute’s regulation of conduct.  Compelling a law school that sends e-mails for other recruiters to send one for a military recruiter is simply not the same as forcing a student to pledge allegiance to the flag,  West Virginia Bd. of Ed.  v.  Barnette,   319 U. S. 624 , or forcing a Jehovah’s Witness to display a particular motto on his license plate,  Wooley  v.  Maynard,   430 U. S. 705 , and it trivializes the freedom protected in  Barnette  and  Wooley  to suggest that it is. 
 

   Second, that military recruiters are, to some extent, speaking while on campus does not mean that the Solomon Amendment unconstitutionally requires laws schools to accommodate the military’s message by including those recruiters in interviews and recruiting receptions.  This Court has found compelled-speech violations where the complaining speaker’s own message was affected by the speech it was forced to accommodate.  See,  e.g., Hurley  v.  Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,   515 U. S. 557 , 566.  Here, however, the schools are not speaking when they host interviews and recruiting receptions.  They facilitate recruiting to assist their students in obtaining jobs.  Thus, a law school’s recruiting services lack the expressive quality of, for example ,  the parade in  Hurley.   Nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree with any speech by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon Amendment restricts what they may say about the military’s policies. 
 

   Third, freedom of speech can be violated by expressive conduct, but the expressive nature of the conduct regulated by the Solomon Amendment does not bring that conduct within the First Amendment’s protection.  Unlike flag burning, see  Texas  v.  Johnson,   491 U. S. 397 , the conduct here is not so inherently expressive that it warrants protection under  O’Brien.   Before adoption of the Solomon Amendment’s equal-access requirement, law schools expressed their disagreement with the military by treating military recruiters differently from other recruiters.  These actions were expressive not because of the conduct but because of the speech that accompanied that conduct.  Moreover, even if the Solomon Amendment were regarded as regulating expressive conduct, it would be constitutional under  O’Brien .  Pp. 8–18. 
 

      (b) The Solomon Amendment also does not violate the law schools’ freedom of expressive association.  Unlike  Boy Scouts of America  v.  Dale,   530 U. S. 640 , where the Boy Scouts’ freedom of expressive association was violated when a state law required the organization to accept a homosexual scoutmaster, the statute here does not force a law school “ ‘to accept members it does not desire,’ ”  id.,  at 648.  Law schools “associate” with military recruiters in the sense that they interact with them, but recruiters are not part of the school.  They are outsiders who come onto campus for the limited purpose of trying to hire students—not to become members of the school’s expressive association.  The freedom of expressive association protects more than a group’s membership decisions, reaching activities that affect a group’s ability to express its message by making group membership less attractive.  But the Solomon Amendment has no similar effect on a law school’s associational rights.  Students and faculty are free to associate to voice their disapproval of the military’s message; nothing about the statute affects the composition of the group by making membership less desirable.  Pp. 18–20. 
 390 F. 3d 219, reversed and remanded. 
    Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Alito, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

HARTMAN V. MOORE 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 HARTMAN et al.  v . MOORE 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
 No. 04–1495. Argued January 10, 2006—Decided April 26, 2006 
 Seeking to convince the United States Postal Service to incorporate multiline optical scanning technology, a company (REI), which manufactured multiline optical readers, commenced an extensive lobbying and public-relations campaign.  In the end, the Postal Service begrudgingly embraced the multiline technology, but awarded the lucrative equipment contract to a competing firm.  Subsequently, Postal Service inspectors investigated REI and its chief executive, respondent Moore, for their alleged involvement in a consulting-firm kickback scandal and for their alleged improper role in the search for a new Postmaster General.  Urged at least in part by the inspectors to bring criminal charges, a federal prosecutor tried REI and its top officials.  But, finding a complete lack of evidence connecting them to any wrongdoing, the District Court acquitted the defendants.  Moore then filed an action under  Bivens  v.  Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,   403 U. S. 388 , against the federal prosecutor and petitioner postal inspectors, arguing, as relevant here, that they had engineered the prosecution in retaliation for his lobbying efforts.  The claims against the prosecutor were dismissed in accordance with the absolute immunity for prosecutorial judgment.  Ultimately, the entire suit was dismissed, but the Court of Appeals reinstated the retaliatory-prosecution claim against the inspectors.  Back in District Court, the inspectors moved for summary judgment, claiming that because the underlying criminal charges were supported by probable cause they were entitled to qualified immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.   
 Held:  A plaintiff in a retaliatory-prosecution action must plead and show the absence of probable cause for pressing the underlying criminal charges.  Pp. 5–15. 
    (a) As a general matter, this Court has held that the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions, including criminal prosecutions, for speaking out.   Crawford-El  v.  Britton,   523 U. S. 574 , 592.  When nonretaliatory grounds are insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences, retaliation is subject to recovery as the but-for cause of official injurious action offending the Constitution, see,  e.g.,   id.,  at 593, and a vengeful federal officer is subject to damages under  Bivens.   Pp. 5–6. 
 

   (b) Although a  Bivens  (or 42 U. S. C. §1983) plaintiff must show a causal connection between a defendant’s retaliatory animus and subsequent injury in any retaliation action, the need to demonstrate causation in the retaliatory-prosecution context presents an additional difficulty which can be overcome by a showing of the absence of probable cause.  In an ordinary retaliation case, the evidence of motive and injury are sufficient for a circumstantial demonstration that the one caused the other, and the causation is understood to be but-for causation, without which the adverse action would not have been taken.  When the claimed retaliation is, however, a criminal charge, the action will differ in two ways.  First, evidence showing whether there was probable cause for the criminal charge will be highly valuable circumstantial evidence to prove or disprove retaliatory causation.  Demonstrating a lack of probable cause will tend to reinforce the retaliation evidence and show that retaliation was the but-for basis for instigating the prosecution, while establishing the existence of probable cause will suggest that the prosecution would have occurred even without a retaliatory motive.  Second, since the defendant in a retaliatory-prosecution case will not be the prosecutor, who has immunity, but an official who allegedly influenced the prosecutorial decision, the causal connection required is not between the retaliatory animus of one person and that person’s own injurious action, as it is in the ordinary retaliation case, but between the retaliatory animus of one person and the adverse action of another.  Because evidence of an inspector’s animus does not necessarily show that the inspector induced the prosecutor to act when he would not have pressed charges otherwise and because of the longstanding presumption of regularity accorded prosecutorial decisionmaking, a showing of the absence of probable cause is needed to bridge the gap between the nonprosecuting government agent’s retaliatory motive and the prosecutor’s injurious action and to rebut the presumption.  Pp. 6–13. 
 

   (c) The significance of probable cause or the lack of it looms large, being a potential feature of every case, with obvious evidentiary value.   Though not necessarily dispositive, the absence of probable cause along with a retaliatory motive on the part of the official urging prosecution are reasonable grounds to suspend the presumption of regularity behind the charging decision and enough for a prima facie inference that the unconstitutionally motivated inducement infected the prosecutor’s decision to go forward.  Pp. 13–15.

GARCETTI V. CEBALLOS 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 GARCETTI et al.  v . CEBALLOS 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 04–473. Argued October 12, 2005—Reargued March 21, 2006—Decided May 30, 2006 
 Respondent Ceballos, a supervising deputy district attorney, was asked by defense counsel to review a case in which, counsel claimed, the affidavit police used to obtain a critical search warrant was inaccurate.  Concluding after the review that the affidavit made serious misrepresentations, Ceballos relayed his findings to his supervisors, petitioners here, and followed up with a disposition memorandum recommending dismissal.  Petitioners nevertheless proceeded with the prosecution.  At a hearing on a defense motion to challenge the warrant, Ceballos recounted his observations about the affidavit, but the trial court rejected the challenge.  Claiming that petitioners then retaliated against him for his memo in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Ceballos filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 suit.  The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, ruling,  inter alia,  that the memo was not protected speech because Ceballos wrote it pursuant to his employment duties.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that the memo’s allegations were protected under the First Amendment analysis in  Pickering  v.  Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,   391 U. S. 563 , and  Connick  v.  Myers,   461 U. S. 138 .   
 Held:  When public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, they are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.  Pp. 5–14. 
    (a) Two inquiries guide interpretation of the constitutional protections accorded public employee speech.  The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  See  Pickering, supra,  at 568.  If the answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment cause of action based on the employer’s reaction to the speech.  See  Connick ,  supra , at 147.  If the answer is yes, the possibility of a First Amendment claim arises.  The question becomes whether the government employer had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.  See  Pickering, supra , at 568.  This consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speaker’s expressions and employment.  Without a significant degree of control over its employees’ words and actions, a government employer would have little chance to provide public services efficiently.  Cf.  Connick ,  supra , at 143.  Thus, a government entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its employer role, but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has some potential to affect its operations.  On the other hand, a citizen who works for the government is nonetheless still a citizen.  The First Amendment limits a public employer’s ability to leverage the employment relationship to restrict, incidentally or intentionally, the liberties employees enjoy in their capacities as private citizens.  See  Perry  v.  Sindermann,   408 U. S. 593 , 597.  So long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.  See,  e.g. ,  Connick ,  supra , at 147.  Pp. 5–8. 
 

   (b) Proper application of the Court’s precedents leads to the conclusion that the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee’s expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.  Because Ceballos’ memo falls into this category, his allegation of unconstitutional retaliation must fail.  The dispositive factor here is not that Ceballos expressed his views inside his office, rather than publicly, see,  e.g. ,  Givhan  v.  Western Line Consol. School Dist.,   439 U. S. 410 , 414, nor that the memo concerned the subject matter of his employment, see,  e.g. ,  Pickering,  391 U. S. at 573.  Rather, the controlling factor is that Ceballos’ expressions were made pursuant to his official duties.  That consideration distinguishes this case from those in which the First Amendment provides protection against discipline.  Ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he was employed to do.  He did not act as a citizen by writing it.  The fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean his supervisors were prohibited from evaluating his performance.  Restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee’s professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.  It simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created.  Cf.  Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,   515 U. S. 819 , 833.  This result is consistent with the Court’s prior emphasis on the potential societal value of employee speech and on affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations.  Ceballos’ proposed contrary rule, adopted by the Ninth Circuit, would commit state and federal courts to a new, permanent, and intrusive role, mandating judicial oversight of communications between and among government employees and their superiors in the course of official business.  This displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision finds no support in the Court’s precedents. The doctrinal anomaly the Court of Appeals perceived in compelling public employers to tolerate certain employee speech made publicly but not speech made pursuant to an employee’s assigned duties misconceives the theoretical underpinnings of this Court’s decisions and is unfounded as a practical matter.  Pp. 8–13. 
 

   (c) Exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable significance, and various measures have been adopted to protect employees and provide checks on supervisors who would order unlawful or otherwise inappropriate actions.  These include federal and state whistle-blower protection laws and labor codes and, for government attorneys, rules of conduct and constitutional obligations apart from the First Amendment.  However, the Court’s precedents do not support the existence of a constitutional cause of action behind every statement a public employee makes in the course of doing his or her job.  Pp. 13–14. 
 361 F. 3d 1168, reversed and remanded.

RANDALL V. SORRELL 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 RANDALL et al.  v . SORRELL et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
 No. 04–1528. Argued February 28, 2006—Decided June 26, 2006 
 Vermont’s Act 64 stringently limits both the amounts that candidates for state office may spend on their campaigns and the amounts that individuals, organizations, and political parties may contribute to those campaigns.  Soon after Act 64 became law, the petitioners—individuals who have run for state office, citizens who vote in state elections and contribute to campaigns, and political parties and committees participating in state politics—brought this suit against the respondents, state officials charged with enforcing the Act.  The District Court held that Act 64’s expenditure limits violate the First Amendment, see  Buckley  v.  Valeo,   424 U. S. 1 , and that the Act’s limits on political parties’ contributions to candidates were unconstitutional, but found the other contribution limits constitutional.  The Second Circuit held that  all  of the Act’s contribution limits are constitutional, ruled that the expenditure limits may be constitutional because they are supported by compelling interests in preventing corruption or its appearance and in limiting the time state officials must spend raising campaign funds, and remanded for the District Court to determine whether the expenditure limits were narrowly tailored to those interests. 
 Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded. 
 382 F. 3d 91, reversed and remanded. 
    Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded in Parts I, II–B–3, III, and IV that both of Act 64’s sets of limitations are inconsistent with the First Amendment.  Pp. 6–8, 10–29. 
 

   1. The expenditure limits violate the First Amendment’s free speech guarantees under  Buckley.   Pp. 6–8, 10–11. 
 

      (a) In  Buckley,  the Court held,  inter alia , that the Government’s asserted interest in preventing “corruption and the appearance of corruption,” 424 U. S., at 25, provided sufficient justification for the contribution limitations imposed on campaigns for federal office by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971,  id.,  at 23–38, but that FECA’s expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment,  id.,  at 39–59.  The Court explained that the difference between the two kinds of limitations is that expenditure limits “impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than” do contribution limits.   Id. , at 23.  Contribution limits, though a “marginal restriction,” nevertheless leave the contributor “fre[e] to discuss candidates and issues.”   Id. , at 20–21.  Expenditure limits, by contrast, impose “[a] restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication,”  id. , at 19, and thereby necessarily “reduc[e] the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached,”  ibid.   For over 30 years, in considering the constitutionality of a host of campaign finance statutes, this Court has adhered to  Buckley ’s constraints, including those on expenditure limits.  See,  e.g., McConnell  v.  Federal Election Comm’n,   540 U. S. 93 , 134.  Pp. 6–8. 
 

      (b) The respondents argue unpersuasively that  Buckley  should be distinguished from the present cases on a ground they say  Buckley  did not consider: that expenditure limits help to protect candidates from spending too much time raising money rather than devoting that time to campaigning among ordinary voters.  There is no significant basis for that distinction.  Act 64’s expenditure limits are not substantially different from those at issue in  Buckley.   Nor is Vermont’s primary justification for imposing its expenditure limits significantly different from Congress’ rationale for the  Buckley  limits: preventing corruption and its appearance.  The respondents say unpersuasively that, had the  Buckley  Court considered the time protection rationale for expenditure limits, the Court would have upheld those limits in the FECA.  The  Buckley  Court, however, was aware of the connection between expenditure limits and a reduction in fundraising time.  And, in any event, the connection seems perfectly obvious.  Under these circumstances, the respondents’ argument amounts to no more than an invitation so to limit  Buckley’s  holding   as effectively to overrule it.  That invitation is declined.  Pp. 10–11. 
 

   2. Act 64’s contribution limits violate the First Amendment because those limits, in their specific details, burden protected interests in a manner disproportionate to the public purposes they were enacted to advance.  Pp. 11–29. 
 

      (a) In upholding the $1,000 contribution limit before it, the  Buckley  Court recognized,  inter alia,  that such limits, unlike expenditure limits, “involv[e] little direct restraint on” the contributor’s speech, 424 U. S., at 21, and are permissible as long as the government demonstrates that they are “closely drawn” to match a “sufficiently important interest,”  id. , at 25.  It found that the interest there advanced, “prevent[ing] corruption” and its “appearance,” was “sufficiently important” to justify the contribution limits,  id. , at 25–26, and that those limits were “closely drawn.”  Although recognizing that, in determining whether a particular contribution limit was “closely drawn,” the amount, or level, of that limit could make a difference, see  id. , at 21, the Court added that such “distinctions in degree become significant only when they … amount to differences in kind,”  id. , at 30.  Pointing out that it had “no scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000,”  ibid.,  the Court found “no indication” that FECA’s contribution limitations would have “any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns,”  id. , at 21.  Since  Buckley , the Court has consistently upheld contribution limits in other statutes, but has recognized that such limits might  sometimes  work more harm to protected First Amendment interests than their anticorruption objectives could justify, see,  e.g., Nixon  v.  Shrink Missouri Government PAC,  528 U. S. 377 , 395–397.  Pp. 12–13.  
 

      (b) Although the Court has “no scalpel to probe,” 424 U. S., at 30, with exactitude whether particular contribution limits are too low and normally defers to the legislature in that regard, it must nevertheless recognize the existence of some lower bound, as  Buckley  acknowledges.  While the interests served by contribution limits, preventing corruption and its appearance, “directly implicate the integrity of our electoral process,”  McConnell, supra,  at 136, that does not simply mean the lower the limit, the better.  Contribution limits that are too low also can harm the electoral process by preventing challengers from mounting effective campaigns against incumbent officeholders, thereby reducing democratic accountability.  Where there is strong indication in a particular case,  i.e. , danger signs, that such risks exist (both present in kind and likely serious in degree), courts, including appellate courts, must review the record independently and carefully with an eye toward assessing the statute’s “tailoring,”  i.e.,  toward assessing the restrictions’ proportionality.  See  Bose Corp.  v.  Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,   466 U. S. 485 , 499.  Danger signs that Act 64’s contribution limits may fall outside tolerable First Amendment limits are present here.  They are substantially lower than both the limits the Court has previously upheld and the comparable limits in force in other States.  Consequently, the record must be examined to determine whether Act 64’s contribution limits are “closely drawn” to match the State’s interests.  Pp. 13–19.  
 

      (c) The record demonstrates that, from a constitutional perspective, Act 64’s contribution limits are too restrictive.  Five sets of factors, taken together, lead to the conclusion that those limits are not narrowly tailored.   First,  the record suggests, though it does not conclusively prove, that Act 64’s contribution limits will significantly restrict the amount of funding available for challengers to run competitive campaigns.   Second,  Act 64’s insistence that a political party and all of its affiliates together abide by  exactly  the same low $200 to $400 contribution limits that apply to individual contributors threatens harm to a particularly important political right, the right to associate in a political party.  See,  e.g. ,  California Democratic Party  v.  Jones ,  530 U. S. 567 , 574.  Although the Court upheld federal limits on political parties’ contributions to candidates in  Federal Election Comm’n  v.  Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,  533 U. S. 431 , the limits there at issue were far less problematic, for they were significantly higher than Act 64’s limits, see,  e.g., id. , at 438–439, and n. 3, and they were much higher than the federal limits on contributions from individuals to candidates, see  id. , at 453.   Third,  Act 64’s treatment of volunteer services aggravates the problem.  Although the Act excludes uncompensated volunteer services from its “contribution” definition, it does not exclude the expenses volunteers incur,  e.g.,  travel expenses, in the course of campaign activities.  The combination of very low contribution limits and the absence of an exception excluding volunteer expenses may well impede a campaign’s ability effectively to use volunteers, thereby making it more difficult for individuals to associate in this way.  Cf.  Buckley, supra,  at 22.   Fourth,  unlike the contribution limits upheld in  Shrink,  Act 64’s limits are not adjusted for inflation, but decline in real value each year.  A failure to index limits means that limits already suspiciously low will almost inevitably become too low over time.   Fifth,  nowhere in the record is there any special justification for Act 64’s low and restrictive contribution limits.  Rather, the basic justifications the State has advanced in support of such limits are those present in  Buckley.   Indeed, other things being equal, one might reasonably believe that a contribution of, say, $250 (or $450) to a candidate’s campaign was less likely to prove a corruptive force than the far larger contributions at issue in the other campaign finance cases the Court has considered.  Pp. 19–28. 
 

      (d) It is not possible to sever some of the Act’s contribution limit provisions from others that might remain fully operative.  Doing so would require the Court to write words into the statute (inflation indexing), to leave gaping loopholes (no limits on party contributions), or to foresee which of many different possible ways the Vermont Legislature might respond to the constitutional objections to Act 64.  In these circumstances, the legislature likely would not have intended the Court to set aside the statute’s contribution limits.  The legislature is free to rewrite those provisions to address the constitutional difficulties here identified.  Pp. 28–29.  
 

   Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice in Parts II–B–1 and II–B–2, rejected the respondents’ argument that  Buckley  should, in effect, be overruled because subsequent experience has shown that contribution limits alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its appearance.   Stare decisis,  the basic legal principle commanding judicial respect for a court’s earlier decisions and their rules of law, prevents the overruling of  Buckley .  Adherence to precedent is the norm; departure from it is exceptional, requiring “special justification,”  Arizona  v.  Rumsey,  467 U. S. 203 , 212, especially where, as here, the principle at issue has become settled through iteration and reiteration over a long period.  There is no special justification here.  Subsequent case law has not made  Buckley  a legal anomaly or otherwise undermined its basic legal principles.  Cf.  Dickerson  v.  United States,  530 U. S. 428 , 443.  Nor is there any demonstration that circumstances have changed so radically as to undermine  Buckley ’s   critical factual assumptions.  The respondents have not shown, for example, any dramatic increase in corruption or its appearance in Vermont; nor have they shown that expenditure limits are the only way to attack that problem.  Cf.  McConnell, supra.   Finally, overruling  Buckley  now would dramatically undermine the considerable reliance that Congress and state legislatures have placed upon it in drafting campaign finance laws.  And this Court has followed  Buckley,  upholding and applying its reasoning in later cases.  Pp. 8–10. 
 

   Justice Alito agreed that Act 64’s expenditure and contribution limits violate the First Amendment, but concluded that respondents’ backup argument asking this Court to revisit  Buckley  v.  Valeo,   424 U. S. 1 , need not be reached because they have failed to address considerations of  stare decisis.   Pp. 1–2. 
 

   Justice Kennedy agreed that Vermont’s limitations on campaign expenditures and contributions violate the First Amendment, but concluded that, given his skepticism regarding this Court’s campaign finance jurisprudence, see,  e.g. ,  McConnell  v.  Federal Election Comm’n,   540 U. S. 93 , 286–287, 313, it is appropriate for him to concur only in the judgment.  Pp. 1–3.  
 

   Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, agreed that Vermont’s Act 64 is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the plurality’s rationale for striking down that statute.   Buckley  v.  Valeo ,  424 U. S. 1 , provides insufficient protection to political speech, the core of the First Amendment, is therefore illegitimate and not protected by  stare decisis , and should be overruled and replaced with a standard faithful to the Amendment.  This Court erred in  Buckley  when it distinguished between contribution and expenditure limits, finding the former to be a less severe infringement on First Amendment rights.  See,  e.g., Nixon  v.  Shrink Missouri Government PAC ,  528 U. S. 377 , 410–418.  Both the contribution and expenditure restrictions of Act 64 should be subjected to strict scrutiny, which they would fail.  See,  e.g., Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.  v.  Federal Election Comm’n,   518 U. S. 604 , 640–641.  Pp. 1–10. 
    Breyer, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C. J., joined, and in which Alito, J., joined as to all but Parts II–B–1 and II–B–2.  Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  Kennedy, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined, and in which Stevens, J., joined as to Parts II and III. 
  Together with No. 04–1530,  Vermont Republican State Committee et al.  v.  Sorrell et al.,  and No. 04–1697,  Sorrell et al.  v.  Randall et al.,  also on certiorari to the same court.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 BEARD, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  v . BANKS, individually and on
behalf of all others similarly situated 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
 No. 04–1739. Argued March 27, 2006—Decided June 28, 2006 
 Pennsylvania houses its 40 most dangerous and recalcitrant inmates in a Long Term Segregation Unit (LTSU).  Inmates begin in level 2, which has the most severe restrictions, but may graduate to the less restrictive level 1.  Plaintiff-respondent Banks, a level 2 inmate, filed this federal-court action against defendant-petitioner, the Secretary of the Department of Corrections, alleging that a level 2 policy (Policy) forbidding inmates any access to newspapers, magazines, and photographs violates the First Amendment.  During discovery, Banks deposed Deputy Prison Superintendent Dickson and the parties introduced prison policy manuals and related documents into the record.  The Secretary then filed a summary judgment motion, along with a statement of undisputed facts and the deposition.  Rather than filing an opposition to the motion, Banks filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, relying on the undisputed facts, including those in the deposition.  Based on this record, the District Court granted the Secretary’s motion and denied Banks’.  Reversing the Secretary’s summary judgment award, the Third Circuit held that the prison regulation could not be supported as a matter of law.   
 Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 
 399 F. 3d 134, reversed and remanded. 
    Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter, concluded that, based on the record before this Court, prison officials have set forth adequate legal support for the Policy, and Banks has failed to show specific facts that could warrant a determination in his favor.  Pp. 5–13. 
 

   (a)  Turner  v.  Safley,   482 U. S. 78 , and  Overton  v.  Bazzetta,  539 U. S. 126 , contain the basic substantive legal standards covering this case.  While imprisonment does not automatically deprive a prisoner of constitutional protections,  Turner,  482 U. S., at 93, the Constitution sometimes permits greater restriction of such rights in a prison than it would allow elsewhere,  id.,  at 84–85.  As  Overton, supra,  at 132, pointed out, courts also owe “substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators.”  Under  Turner,  restrictive prison regulations are permissible if they are “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  482 U. S. ,  at 89.  Because this case is here on the Secretary’s summary judgment motion, the Court examines the record to determine whether he has demonstrated “the absence of a genuine issue of material fact” and his entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.  See,  e.g.,   Fed . Rule Civ. Proc. 56.  If he has, the Court determines whether Banks has “by affidavits or as otherwise provided” in Rule 56, “set forth specific facts showing … a genuine issue for trial,” Rule 56(e).  Inferences about disputed facts must be drawn in Banks’ favor, but deference must be accorded prison authorities’ views with respect to matters of professional judgment.  Pp. 5–6. 
 

   (b) The Secretary rested his motion primarily on the undisputed facts statement and Dickson’s affidavit.  The first of his justifications for the Policy—the need to motivate better behavior on the part of particularly difficult prisoners—sufficiently satisfies  Turner ’s requirements.  The statement and affidavit set forth a “ ‘valid, rational connection ’ ” between the Policy and “ ‘legitimate penological interests,’ ” 482 U. S., at 89, 95.  Dickson noted that prison authorities are limited in what they can and cannot deny or give a level 2 inmate, who has already been deprived of most privileges, and that the officials believe that the specified items are legitimate as incentives for inmate growth.  The undisputed facts statement added that the Policy encourages progress and discourages backsliding by level 1 inmates.  These statements point to evidence that the regulations serve the function identified.  The articulated connections between newspapers and magazines, the deprivation of virtually the last privilege left to an inmate, and a significant incentive to improve behavior, are logical ones.  Thus, this factor supports the Policy’s “reasonableness.”  The second, third, and fourth  Turner  factors—whether there are “alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates,”  id ., at 90; the “impact” that accommodating “the asserted constitutional right [will] have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources,”  ibid .; and whether there are “ready alternatives” for furthering the governmental interest,  ibid .—add little to the first factor’s logical rationale here.  That two of these three factors seem to favor the Policy therefore does not help the Secretary.  The real task in this case is not balancing the  Turner  factors but determining whether the Secretary’s summary judgment material shows not just a logical relation but a  reasonable  relation.  Given the deference courts must show to prison officials’ professional judgment, the material presented here is sufficient.   Overton  provides significant support for this conclusion.  In both cases, the deprivations (family visits in  Overton  and access to newspapers, magazines, and photographs here) have an important constitutional dimension; prison officials have imposed the deprivation only upon those with serious prison-behavior problems; and those officials, relying on their professional judgment, reached an experience-based conclusion that the policies help to further legitimate prison objectives.  Unless there is more, the Secretary’s supporting material brings the Policy within  Turner’ s scope.  Pp. 6–10. 
 

   (c) Although summary judgment rules gave Banks an opportunity to respond to these materials, he did not do so in the manner the rules provide.  Instead, he filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Policy fell of its own weight.  Neither the cases he cites nor the statistics he notes support his argument.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Third Circuit placed too high an evidentiary burden on the Secretary and offered too little deference to the prison officials’ judgment.  Such deference does not make it impossible for those attacking prison policies to succeed.  A prisoner may be able to marshal substantial evidence, for example through depositions, that a policy is not reasonable or that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.  And, as  Overton  noted ,  if faced with a  de facto  permanent ban involving a severe restriction, this Court might reach a different conclusion.  Pp. 10–13. 
 

   Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concluded that, using the framework set forth in Justice Thomas’ concurrence in  Overton  v.  Bazzetta,  539 U. S. 126 , 138, Pennsylvania’s prison regulations are permissible.  That framework provides the least perilous approach for resolving challenges to prison regulations and is the approach most faithful to the Constitution.  “Sentencing a criminal to a term of imprisonment may … carry with it the implied delegation to prison officials to discipline and otherwise supervise the criminal while he is incarcerated.”   Id.,  at 140, n.  A term of imprisonment in Pennsylvania includes such an implied delegation.  Inmates are subject to Department of Corrections rules and disciplinary rulings, and the challenged regulations fall with the Department’s discretion.  This conclusion is supported by the plurality’s  Turner  v.  Safley,   482 U. S. 78 , analysis.  The “history of incarceration as punishment [also] supports the view that the sentenc[e] … terminated” respondent’s unfettered right to magazines, newspapers, and photographs.   Overton,  539 U. S., at 142.  While Pennsylvania “is free to alter its definition of incarceration to include the retention” of unfettered access to such materials, it appears that the Commonwealth instead sentenced respondent against the backdrop of its traditional conception of imprisonment, which affords no such privileges.   Id.,   at 144–145.  Pp. 1–7.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 TENNESSEE SECONDARY SCHOOL ATHLETIC
ASSOCIATION  v . BRENTWOOD ACADEMY 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
 No. 06–427. Argued April 18, 2007—Decided June 21, 2007 
 Petitioner association (TSSAA) regulates interscholastic sports among its members, Tennessee public and private high schools.  TSSAA sanctioned respondent (Brentwood), one of those private schools, because its football coach sent eighth-grade boys a letter that violated TSSAA’s rule prohibiting members from using “undue influence” in recruiting middle school students for their athletic programs.  Following internal TSSAA review, Brentwood sued TSSAA and its executive director under 42 U. S. C. §1983, claiming,  inter alia,  that enforcement of the antirecruiting rule was state action violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and that TSSAA’s flawed adjudication of its appeal deprived Brentwood of due process.  The District Court granted Brentwood relief, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that TSSAA was a private voluntary association that did not act under color of state law.  This Court reversed that determination,  Brentwood Academy  v.  Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn. ,  531 U. S. 288 , and the District Court again ruled for Brentwood on remand.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the antirecruiting rule is a content-based regulation of speech that is not narrowly tailored to serve its permissible purposes and that the TSSAA board improperly considered  ex parte  evidence, thereby violating Brentwood’s due process rights.   
 Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 
 442 F. 3d 410, reversed and remanded. 
    Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II–B, III, and IV, concluding: 
 

   1. Enforcing a rule that prohibits high school coaches from recruiting middle school athletes does not violate the First Amendment.  Brentwood made a voluntary decision to join TSSAA and to abide by its antirecruiting rule.  See 531 U. S., at  291.  An athletic league’s interest in enforcing its rules may warrant curtailing the speech of its voluntary participants.  See,  e.g., Pickering  v.  Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty. ,  391 U. S. 563 , 568.  TSSAA does not have unbounded authority to condition membership on the relinquishment of constitutional rights, see  Garcetti  v.  Ceballos , 547 U. S. ___, ___, and can impose only those conditions that are necessary to managing an efficient and effective state-sponsored high school athletic league.  That necessity is obviously present here.  No empirical data is needed to credit TSSAA’s commonsense conclusion that hard-sell tactics directed at middle school students could lead to exploitation, distort competition between high school teams, and foster an environment in which athletics are prized more highly than academics.  TSSAA’s rule discourages precisely the sort of conduct that might lead to those harms, any one of which would detract from a high school sports league’s ability to operate “efficiently and effectively.”   Garcetti , 547 U. S., at ___.  Pp. 7–8. 
 

   2. TSSAA did not violate Brentwood’s due process rights.  The sanction decision was preceded by an investigation, several meetings, correspondence, the TSSAA executive director’s adverse written determination, a hearing before the director and an advisory panel, and a  de novo  review by the entire TSSAA board.  During the investigation, Brentwood was notified of all the charges against it.  At each of the hearings, it was represented by counsel and given the opportunity to adduce evidence, none of which was excluded.  The Court rejects Brentwood’s argument that its due process rights were nevertheless violated when the full TSSAA board, acting  ex parte , heard from investigators and other witnesses and considered the investigators’ notes and other evidence concerning a separate incident in which a basketball coach named King, who was not a Brentwood employee, pushed a middle school basketball star to attend Brentwood.  Even accepting the questionable holding that TSSAA’s closed-door deliberations were unconstitutional, any due process violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is unlikely the King allegations increased the severity of the penalties leveled against Brentwood.  More importantly, Brentwood’s prejudice claim rests on the unsupported premise that it would have adopted a different and more effective strategy at the board hearing had it been given an opportunity to cross-examine the investigators and review their notes.  Brentwood has identified nothing the investigators shared with the Board that Brentwood did not already know.  Pp. 8–12.

MORSE V. FREDERICK 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 MORSE et al.  v . FREDERICK 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 06–278. Argued March 19, 2007—Decided June 25, 2007 
 At a school-sanctioned and school-supervised event, petitioner Morse, the high school principal, saw students unfurl a banner stating “BONG HiTS 4 JESUS,” which she regarded as promoting illegal drug use.  Consistent with established school policy prohibiting such messages at school events, Morse directed the students to take down the banner.  When one of the students who had brought the banner to the event—respondent Frederick—refused, Morse confiscated the banner and later suspended him.  The school superintendent upheld the suspension, explaining,  inter alia , that Frederick was disciplined because his banner appeared to advocate illegal drug use in violation of school policy.  Petitioner school board also upheld the suspension.  Frederick filed suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the school board and Morse had violated his First Amendment rights.  The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, ruling that they were entitled to qualified immunity and that they had not infringed Frederick’s speech rights.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Accepting that Frederick acted during a school-authorized activity and that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, the court nonetheless found a First Amendment violation because the school punished Frederick without demonstrating that his speech threatened substantial disruption.  It also concluded that Morse was not entitled to qualified immunity because Frederick’s right to display the banner was so clearly established that a reasonable principal in Morse’s position would have understood that her actions were unconstitutional.   
 Held:  Because schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use, the school officials in this case did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending Frederick.  Pp. 5–15.  
    (a) Frederick’s argument that this is not a school speech case is rejected.  The event in question occurred during normal school hours and was sanctioned by Morse as an approved social event at which the district’s student-conduct rules expressly applied.  Teachers and administrators were among the students and were charged with supervising them.  Frederick stood among other students across the street from the school and directed his banner toward the school, making it plainly visible to most students.  Under these circumstances, Frederick cannot claim he was not at school.  Pp. 5–6.  
 

   (b) The Court agrees with Morse that those who viewed the banner would interpret it as advocating or promoting illegal drug use, in violation of school policy.  At least two interpretations of the banner’s words—that they constitute an imperative encouraging viewers to smoke marijuana or, alternatively, that they celebrate drug use—demonstrate that the sign promoted such use.  This pro-drug interpretation gains further plausibility from the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear.  Pp. 6–8.  
 

   (c) A principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.  In  Tinker  v.  Des Moines Independent Community School Dist. ,  393 U. S. 503 , the Court declared, in holding that a policy prohibiting high school students from wearing antiwar armbands violated the First Amendment,  id.,  at 504, that student expression may not be suppressed unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will “materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school,”  id.,  at 513.  The Court in  Bethel School Dist. No. 403  v.  Fraser ,  478 U. S. 675 , however, upheld the suspension of a student who delivered a high school assembly speech employing “an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor,”  id.,  at 678.  Analyzing the case under  Tinker , the lower courts had found no disruption, and therefore no basis for discipline.  478 U. S. ,  at 679–680.  This Court reversed, holding that the school was “within its permissible authority in imposing sanctions … in response to [the student’s] offensively lewd and indecent speech.”   Id.,  at 685.  Two basic principles may be distilled from  Fraser .  First, it demonstrates that “the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.”   Id.,  at 682.  Had Fraser delivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school context, he would have been protected.  See,  id.,  at 682–683.  In school, however, his First Amendment rights were circumscribed “in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.”   Tinker ,  supra,  at 506.  Second,  Fraser  established that  Tinker ’s mode of analysis is not absolute, since the  Fraser  Court did not conduct the “substantial disruption” analysis.  Subsequently, the Court has held in the Fourth Amendment context that “while children assuredly do not ‘shed their constitutional rights … at the schoolhouse gate,’ … the nature of those rights is what is appropriate for children in school,”  Vernonia School Dist. 47J  v.  Acton ,  515 U. S. 646 , 655–656, and has recognized that deterring drug use by schoolchildren is an “important—indeed, perhaps compelling” interest,  id.,  at 661.  Drug abuse by the Nation’s youth is a serious problem.  For example, Congress has declared that part of a school’s job is educating students about the dangers of drug abuse, see,  e.g.,  the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994, and petitioners and many other schools have adopted policies aimed at implementing this message.  Student speech celebrating illegal drug use at a school event, in the presence of school administrators and teachers, poses a particular challenge for school officials working to protect those entrusted to their care.  The “special characteristics of the school environment,”  Tinker,  393 U. S., at 506, and the governmental interest in stopping student drug abuse allow schools to restrict student expression that they reasonably regard as promoting such abuse.   Id.,  at 508, 509, distinguished.  Pp. 8–15.  
 439 F. 3d 1114, reversed and remanded.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N V. WISCONSIN RIGHT TOLIFE, INC. 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION  v . WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC. 
 appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia 
 No. 06–969. Argued April 25, 2007—Decided June 25, 2007 
 Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), makes it a federal crime for a corporation to use its general treasury funds to pay for any “electioneering communication,” 2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(2), which BCRA defines as any broadcast that refers to a candidate for federal office and is aired within 30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal general election in the jurisdiction where that candidate is running, §434(f)(3)(A).  In  McConnell  v.  Federal Election Comm’n,  540 U. S. 93 , this Court upheld §203 against a First Amendment facial challenge even though the section encompassed not only campaign speech, or “express advocacy” promoting a candidate’s election or defeat, but also “issue advocacy,” or speech about public issues more generally, that also mentions such a candidate.  The Court concluded there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the “functional equivalent” of express advocacy.   Id. , at 204–205, 206. 
 

      On July 26, 2004, appellee Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), began broadcasting advertisements declaring that a group of Senators was filibustering to delay and block federal judicial nominees and telling voters to contact Wisconsin Senators Feingold and Kohl to urge them to oppose the filibuster.  WRTL planned to run the ads throughout August 2004 and finance them with its general treasury funds.  Recognizing, however, that as of August 15, 30 days before the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be illegal “electioneering communication[s]” under BCRA §203, but believing that it nonetheless had a First Amendment right to broadcast them, WRTL filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that §203’s prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to the three ads in question, as well as any materially similar ads WRTL might run in the future.  Just before the BCRA blackout, the three-judge District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that  McConnell ’s reasoning that §203 was not facially overbroad left no room for such “as-applied” challenges.  WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period, and the court subsequently dismissed the complaint.  This Court vacated that judgment, holding that  McConnell  “did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges” to §203.   Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.  v.  Federal Election Comm’n  ( WRTL I ),  546 U. S. 410 , 412.  On remand, the District Court granted WRTL summary judgment, holding §203 unconstitutional as applied to the three ads.  The court first found that adjudication was not barred by mootness because the controversy was capable of repetition, yet evading review.  On the merits, it concluded that the ads were genuine issue ads,  not  express advocacy or its “functional equivalent” under  McConnell,  and held that no compelling interest justified BCRA’s regulation of such ads.   
 Held:  The judgment is affirmed. 
 466 F. Supp. 2d 195, affirmed. 
    The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the Court has jurisdiction to decide these cases.  The FEC argues that the cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL neither asserts a continuing interest in running its ads nor identifies any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.  These cases, however, fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.  That exception applies where “(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again,”  Spencer  v.  Kemna ,  523 U. S. 1 , 17.  Both circumstances are present here.  First, it would be unreasonable to expect that WRTL could have obtained complete judicial review of its claims in time to air its ads during the BCRA blackout periods.  Indeed,  two  BCRA blackout periods have passed during the pendency of this action.  Second, there exists a reasonable expectation that the same “controversy” involving the same party will recur: WRTL has credibly claimed that it plans to run materially similar targeted ads during future blackout periods, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will refrain from prosecuting future BCRA violations.  Pp. 7–10. 
 

   The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Alito, concluded that BCRA §203 is unconstitutional as applied to the ads at issue in these cases.  Pp. 10–29.   
 

   1. The speech at issue is not the “functional equivalent” of express campaign speech.  Pp.  10–22. 
 

      (a) Appellants are wrong in arguing that WRTL has the burden of demonstrating that §203 is unconstitutional.  Because §203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny, see,  e.g., McConnell ,  supra,  at 205, under which the  Government  must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL’s ads furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, see  First Nat. Bank of Boston  v.  Bellotti ,  435 U. S. 765 , 786.  Given that  McConnell ,  supra,  at 206, already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent, the FEC’s burden is not onerous insofar as these ads fit this description.  Pp. 10–11.  
 

      (b) Contrary to the FEC’s contention,  McConnell,  540 U. S., at 205–206, did not establish an intent-and-effect test for determining if a particular ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Indeed,  McConnell  did not adopt any test for future as-applied challenges, but simply grounded its analysis in the evidentiary record, which included two key studies that separated ads based on whether they were intended to, or had the effect of, supporting candidates for federal office.   Id.,  at 308–309.  More importantly,  Buckley  v.  Valeo ,  424 U. S. 1 , 14, 43–44, rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates, and  McConnell  did not purport to overrule  Buckley  on this point—or even address what  Buckley  had to say on the subject.  Pp. 11–15.  
 

      (c) Because WRTL’s ads may reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate, they are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy, and therefore fall outside  McConnell ’s scope.  To safeguard freedom of speech on public issues, the proper standard for an as-applied challenge to BCRA §203 must be objective, focusing on the communication’s substance rather than on amorphous considerations of intent and effect.  See  Buckley, supra ,   at 43–44.    It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow parties to resolve disputes quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation.  See  Virginia  v.  Hicks ,  539 U. S. 113 , 119.  And it must eschew “the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,” which “invit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.”   Jerome B. Grubart, Inc.  v.  Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. ,  513 U. S. 527 , 547.  In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.  See  New York Times Co.  v.  Sullivan ,  376 U. S. 254 , 269–270.  In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  WRTL’s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy under this test.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: They focus and take a position on a legislative issue and exhort the public to adopt that position and to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: They do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they take no position on a candidate’s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.  Pp. 15–22.  
 

   2. Because WRTL’s ads are not express advocacy or its functional equivalent, and because appellants identify no interest sufficiently compelling to justify burdening WRTL’s speech, BCRA §203 is unconstitutional as applied to the ads.  The section can be constitutionally applied only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest.   E.g., McConnell, supra , at 205.  None of the interests that might justify regulating WRTL’s ads are sufficiently compelling.  Although the Court has long recognized “the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption” in election campaigns,  Buckley , 424 U. S., at 45, it has invoked this interest as a reason for upholding  contribution  limits,  id.,  at 26–27, and suggested that it might also justify limits on electioneering  expenditures  posing the same dangers as large contributions,  id.,  at 45.   McConnell  arguably applied this interest to ads that were the “functional equivalent” of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204–206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL’s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are  not  the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Issue ads like WRTL’s are not equivalent to contributions, and the corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  A second possible compelling interest lies in addressing “the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.”   Austin  v.  Michigan Chamber of Commerce ,  494 U. S. 652 , 660.   McConnell  held that this interest justifies regulating the “functional equivalent” of campaign speech, 540 U. S., at 205–206.  This interest cannot be extended further to apply to genuine issue ads like WRTL’s, see,  e.g., id.,  at 206, n. 88, because doing so would call into question this Court’s holdings that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.   WRTL I  reinforced the validity of this point by holding §203 susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411–412.  Pp. 23–28. 
 

   3. These cases present no occasion to revisit  McConnell ’s holding that a corporation’s express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a ban—the question here—the Court should give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.  Pp. 28–29. 
 

   Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas, agreed that the Court has jurisdiction in these cases and concurred in the Court’s judgment because he would overrule that part of  McConnell  v.  Federal Election Comm’n ,  540 U. S. 93 , upholding §203(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA).  Pp. 4–23. 
 

   1. The pertinent case law begins with  Buckley  v.  Valeo ,  424 U. S. 1 , in which the Court held,  inter alia,  that a federal limitation on campaign expenditures not made in coordination with a candidate’s campaign (contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA)) was unconstitutional,  id. , at 39–51.  In light of vagueness concerns, the Court narrowly construed the independent-expenditure provision to cover only express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office by use of such magic words “as ‘vote for,’ ‘elect,’ … ‘vote against,’ ‘defeat,’ ‘reject.’ ”   Id. , at 44, and n. 52.  This narrowing construction excluded so-called “issue advocacy” referring to a clearly identified candidate’s position on an issue, but not expressly advocating his election or defeat.  Even as narrowly construed, however, the Court struck the provision down.   Id. , at 45–46.  Despite  Buckley,  some argued that independent expenditures  by corporations  should be treated differently.  A post- Buckley  case,  First Nat. Bank of Boston  v.  Bellotti ,  435 U. S. 765 , 776–777, struck down, on First Amendment grounds, a state statute prohibiting corporations from spending money in connection with a referendum.  The Court strayed far from these principles, however, in  Austin  v.  Michigan Chamber of Commerce ,  494 U. S. 652 , upholding state restrictions on corporations’ independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, candidates for state office,  id. , at 654–655.   Austin  was wrongly decided, but at least it was limited to express advocacy.   Nonexpress  advocacy was presumed to remain protected under  Buckley  and  Bellotti,  even when engaged in by corporations, until  McConnell .   McConnell  held,  inter alia,  that the compelling governmental interest supporting restrictions on corporate expenditures for express advocacy— i.e.,   Austin ’s perceived “corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth,” 540 U. S., at 205—also justified extending those restrictions to ads run during the BCRA blackout period “to the extent … [they] are  the functional equivalent of express advocacy, ”  id. , at 206 (emphasis added).   McConnell  upheld BCRA §203(a) against a facial challenge.  Subsequently, in  Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.  v.  Federal Election Comm’n ,  546 U. S. 410 , 411–412, the Court held that  McConnell  did not foreclose as-applied challenges to §203.  Pp. 4–10.  
 

   2.  McConnell ’s holding concerning §203 was wrong.  The answer to whether WRTL meets the standard for prevailing in an as-applied challenge requires the Court to articulate the standard.  The most obvious standard is  McConnell ’s, which asks whether an ad is the “functional equivalent of express advocacy,” 540 U. S., at 206.  The fundamental and inescapable problem with this test, with the principal opinion’s susceptible-of-no-other-reasonable-interpretation standard, and with other similar tests is that each is impermissibly vague and thus ineffective to vindicate the fundamental First Amendment rights at issue.   Buckley  itself compelled the conclusion that such tests fall short when it narrowed the statutory language there at issue to cover only advertising that used the magic words of express advocacy.  424 U. S., at 43–44.  The only plausible explanation for  Buckley ’s “highly strained” reading of FECA,  McConnell ,  supra , at 280, is that the Court there eschewed narrowing constructions that would have been more faithful to FECA’s text and more effective at capturing campaign speech  because those tests were all too vague .  If  Buckley  foreclosed such vagueness in a statutory test, it also must foreclose such vagueness in an as-applied test.  Yet any clear rule that would protect all genuine issue ads would cover such a substantial number of ads prohibited by §203 that §203 would be rendered substantially overbroad.  Thus,  McConnell  (which presupposed the availability of as-applied challenges)   was mistaken.  Pp. 10–18.  
 

   3.  Stare decisis  would not prevent the Court from overruling  McConnell ’s §203 holding.  This Court’s “considered practice” is not to apply that principle  “ as rigidly in constitutional as in nonconstitutional cases,”  Glidden Co.  v.  Zdanok ,  370 U. S. 530 , 543, and it has not hesitated to overrule a decision offensive to the First Amendment that was decided just a few years earlier, see  West Virginia Bd. of Ed.  v.  Barnette ,  319 U. S. 624 , 642.  Pp. 19–22.

 UNITED STATES  v . WILLIAMS 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
 No. 06–694. Argued October 30, 2007—Decided May 19, 2008 
 After this Court found facially overbroad   a federal statutory provision criminalizing the possession and distribution of material pandered as child pornography, regardless of whether it actually was that,  Ashcroft  v.  Free Speech Coalition ,  535 U. S. 234 , Congress passed the pandering and solicitation provision at issue, 18 U. S. C. §2252A(a)(3)(B).  Respondent Williams pleaded guilty to this offense and others, but reserved the right to challenge his pandering conviction’s constitutionality.  The District Court rejected his challenge, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, finding the statute both overbroad under the First Amendment and impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause. 
 Held:  
    1. Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) is not overbroad under the First Amendment.  Pp. 6–18. 
 

      (a) A statute is facially invalid if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech.  Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) generally prohibits offers to provide and requests to obtain child pornography.  It targets not the underlying material, but the collateral speech introducing such material into the child-pornography distribution network.  Its definition of material or purported material that may not be pandered or solicited precisely tracks the material held constitutionally proscribable in New York"

 DAVIS  v . FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION 
 appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia 
 No. 07–320. Argued April 22, 2008—Decided June 26, 2008 
 Federal-law limits on the amount of contributions a House of Representatives candidate and his authorized committee may receive from an individual, and the amount his party may devote to coordinated campaign expenditures, 2 U. S. C. §§441a(a)(1)(A), (a)(3)(A), (c), and (d), normally apply equally to all competitors for a seat and their authorized committees.  However, §319(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 2 U. S. C. §441a–1(a), part of the so-called “Millionaire’s Amendment,” fundamentally alters this scheme when, as a result of a candidate’s expenditure of personal funds, the “opposition personal funds amount” (OPFA) exceeds $350,000.  The OPFA is a statistic comparing competing candidates’ personal expenditures and taking account of certain other fundraising.  When a “self-financing” candidate’s personal expenditure causes the OPFA to pass $350,000, a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play.  The self-financing candidate remains subject to the normal limitations, but his opponent, the “non-self-financing” candidate, may receive individual contributions at treble the normal limit from individuals who have reached the normal limit on aggregate contributions, and may accept coordinated party expenditures without limit.  See §§441a–1(a)(1)(A)–(C).  Because calculating the OPFA requires certain information about the self-financing candidate’s campaign assets and personal expenditures, §319(b) requires him to file an initial “declaration of intent” revealing the amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000, and to make additional disclosures to the other candidates, their national parties, and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as his personal expenditures exceed certain benchmarks. 
 

      Appellant Davis, a candidate for a House seat in 2004 and 2006 who lost both times to the incumbent, notified the FEC for the 2006 election, in compliance with §319(b), that he intended to spend $1 million in personal funds.  After the FEC informed him it had reason to believe he had violated §319 by failing to report personal expenditures during the 2004 campaign, he filed this suit for a declaration that §319 is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the FEC from enforcing the section during the 2006 election.  The District Court concluded  sU. S.onte  that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on the merits and granted the FEC summary judgment.   
 Held:  
    1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear Davis’ appeal.  Pp. 6–10. 
 

      (a) Davis has standing to challenge §319(b)’s disclosure requirements.  When he filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced by §319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more than $350,000 in personal funds.  He also faced the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure with further notifications once he passed the $350,000 mark.  Securing a declaration that §319(b) is unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement would have spared him from making those disclosures and also would have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged §319(b) violations during his 2004 campaign.  Davis also has standing to challenge §319(a)’s asymmetrical contribution limits.  The standing inquiry focuses on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed, see, e.g.,"

 YSURSA, SECRETARY OF STATE OF IDAHO, et al.  v . POCATELLO EDUCATION ASSOCIATION et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 07–869. Argued November 3, 2008—Decided February 24, 2009 
 Idaho’s Right to Work Act permits public employees to authorize payroll deductions for general union dues, but prohibits such deductions for union political activities.  Respondents—a group of Idaho public employee unions—sued, alleging that the ban on payroll deductions for political activities violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court upheld the ban at the state level, but struck it down as it applies to local governments.  In affirming, the Ninth Circuit stated that, while Idaho has the ultimate control over local governmental units, it did not actually operate or control their payroll deduction systems.  The court applied strict scrutiny to hold that the statute was unconstitutional as applied at the local level.   
 Held:  Idaho’s ban on political payroll deductions, as applied to local governmental units, does not infringe the unions’ First Amendment rights.  Pp. 5–11. 
    (a) Content-based restrictions on speech are “presumptively invalid” and subject to strict scrutiny.   Davenport  v.  Washington Ed. Assn. ,  551 U. S. 177 , ___.  The First Amendment does not, however, impose an obligation on government to subsidize speech.  See  Regan  v.  Taxation With Representation of Wash. ,  461 U. S. 540 , 549.  Idaho’s law does not restrict political speech, but rather declines to promote that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities.  Idaho’s public employee unions are free to engage in such speech as they see fit.  They simply are barred from enlisting the State in support of that endeavor.  Idaho’s decision to limit public employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions’ First Amendment rights.  The State accordingly need only demonstrate a rational basis to justify the ban.  Idaho’s justification is the interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government favoritism or entanglement with partisan politics.  See,  e.g. ,  Civil Service Comm’n  v.  Letter Carriers ,  413 U. S. 548 , 565.   And the State’s response to the problem is limited to its source—political payroll deductions.  Cf.  Davenport ,  supra .  The ban plainly serves the State’s interest in separating public employment from political activities.  Pp. 5–8. 
 

   (b) The ban at issue is valid at the local level.  The same deferential review applies whether the ban is directed at state or local governmental entities.  Political subdivisions have never been considered sovereign entities but are instead “subordinate governmental instrumentalities.”   Reynolds  v.  Sims ,  377 U. S. 533 , 575.  The State’s legislative action is subject to First Amendment scrutiny whether it is applicable at the state level, the local level, both, or some subpart of either, but no case suggests that a different analysis applies depending on the level of government affected.  The ban furthers Idaho’s interest in separating the operation of government from partisan politics, and that interest extends to all public employers at whatever level of government.  Pp. 9–11.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 PLEASANT GROVE CITY, UTAH, et al.  v . SUMMUM 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
 No. 07–665. Argued November 12, 2008—Decided February 25, 2009 
 Pioneer Park (Park), a public park in petitioner Pleasant Grove City (City), has at least 11 permanent, privately donated displays, including a Ten Commandments monument.  In rejecting the request of respondent Summum, a religious organization, to erect a monument containing the Seven Aphorisms of Summum, the City explained that it limited Park monuments to those either directly related to the City’s history or donated by groups with longstanding community ties.  After the City put that policy and other criteria into writing, respondent renewed its request, but did not describe the monument’s historical significance or respondent’s connection to the community.  The City rejected the request, and respondent filed suit, claiming that the City and petitioner officials had violated the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause by accepting the Ten Commandments monument but rejecting respondent’s proposed monument.  The District Court denied respondent’s preliminary injunction request, but the Tenth Circuit reversed.  Noting that it had previously found the Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than government speech and that public parks have traditionally been regarded as public forums, the court held that, because the exclusion of the monument was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny, the City was required to erect it immediately. 
 Held:  The placement of a permanent monument in a public park is a form of government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.  Pp. 4–18. 
    (a) Because that Clause restricts government regulation of private speech but not government speech, whether petitioners were engaging in their own expressive conduct or providing a forum for private speech determines which precedents govern here.  Pp. 4–7. 
 

      (1) A government entity “is entitled to say what it wishes,”  Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,  515 U. S. 819 , 833, and to select the views that it wants to express, see,  e.g., Rust  v.  Sullivan ,  500 U. S. 173 , 194.  It may exercise this same freedom when it receives private assistance for the purpose of delivering a government-controlled message.  See  Johanns  v.  Livestock Marketing Assn. ,  544 U. S. 550 , 562.  This does not mean that there are no restraints on government speech.  For example, government speech must comport with the Establishment Clause.  In addition, public officials’ involvement in advocacy may be limited by law, regulation, or practice; and a government entity is ultimately “accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy,”  Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System  v.  Southworth ,  529 U. S. 217 , 235.  Pp. 4–6. 
 

      (2) In contrast, government entities are strictly limited in their ability to regulate private speech in “traditional public fora.”   Cornelius  v.  NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc. ,  473 U. S. 788 , 800.  Reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions are allowed, see  Perry Ed. Assn.  v.  Perry Local Educators’ Assn. ,  460 U. S. 37 , 45, but content-based restrictions must satisfy strict scrutiny,  i.e.,  they must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, see  Cornelius ,  supra , at 800.  Restrictions based on viewpoint are also prohibited.   Carey  v.  Brown ,  447 U. S. 455 , 463.  Government restrictions on speech in a “designated public forum” are subject to the same strict scrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum.   Cornelius ,  supra,  at 800.  And where government creates a forum that is limited to use by certain groups or dedicated to the discussion of certain subjects,  Perry Ed. Assn. ,  supra , at 46, n. 7, it may impose reasonable and viewpoint-neutral restrictions, see  Good News Club  v.  Milford Central School ,  533 U. S. 98 , 106–107.  Pp. 6–7. 
 

   (b) Permanent monuments displayed on public property typically represent government speech.  Governments have long used monuments to speak to the public.  Thus, a government-commissioned and government-financed monument placed on public land constitutes government speech.  So, too, are privately financed and donated monuments that the government accepts for public display on government land.  While government entities regularly accept privately funded or donated monuments, their general practice has been one of selective receptivity.  Because city parks play an important role in defining the identity that a city projects to its residents and the outside world, cities take care in accepting donated monuments, selecting those that portray what the government decisionmakers view as appropriate for the place in question, based on esthetics, history, and local culture.  The accepted monuments are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message and thus constitute government speech.  Pp. 7–10. 
 

   (c) Here, the Park’s monuments clearly represent government speech.  Although many were donated in completed form by private entities, the City has “effectively controlled” their messages by exercising “final approval authority” over their selection.   Johanns ,  supra,  at 560–561.  The City has selected monuments that present the image that the City wishes to project to Park visitors; it has taken ownership of most of the monuments in the Park, including the Ten Commandments monument; and it has now expressly set out selection criteria.  P. 10. 
 

   (d) Respondent’s legitimate concern that the government speech doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for favoring certain viewpoints does not mean that a government entity should be required to embrace publicly a privately donated monument’s “message” in order to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions.  A city engages in expressive conduct by accepting and displaying a privately donated monument, but it does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any particular donor sees in the monument.  A government’s message may be altered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in the same vicinity.  It may also change over time.  Pp. 10–15. 
 

   (e) “[P]ublic forum principles … are out of place in the context of this case.”   United States  v.  American Library Assn., Inc. ,  539 U. S. 194 , 205.  The forum doctrine applies where a government property or program is capable of accommodating a large number of public speakers without defeating the essential function of the land or program, but public parks can accommodate only a limited number of permanent monuments.  If governments must maintain viewpoint neutrality in selecting donated monuments, they must either prepare for cluttered parks or face pressure to remove longstanding and cherished monuments.  Were public parks considered traditional public forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments, most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations.  And if forum analysis would lead almost inexorably to closing of the forum, forum analysis is out of place.   Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.  v.  Pinette ,  515 U. S. 753 , distinguished.  Pp. 15–18.

COMMISSION 
 appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia 
 No. 08–205. Argued March 24, 2009—Reargued September 9, 2009––Decided January 21, 2010 
 As amended by §203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech that is an “electioneering communication” or for speech that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate.  2 U. S. C. §441b.  An electioneering communication is “any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office” and is made within 30 days of a primary election, §434(f)(3)(A), and that is “publicly distributed,” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2), which in “the case of a candidate for nomination for President … means” that the communication “[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election … is being held within 30 days,” §100.29(b)(3)(ii).  Corporations and unions may establish a political action committee (PAC) for express advocacy or electioneering communications purposes.  2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(2).  In  McConnell  v.  Federal Election Comm’n ,  540 U. S. 93 , 203–209, this Court upheld limits on electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying on the holding in  Austin  v.  Michigan Chamber of Commerce ,  494 U. S. 652 , that political speech may be banned based on the speaker’s corporate identity. 
 

      In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, released a documentary (hereinafter  Hillary ) critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party’s Presidential nomination.  Anticipating that it would make  Hillary  available on cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections, Citizens United produced television ads to run on broadcast and cable television.  Concerned about possible civil and criminal penalties for violating §441b, it sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that (1) §441b is unconstitutional as applied to  Hillary;  and (2) BCRA’s disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements, BCRA §§201 and 311, were unconstitutional as applied to  Hillary  and the ads.  The District Court denied Citizens United a preliminary injunction and granted appellee Federal Election Commission (FEC) summary judgment.

 MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A., et al.  v . UNITED STATES 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
 No. 08–1119. Argued December 1, 2009—Decided March 8, 2010 
 The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) amended the Bankruptcy Code to define a class of bankruptcy professionals termed “debt relief agenc[ies].”  11 U. S. C. §101(12A).  That class includes, with limited exceptions, “any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person … for … payment … , or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.”   Ibid.   The BAPCPA prohibits such professionals from “advis[ing] an assisted person … to incur more debt in contemplation of [filing for bankruptcy] … .”  §526(a)(4).  It also requires them to disclose in their advertisements for certain services that the services are with respect to or may involve bankruptcy relief, §§528(a)(3), (b)(2)(A), and to identify themselves as debt relief agencies, §§528(a)(4), (b)(2)(B).   
 

      The plaintiffs in this litigation—a law firm and others (collectively Milavetz)—filed a preenforcement suit seeking declaratory relief, arguing that Milavetz is not bound by the BAPCPA’s debt-relief-agency provisions and therefore can freely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not make the requisite disclosures in its advertisements.  The District Court found that “debt relief agency” does not include attorneys and that §§526 and 528 are unconstitutional as applied to that class of professionals.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, rejecting the District Court’s conclusion that attorneys are not “debt relief agenc[ies]”; upholding application of §528’s disclosure requirements to attorneys; and finding §526(a)(4) unconstitutional because it broadly prohibits debt relief agencies from advising assisted persons to incur  any  additional debt in contemplation of bankruptcy even when the advice constitutes prudent prebankruptcy planning. 
 Held: 
    1. Attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA.  By definition, “bankruptcy assistance” includes several services commonly performed by attorneys, e.g., "

SALAZAR V. BUONO 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, et al.  v . BUONO 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 08–472. Argued October 7, 2009—Decided April 28, 2010 
 In 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) placed a Latin cross on federal land in the Mojave National Preserve (Preserve) to honor American soldiers who died in World War I.  Claiming to be offended by a religious symbol’s presence on federal land, respondent Buono, a regular visitor to the Preserve, filed this suit alleging a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause and seeking an injunction requiring the Government to remove the cross.  In the litigation’s first stage  (Buono I) , the District Court found that Buono had standing to sue and, concluding that the presence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion, see  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman ,  403 U. S. 602 , 612–613, it granted Buono’s requested injunctive relief (2002 injunction).  The District Court did not consider whether the Government’s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or caused entanglement with religion.  While the Government’s appeal was pending, Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, §8121(a) of which directed the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in exchange for privately owned land elsewhere in the Preserve (land-transfer statute).  Affirming the District Court’s judgment both as to standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined to address the statute’s effect on Buono’s suit or the statute’s constitutionality  (Buono II).   Because the Government did not seek review by this Court, the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final.  Buono then returned to the District Court seeking injunctive relief against the land transfer, either through enforcement or modification of the 2002 injunction.  In 2005, that court rejected the Government’s claim that the transfer was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction, concluding, instead, that it was actually an invalid attempt to keep the cross on display.  The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the 2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it; and permanently enjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute  (Buono III).   The Ninth Circuit again affirmed, largely following the District Court’s reasoning .   
 Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 
 502 F. 3d 1069 and 527 F. 3d 758, reversed and remanded. 
    Justice Kennedy, joined in full by The Chief Justice and in part by Justice Alito, concluded: 
 

   1. Buono has standing to maintain this action.  Whatever the validity of the Government’s argument that Buono’s asserted injury—offense at a religious symbol’s presence on federal land—is not personal to him and so does not confer Article III standing, that argument is not available at this stage of the litigation.  The District Court rejected the argument in  Buono I,  the Ninth Circuit affirmed in  Buono II,  and the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final and unreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline for filing a certiorari petition, 28 U. S. C. §2101(c).  Moreover, Buono had standing in  Buono III  to seek application of the injunction against the land-transfer statute.  A party that obtains a judgment in its favor acquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring compliance with that judgment.  See  Allen  v.  Wright ,  468 U. S. 737 .  Buono’s entitlement to an injunction having been established in  Buono I  and  II , he sought in  Buono III  to prevent the Government from frustrating or evading that injunction.  His interests in doing so were sufficiently personal and concrete to support his standing, given the rights he obtained under the earlier decree against the same party as to the same cross and the same land.  The Government’s contention that Buono sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the 2002 injunction is not an argument about standing, but about the merits of the District Court’s order.  Pp. 7–9. 
 

   2. The District Court erred in enjoining the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute on the premise that the relief was necessary to protect Buono’s rights under the 2002 injunction.  Pp. 9–18. 
 

      (a) A court may order an injunction only after taking into account all the circumstances bearing on the need for prospective relief.  See,  e.g., United States  v.  Swift & Co. ,  286 U. S. 106 , 114.  Here, the District Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry.  The land-transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the requested relief.  By dismissing as illicit the motives of Congress in passing it, the District Court took insufficient account of the context in which the statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage.  Placement of the cross on federal land by private persons was not an attempt to set the state’s  imprimatur  on a particular creed.  Rather, the intent was simply to honor fallen soldiers.  Moreover, the cross stood for nearly seven decades before the statute was enacted, by which time the cross and the cause it commemorated had become entwined in the public consciousness.  The 2002 injunction thus presented the Government with a dilemma.  It could not maintain the cross without violating the injunction, but it could not remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as honoring.  Deeming neither alternative satisfactory, Congress enacted the land-transfer statute.  The statute embodied a legislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a framework and policy of accommodation.  The statute should not have been dismissed as an evasion, for it brought about a change of law and a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.  Pp. 9–13. 
 

      (b) Where legislative action undermines the basis for previous relief, the relevant question is whether an ongoing exercise of the court’s equitable authority is supported by the prior showing of illegality, judged against the claim that changed circumstances render prospective relief inappropriate.  The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based solely on its conclusion that the presence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds.  Neither court considered whether the Government had acted based on an improper purpose.  Given this sole reliance on perception, any further relief grounded on the injunction should have rested on the same basis.  But the District Court used an injunction granted for one reason (perceived governmental endorsement) as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged to be objectionable for a different reason (an illicit governmental purpose).  Ordering relief under such circumstances was improper.  The court failed to consider whether the change in law and circumstances effected by the land-transfer statute had rendered the “reasonable observer” standard inappropriate to resolve the dispute.  Nor did the court attempt to reassess  Buono I ’s findings in light of the accommodation policy embraced by Congress.  Rather, it concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross, divorced from its background and context.  Pp. 13–17. 
 

      (c) The same respect for a coordinate branch of Government that forbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality, see,  e.g., United States  v.  Morrison ,  529 U. S. 598 , 607, requires that a congressional command be given effect unless no legal alternative exists.  Even if, contrary to the congressional judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient accommodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was incumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than complete invalidation of the statute.  See,  e.g., Ayotte  v.  Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng. ,  546 U. S. 320 , 329.  On remand, that court should conduct a proper inquiry into the continued necessity for injunctive relief in light of the statute.  Pp. 17–18.  
 

   Justice Alito concluded that this case should not be remanded for the lower courts to decide whether implementation of the land-transfer statute would violate the District Court’s injunction or the Establishment Clause.  Rather, because the factual record has been sufficiently developed to permit resolution of these questions, he would decide them and hold that the statute may be implemented.  The case’s singular circumstances presented Congress with a delicate problem.  Its solution was an approach designed to eliminate any perception of religious sponsorship stemming from the location of the cross on federally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbolism that some would associate with the destruction of this historic monument.  The mechanism Congress selected is quite common in the West, a “land exchange,” whereby ownership of the land on which the cross is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for another nearby parcel of equal value.  The land transfer would not violate the District Court injunction, the obvious meaning of which was simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain on  federal  land.  Nor would the statute’s implementation constitute an endorsement of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.  The so-called “endorsement test” views a challenged religious display through the eyes of a hypothetical reasonable observer aware of the history and all other pertinent facts relating to the display.  Here, therefore, this observer would be familiar with the monument’s origin and history and thereby appreciate that the transfer represents an effort by Congress to address a unique situation and to find a solution that best accommodates conflicting concerns.  Finally, the statute was not enacted for the illicit purpose of embracing the monument’s religious message but to commemorate the Nation’s war dead and to avoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been created by the monument’s destruction.  Pp. 1–7. 
 

   Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded that this Court need not—indeed,  cannot —decide this case’s merits because Buono lacks Article III standing to pursue the relief he seeks, which is not enforcement of the original injunction but expansion of it.  By enjoining the Government from implementing the statute at issue, the District Court’s 2005 order went well beyond the original injunction’s proscription of the cross’s display on public property.  Because Buono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue that relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will “redress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to [him] caused by private or official violation of law.”   Summers  v.  Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. ___, ___.  He has failed, however, to allege any such injury.  Even assuming that being offended by a religious display constitutes a cognizable injury, it is merely speculative whether the cross will remain in place, and in any event Buono has made clear, by admitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on private property, that  he  will not be offended.  Neither district courts’ discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this District Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as merely enforcing the existing injunction makes any difference.  If in fact a court awards new relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to do so.  Pp. 1–7.

UNITED STATES V. STEVENS 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 UNITED STATES  v . STEVENS 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
 No. 08–769. Argued October 6, 2009—Decided April 20, 2010 
 Congress enacted 18 U. S. C. §48 to criminalize the commercial creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty.  The statute addresses only  portrayals  of harmful acts, not the underlying conduct.  It applies to any visual or auditory depiction “in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed,” if that conduct violates federal or state law where “the creation, sale, or possession takes place,” §48(c)(1).  Another clause exempts depictions with “serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.”  §48(b).  The legislative background of §48 focused primarily on “crush videos,” which feature the torture and killing of helpless animals and are said to appeal to persons with a specific sexual fetish.  Respondent Stevens was indicted under §48 for selling videos depicting dogfighting.  He moved to dismiss, arguing that §48 is facially invalid under the First Amendment.  The District Court denied his motion, and Stevens was convicted.  The Third Circuit vacated the conviction and declared §48 facially unconstitutional as a content-based regulation of protected speech. 
 Held:  Section §48 is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.  Pp. 5–20. 
    (a) Depictions of animal cruelty are not, as a class, categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.  Because §48 explicitly regulates expression based on content, it is “ ‘presumptively invalid,’ … and the Government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.”   United States  v.  Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. ,  529 U. S. 803 , 817.  Since its enactment, the First Amendment has permitted restrictions on a few historic categories of speech—including obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement, and speech integral to criminal conduct—that “have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,”  Chaplinsky  v.  New Hampshire ,  315 U. S. 568 , 572.  Depictions of animal cruelty should not be added to that list.  While the prohibition of animal cruelty has a long history in American law, there is no evidence of a similar tradition prohibiting  depictions  of such cruelty.  The Government’s proposed test would broadly balance the value of the speech against its societal costs to determine whether the First Amendment even applies.  But the First Amendment’s free speech guarantee does not extend only to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.  The Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.   New York  v.  Ferber ,  458 U. S. 747 , distinguished.  Pp. 5–9. 
 

   (b) Stevens’s facial challenge succeeds under existing doctrine.  Pp. 9–20. 
 

      (1) In the First Amendment context, a law may be invalidated as overbroad if “a ‘substantial number’ of its applications are unconstitutional, ‘ “judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” ’ ”  Washington State Grange  v.  Washington State Republican Party ,  552 U. S. 442 , 449, n. 6.  Stevens claims that common depictions of ordinary and lawful activities constitute the vast majority of materials subject to §48.  The Government does not defend such applications, but contends that the statute is narrowly limited to specific types of extreme material.  Section 48’s constitutionality thus turns on how broadly it is construed.  Pp. 9–10. 
 

      (2) Section 48 creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.  The statute’s definition of a “depiction of animal cruelty” does not even require that the depicted conduct be cruel.  While the words “maimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey cruelty, “wounded” and “killed” do not.  Those words have little ambiguity and should be read according to their ordinary meaning.  Section 48 does require that the depicted conduct be “illegal,” but many federal and state laws concerning the proper treatment of animals are not designed to guard against animal cruelty.  For example, endangered species protections restrict even the humane wounding or killing of animals.  The statute draws no distinction based on the reason the conduct is made illegal. 
 

      Moreover, §48 applies to any depiction of conduct that is illegal in the State in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed, “regardless of whether the … wounding … or killing took place” there, §48(c)(1).  Depictions of entirely lawful conduct may run afoul of the ban if those depictions later find their way into States where the same conduct is unlawful.  This greatly expands §48’s scope, because views about animal cruelty and regulations having no connection to cruelty vary widely from place to place.  Hunting is unlawful in the District of Columbia, for example, but there is an enormous national market for hunting-related depictions, greatly exceeding the demand for crush videos or animal fighting depictions.  Because the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country, §48(a) applies to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting that is sold in the Nation’s Capital.  Those seeking to comply with the law face a bewildering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate jurisdictions.  Pp. 11–15. 
 

      (3) Limiting §48’s reach to crush videos and depictions of animal fighting or other extreme cruelty, as the Government suggests, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the statute’s exceptions clause.  The statute only exempts material with “serious” value, and “serious” must be taken seriously.  The excepted speech must also fall within one of §48(b)’s enumerated categories.  Much speech does not.  For example, most hunting depictions are not obviously instructional in nature.  The exceptions clause simply has no adequate reading that results in the statute’s banning only the depictions the Government would like to ban. 
 

      Although the language of §48(b) is drawn from the Court’s decision in  Miller  v.  California ,  413 U. S. 15 , the exceptions clause does not answer every First Amendment objection.  Under  Miller , “serious” value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity.  But  Miller  did not determine that serious value could be used as a general precondition to protecting  other  types of speech in the first place.  Even “ ‘wholly neutral futilities … come under the protection of free speech.’ ”   Cohen  v.  California ,  403 U. S. 15 , 25.  The First Amendment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not qualify for §48(b)’s serious-value exception, but nonetheless fall within §48(c)’s broad reach.  Pp. 15–17. 
 

      (4) Despite the Government’s assurance that it will apply §48 to reach only “extreme” cruelty, this Court will not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promises to use it responsibly.  Nor can the Court construe this statutory language to avoid constitutional doubt.  A limiting construction can be imposed only if the statute “is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a construction,”  Reno  v.  American Civil Liberties Union ,  521 U. S. 844 , 884.  To read §48 as the Government desires requires rewriting, not just reinterpretation.  Pp. 18–19.   
 

      (5) This construction of §48 decides the constitutional question.  The Government makes no effort to defend §48 as applied beyond crush videos and depictions of animal fighting.  It argues that those particular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or are analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the ban on such speech would satisfy the proper level of scrutiny.  But the Government nowhere extends these arguments to other depictions, such as hunting magazines and videos, that are presumptively protected by the First Amendment but that remain subject to §48.  Nor does the Government seriously contest that these presumptively impermissible applications of §48 far outnumber any permissible ones.  The Court therefore does not decide whether a statute limited to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would be constitutional.  Section 48 is not so limited but is instead substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.  Pp. 19–20.   
 533 F. 3d 218, affirmed. 
    Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

HOLDER V. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT  
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.  v . HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 08–1498. Argued February 23, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010 
 It is a federal crime to “knowingly provid[e] material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.”  18 U. S. C. §2339B(a)(1).  The authority to designate an entity a “foreign terrorist organization” rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.  “[T]he term ‘material support or resources’ means any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.”  §2339A(b)(1).  Over the years, §2339B and the definition of “material support or resources” have been amended,  inter alia,  to clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign group’s designation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts, §2339B(a)(1); and to define the terms “training,” §2339A(b)(2), “expert advice or assistance,” §2339A(b)(3), and “personnel,” §2339B(h). 
 

      Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated “foreign terrorist organization[s]” are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to establish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and Tamils in Sri Lanka.  Although both groups engage in political and humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens.  Claiming they wish to support those groups’ lawful, nonviolent activities, two U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs) initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support statute.  The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history.  Ultimately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the material-support statute against plaintiffs.  After the Ninth Circuit affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certiorari.  The Court granted both petitions. 
 

      As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge §2339B’s prohibition on providing four types of material support—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “service,” and “personnel”—asserting violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause on the ground that the statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.  They claim that §2339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK members to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.      
 Held:  The material-support statute, §2339B, is constitutional as applied to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terrorist organizations.  Pp. 8–36. 
    (a) This preenforcement challenge to §2339B is a justiciable Article III case or controversy.  Plaintiffs face “a credible threat of prosecution” and “should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.”   Babbitt  v.  Farm Workers ,  442 U. S. 289 , 298.  P. 10.  
 

   (b) The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litigation by accepting plaintiffs’ argument that the material-support statute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organization’s illegal activities.  That reading is inconsistent with §2339B’s text, which prohibits “knowingly” providing material support and demonstrates that Congress chose knowledge about the organization’s connection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activities, as the necessary mental state for a violation.  Plaintiffs’ reading is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding §2339B, which—unlike §2339B—do refer to intent to further terrorist activity.  See §§2339A(a), 2339C(a)(1).  Finally, there is no textual basis for plaintiffs’ argument that the same language in §2339B should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but not with regard to other forms of material support.  Pp. 10–12.  
 

   (c) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plaintiffs’ vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, holding that “training,” “service,” and a portion of “expert advice or assistance” were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected speech—regardless of whether those applications were clear.  The Court of Appeals also contravened the rule that “[a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.”   Hoffman Estates  v.  Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc. ,  455 U. S. 489 , 495. 
 

   The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, “provide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.”   United States  v.  Williams ,  553 U. S. 285 , 304.  The statutory terms at issue here—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “service,” and “personnel”—are quite different from the sorts of terms, like “ ‘annoying’ ” and “ ‘indecent,’ ” that the Court has struck down for requiring “wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.”   Id.,  at 306.  Congress has increased the clarity of §2339B’s terms by adding narrowing definitions, and §2339B’s knowledge requirement further reduces any potential for vagueness, see  Hill  v.  Colorado ,  530 U. S. 703 , 732. 
 

   Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dispositive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plaintiffs’ proposed conduct.  Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage readily fall within the scope of “training” and “expert advice or assistance.”  In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used those terms to describe their own proposed activities.  Plaintiffs’ resort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of “training” and “expert advice or assistance” is beside the point because this litigation does not concern such situations.  See  Scales  v.  United States ,  367 U. S. 203 , 223.   Gentile  v.  State Bar of Nev. ,  501 U. S. 1030 , 1049–1051, distinguished.  Plaintiffs’ further contention, that the statute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish to undertake, runs afoul of §2339B(h), which makes clear that “personnel” does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of “service,” which refers to concerted activity, not independent advocacy.  Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a cause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service “to a foreign terrorist organization.”  §2339B(a)(1). 
 

   Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage is not prohibited by §2339B.  On the other hand, a person of ordinary intelligence would understand the term “service” to cover advocacy performed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.  Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or coordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a “service.”  Because plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the degree to which  they  seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement challenge. See  Washington State Grange  v.  Washington State Republican Party ,  552 U. S. 442 , 454.  Pp. 13–20.  
 

   (d) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Pp. 20–34.   
 

      (1) Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on this question.  Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure political speech.  That claim is unfounded because, under the material-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.  Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or membership in the PKK and LTTE.  Rather, Congress has prohibited “material support,” which most often does not take the form of speech.  And when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.  On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the correct standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in  United States  v.  O’Brien ,  391 U. S. 367 , 377.  That standard is not used to review a content-based regulation of speech, and §2339B regulates plaintiffs’ speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its content.  Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.    Thus, the Court “must [apply] a more demanding standard” than the one described in  O’Brien .   Texas  v.  Johnson ,  491 U. S. 397 , 403.  Pp. 20–23. 
 

      (2) The parties agree that the Government’s interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech, which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK and LTTE.  Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terrorism is an empirical question.  Congress rejected plaintiffs’ position on that question when it enacted §2339B, finding that “foreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that conduct.”  §301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following §2339B.  The record confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs’ view.  The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.  It is not difficult to conclude, as Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great that working in coordination with them or at their command legitimizes and furthers their terrorist means.  Moreover, material support meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to advance terrorism in multiple ways.  The record shows that designated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational firewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or financial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and those used to carry out terrorist attacks.  Providing material support in any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to prevent terrorism and strain the United States’ relationships with its allies, including those that are defending themselves against violent insurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups.  Pp. 23–28.  
 

      (3) The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual inferences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive Branch’s stated view that the experience and analysis of Government agencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Congress’s finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organizations—even those for seemingly benign purposes—further those groups’ terrorist activities.  That evaluation of the facts, like Congress’s assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive national security and foreign relations interests at stake.  The Court does not defer to the Government’s reading of the First Amendment.  But respect for the Government’s factual conclusions is appropriate in light of the courts’ lack of expertise with respect to national security and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terrorist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to obtain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and conclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than concrete evidence.  The Court also finds it significant that Congress has been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions may implicate constitutional concerns.  Most importantly, Congress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups.  Given the sensitive interests in national security and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have adequately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material support in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign terrorist groups serves the Government’s interest in preventing terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to promote only the groups’ nonviolent ends. 
 

   As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is wholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use international law to resolve disputes would provide that group with information and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strategy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.  Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.  Plaintiffs’ proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge.  The Court does not decide whether any future applications of the material-support statute to speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny.  It simply holds that §2339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide.  Pp. 28–34. 
 

      (e) Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs’ First Amendment freedom of association.  Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Court’s precedents.  The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected this claim because §2339B does not penalize mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist groups material support.  Any burden on plaintiffs’ freedom of association caused by preventing them from supporting designated foreign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.  Pp. 34–35.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOCIETY CHAPTER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW, aka HASTINGS CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP  v . MARTINEZ et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 08–1371. Argued April 19, 2010—Decided June 28, 2010 
 Respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings), a school within the University of California public-school system, extends official recognition to student groups through its “Registered Student Organization” (RSO) program.  Several benefits attend this school-approved status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of communication, as well as Hastings’ name and logo.  In exchange for recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions.  Critical here, all RSOs must comply with the school’s Nondiscrimination Policy, which tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, including religion and sexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers: RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs.   
 

      At the beginning of the 2004–2005 academic year, the leaders of an existing Christian RSO formed petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that charters student chapters at law schools throughout the country.  These chapters must adopt bylaws that,  inter alia , require members and officers to sign a “Statement of Faith” and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed principles.  Among those tenets is the belief that sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a woman.  CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in “unrepentant homosexual conduct” or holds religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.  Hastings rejected CLS’s application for RSO status on the ground that the group’s bylaws did not comply with Hastings’ open-access policy because they excluded students based on religion and sexual orientation.  
 

      CLS filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that Hastings’ refusal to grant the group RSO status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for Hastings.  The court held that the all-comers condition on access to a limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore did not violate CLS’s right to free speech.  Nor, in the court’s view, did Hastings impermissibly impair CLS’s right to expressive association: Hastings did not order CLS to admit any student, nor did the school proscribe any speech; Hastings merely placed conditions on the use of school facilities and funds .   The court also rejected CLS’s free exercise argument, stating that the Nondiscrimination Policy did not single out religious beliefs, but rather was neutral and of general applicability.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that the all-comers condition on RSO recognition was reasonable and viewpoint neutral. 
 Held :  
    1. The Court considers only whether a public institution’s conditioning access to a student-organization forum on compliance with an all-comers policy violates the Constitution.  CLS urges the Court to review, instead, the Nondiscrimination Policy as written—prohibiting discrimination on enumerated bases, including religion and sexual orientation.  The policy’s written terms, CLS contends, target solely those groups that organize around religious beliefs or that disapprove of particular sexual behavior, and leave other associations free to limit membership to persons committed to the group’s ideology.  This argument flatly contradicts the joint stipulation of facts the parties submitted at the summary-judgment stage, which specified: “Hastings requires that [RSOs] allow any student to participate, … regardless of [her] status or beliefs.  For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican political beliefs … .”  This Court has long recognized that parties are bound by, and cannot contradict, their stipulations.  See,  e.g.,   Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System  v.  Southworth ,  529 U. S. 217 , 226.  The Court therefore rejects CLS’s attempt to escape from the stipulation and shift its target to Hastings’ policy as written.  Pp. 8–12. 
 

   2. The all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the RSO forum; it therefore does not transgress First Amendment limitations.  Pp. 12–31.  
 

      (a) The Court’s limited public forum decisions supply the appropriate framework for assessing both CLS’s free-speech and expressive-association claims; those decisions recognize that a governmental entity, in regulating property in its charge, may impose restrictions on speech that are reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum and viewpoint neutral,  e.g., Rosenberger  v.  Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. ,  515 U. S. 819 , 829.  CLS urges the Court to apply to its expressive-association claim a different line of cases—decisions in which the Court has rigorously reviewed restrictions on associational freedom in the context of public accommodations,  e.g.,   Roberts  v.  United States Jaycees ,  468 U. S. 609 , 623.  But, because CLS’s expressive-association and free-speech arguments merge— who  speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons, colors  what  concept is conveyed—it makes little sense to treat the claims as discrete.  Instead, three observations lead the Court to analyze CLS’s arguments under limited-public-forum precedents. 
 

   First, the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums, as compared to other environments,   apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in a limited public forum.  Speech and expressive-association rights are closely linked.  See  id.,  at 622.  When these intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a speech restriction to survive constitutional review under the limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of expressive association.  Second, the strict scrutiny the Court has applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forums—the State’s authority to “reserv[e] [them] for certain groups.”   Rosenberger , 515 U. S., at 829.  Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes the benefits of official recognition.  The Court’s expressive-association decisions, in contrast, involved regulations that  compelled  a group to include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out.  See,  e.g.,   Boy Scouts of America  v.  Dale ,  530 U. S. 640 , 648.  Application of the less-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition.  Pp. 12–17. 
 

      (b) In three cases, this Court held that public universities had unconstitutionally singled out student groups for disfavored treatment because of their points of view.  See  Healy  v.  James ,  408 U. S. 169 ;  Widmar  v.  Vincent ,  454 U. S. 263 ; and  Rosenberger.   Most recently and comprehensively, in  Rosenberger , the Court held that a university generally may not withhold benefits from student groups because of their religious outlook.  “Once it has opened a limited [public] forum,” the Court emphasized, “the State must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.”  515 U. S. at 829.  It may “not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum, … nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of … viewpoint.”   Ibid .  Pp. 17–19. 
 

      (c) Hastings’ all-comers policy is reasonable, taking into account the RSO forum’s function and “all the surrounding circumstances.”   Cornelius  v.  NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc. ,  473 U. S. 788 , 809.  Pp. 19–28. 
 

         (1) The Court’s inquiry is shaped by the educational context in which it arises: “First Amendment rights must be analyzed in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.”   Widmar , 454 U. S., at 268, n. 5.  This Court is the final arbiter of whether a public university has exceeded constitutional constraints.  The Court has, however, cautioned courts to resist “substitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational policy for those of … school authorities,” for judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school administrators.   Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty.  v.  Rowley ,  458 U. S. 176 , 206.  Because schools enjoy “a significant measure of authority over the type of officially recognized activities in which their students participate,”  Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66)  v.  Mergens ,  496 U. S. 226 , 240, the Court approaches its task here mindful that Hastings’ decisions about the character of its student-group program are due decent respect.  Pp. 19–21.  
 

         (2) The justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers policy are reasonable in light of the RSO forum’s purposes.  First, the policy ensures that the leadership, educational, and social opportunities afforded by RSOs are available to all students.  RSOs are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees; the policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.  Second, the policy helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSO’s motivation for membership restrictions.  CLS’s proposal that Hastings permit exclusion because of  belief  but forbid discrimination due to  status  would impose on Hastings the daunting task of trying to determine whether a student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb.  Third, Hastings reasonably adheres to the view that its policy, to the extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among students.  Fourth, the policy incorporates state-law discrimination proscriptions, thereby conveying Hastings’ decision to decline to subsidize conduct disapproved by the State.  So long as a public school does not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to advance state-law goals stands on firm footing.  Pp. 21–24.  
 

         (3) Hastings’ policy is all the more creditworthy in light of the “substantial alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student] communication to take place.”   Perry Ed. Assn.  v.  Perry Local Educators’ Assn. ,  460 U. S. 37 , 53.  Hastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and certain bulletin boards to advertise events.  Although CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, the advent of electronic media and social-networking sites lessens the importance of those channels.  Private groups, such as fraternities and sororities, commonly maintain a presence at universities without official school affiliation.  CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety of activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the number of students attending those meetings and events doubled.  “The variety and type of alternative modes of access present here,” in short, “compare favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where [the Court has] upheld restrictions.”   Id.,  at 53–54.  Pp. 24–25.  
 

         (4) CLS’s arguments that the all-comers policy is not reasonable are unavailing.  CLS contends that there can be no diversity of viewpoints in a forum when groups are not permitted to form around viewpoints, but this argument confuses CLS’s preferred policy with constitutional limitation—the  advisability  of Hastings’ policy does not control its  permissibility .  A State’s restriction on access to a limited public forum, moreover, “need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.”   Cornelius , 473 U. S., at 808.  CLS’s contention that Hastings’ policy will facilitate hostile takeovers of RSOs by student saboteurs bent on subverting a group’s mission is more hypothetical than real; there is no history or prospect of RSO-hijackings at Hastings.  Cf.  National Endowment for Arts  v.  Finley ,  524 U. S. 569 , 584.  Finally, CLS’s assertion that Hastings lacks any legitimate interest in urging religious groups not to favor co-religionists erroneously focuses on the benefits the group must forgo, while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out.  Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a group’s desire to exclude and students’ demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting  all  organizations to express what they wish but  no  group to discriminate in membership.  Pp. 25–28. 
 

      (d) Hastings’ all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral.  Pp. 28–31.  
 

         (1) The policy draws no distinction between groups based on their message or perspective; its requirement that  all  student groups accept  all  comers is textbook viewpoint neutral.  Pp. 28–29. 
 

         (2) Conceding that the policy is nominally neutral, CLS asserts that it systematically—and impermissibly—burdens most heavily those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus mainstream.  This argument fails because “[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.”   Ward  v.  Rock Against Racism ,  491 U. S. 781 , 791.  Hastings’ requirement that RSOs accept all comers, the Court is satisfied, is “justified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the regulated speech.”   Id.,  at 791.  It targets the  act  of rejecting would-be group members without reference to the reasons motivating that behavior.  Pp. 29–31.  
 

   3. Neither lower court addressed CLS’s argument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comers policy.  This Court is not the proper forum to air the issue in the first instance.  On remand, the Ninth Circuit may consider this argument if, and to the extent, it is preserved.  Pp. 31–32. 
 319 Fed. Appx. 645, affirmed and remanded.  
    Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, Kennedy, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., and Kennedy, J., filed concurring opinions.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined.

SNYDER V. PHELPS 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 SNYDER  v . PHELPS et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
 No. 09–751. Argued October 6, 2010—Decided March 2, 2011 
 For the past 20 years, the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church has picketed military funerals to communicate its belief that God hates the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in America’s military.  The church’s picketing has also condemned the Catholic Church for scandals involving its clergy.  Fred Phelps, who founded the church, and six Westboro Baptist parishioners (all relatives of Phelps) traveled to Maryland to picket the funeral of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq in the line of duty.  The picketing took place on public land approximately 1,000 feet from the church where the funeral was held, in accordance with guidance from local law enforcement officers.  The picketers peacefully displayed their signs—stating,  e.g.,  “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,” “Fags Doom Nations,” “America is Doomed,” “Priests Rape Boys,” and “You’re Going to Hell”—for about 30 minutes before the funeral began.  Matthew Snyder’s father (Snyder), petitioner here, saw the tops of the picketers’ signs when driving to the funeral, but did not learn what was written on the signs until watching a news broadcast later that night.   
 

      Snyder filed a diversity action against Phelps, his daughters—who participated in the picketing—and the church (collectively Westboro) alleging, as relevant here, state tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy.  A jury held Westboro liable for millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.  Westboro challenged the verdict as grossly excessive and sought judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the First Amendment fully protected its speech.  The District Court reduced the punitive damages award, but left the verdict otherwise intact.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, concluding that Westboro’s statements were entitled to First Amendment protection because those statements were on matters of public concern, were not provably false, and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric. 
 Held:  The First Amendment shields Westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.  Pp. 5–15. 
    (a) The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment can serve as a defense in state tort suits, including suits for intentional infliction of emotional distress.   Hustler Magazine, Inc.  v.  Falwell ,  485 U. S. 46 , 50-51.  Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding Westboro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is of public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances of the case.  “[S]peech on public issues occupies the ‘ “highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values” ’ and is entitled to special protection.”   Connick  v.  Myers ,  461 U. S. 138 , 145.  Although the boundaries of what constitutes speech on matters of public concern are not well defined, this Court has said that speech is of public concern when it can “be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community,”  id.,  at 146, or when it “is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public,”  San Diego  v.  Roe ,  543 U. S. 77 , 83–84.  A statement’s arguably “inappropriate or controversial character … is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.”   Rankin  v.  McPherson ,  483 U. S. 378 , 387.  Pp. 5–7. 
 

   To determine whether speech is of public or private concern, this Court must independently examine the “ ‘content, form, and context,’ ” of the speech “ ‘as revealed by the whole record.’ ”   Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.  v.  Greenmoss Builders, Inc.,  472 U. S. 749 , 761.    In considering content, form, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it is necessary to evaluate all aspects of the speech.  Pp. 7–8. 
 

   The “content” of Westboro’s signs plainly relates to public, rather than private, matters.  The placards highlighted issues of public import—the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens, the fate of the Nation, homosexuality in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic clergy—and Westboro conveyed its views on those issues in a manner designed to reach as broad a public audience as possible.  Even if a few of the signs were viewed as containing messages related to a particular individual, that would not change the fact that the dominant theme of Westboro’s demonstration spoke to broader public issues.  P. 8. 
 

   The “context” of the speech—its connection with Matthew Snyder’s funeral—cannot by itself transform the nature of Westboro’s speech.  The signs reflected Westboro’s condemnation of much in modern society, and it cannot be argued that Westboro’s use of speech on public issues was in any way contrived to insulate a personal attack on Snyder from liability.  Westboro had been actively engaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became aware of Matthew Snyder, and there can be no serious claim that the picketing did not represent Westboro’s honestly held beliefs on public issues.  Westboro may have chosen the picket location to increase publicity for its views, and its speech may have been particularly hurtful to Snyder.  That does not mean that its speech should be afforded less than full First Amendment protection under the circumstances of this case.  Pp. 8–10. 
 

   That said, “ ‘[e]ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times.’ ”   Frisby  v.  Schultz ,  487 U. S. 474 , 479.  Westboro’s choice of where and when to conduct its picketing is not beyond the Government’s regulatory reach—it is “subject to reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions.”   Clark  v.  Community for Creative Non-Violence ,  468 U. S. 288 , 293.  The facts here are quite different, however, both with respect to the activity being regulated and the means of restricting those activities, from the few limited situations where the Court has concluded that the location of targeted picketing can be properly regulated under provisions deemed content neutral.   Frisby ,  supra,  at 477;  Madsen  v.  Women’s Health Center, Inc. ,  512 U. S. 753 , 768, distinguished.  Maryland now has a law restricting funeral picketing but that law was not in effect at the time of these events, so this Court has no occasion to consider whether that law is a “reasonable time, place, or manner restrictio[n]” under the standards announced by this Court.   Clark ,  supra,  at 293.  Pp. 10–12. 
 

   The “special protection” afforded to what Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it, cannot be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was “outrageous” for purposes of applying the state law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  That would pose too great a danger that the jury would punish Westboro for its views on matters of public concern.  For all these reasons, the jury verdict imposing tort liability on Westboro for intentional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside.  Pp. 12–13. 
 

   (b) Snyder also may not recover for the tort of intrusion upon seclusion.  He argues that he was a member of a captive audience at his son’s funeral, but the captive audience doctrine—which has been applied sparingly, see  Rowan  v.  Post Office Dept. ,  397 U. S. 728 , 736–738;  Frisby ,  supra,  at 484–485—should not be expanded to the circumstances here.  Westboro stayed well away from the memorial service, Snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers’ signs, and there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the funeral service itself.  Pp. 13–14. 
 

   (c) Because the First Amendment bars Snyder from recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclusion—the allegedly unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accomplish—Snyder also cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those torts.  P. 14. 
 

   (d) Westboro addressed matters of public import on public property, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of local officials.  It did not disrupt Mathew Snyder’s funeral, and its choice to picket at that time and place did not alter the nature of its speech.  Because this Nation has chosen to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that public debate is not stifled, Westboro must be shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this case.  Pp. 14–15. 
 580 F. 3d 206, affirmed. 
    Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

NEVADA COMM'N ON ETHICS V. CARRIGAN 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 NEVADA COMMISSION ON ETHICS  v . CARRIGAN 
 certiorari to the supreme court of nevada 
 No. 10–568. Argued April 27, 2011—Decided June 13, 2011 
 Nevada’s Ethics in Government Law requires public officials to recuse themselves from voting on, or advocating the passage or failure of, “a matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in his situation would be materially affected by,”  inter alia , “[h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others,” Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007), which includes a “commitment to a [specified] person,”  e.g.,  a member of the officer’s household or the officer’s relative, §281A.420(8)(a)–(d), and “[a]ny other commitment or relationship that is substantially similar” to one enumerated in paragraphs (a)–(d), §281A.420(8)(e). 
 

      Petitioner (Commission) administers and enforces Nevada’s law.  The Commission investigated respondent Carrigan, an elected local official who voted to approve a hotel/casino project proposed by a company that used Carrigan’s long-time friend and campaign manager as a paid consultant.  The Commission concluded that Carrigan had a disqualifying conflict of interest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall provision, and censured him for failing to abstain from voting on the project.  Carrigan sought judicial review, arguing that the Nevada law violated the First Amendment.  The State District Court denied the petition, but the Nevada Supreme Court reversed, holding that voting is protected speech and that §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall definition is unconstitutionally overbroad.   
 Held:  The Nevada Ethics in Government Law is not unconstitutionally overbroad.  Pp. 3–11. 
    (a) That law prohibits a legislator who has a conflict both from voting on a proposal and from advocating its passage or failure.  If it was constitutional to exclude Carrigan from voting, then his exclusion from advocating during a legislative session was not unconstitutional, for it was a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation.  See  Clark  v.  Community for Creative Non-Violence ,  468 U. S. 288 , 293.  Pp. 3–4. 
 

   (b) “[A] ‘universal and long-established’ tradition of prohibiting certain conduct creates ‘a strong presumption’ that the prohibition is constitutional.’ ”   Republican Party of Minn.  v.  White ,  536 U. S. 765 , 785.  Here, dispositive evidence is provided by “early congressional enactments,” which offer “ ‘contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution’s meaning,’ ”  Printz  v.  United States ,  521 U. S. 898 , 905.  Within 15 years of the founding, both the House and the Senate adopted recusal rules.  Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to judges also date back to the founding.  The notion that Nevada’s recusal rules violate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also inconsistent with long-standing traditions in the States, most of which have some type of recusal law.  Pp. 4–8. 
 

   (c) Restrictions on legislators’ voting are not restrictions on legislators’ protected speech.  A legislator’s vote is the commitment of his apportioned share of the legislature’s power to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal.  He casts his vote “as trustee for his constituents, not as a prerogative of personal power.”   Raines  v.  Byrd ,  521 U. S. 811 , 821.  Moreover, voting is not a symbolic action, and the fact that it is the product of a deeply held or highly unpopular personal belief does not transform it into First Amendment speech.  Even if the mere vote itself could express depth of belief (which it cannot), this Court has rejected the notion that the First Amendment confers a right to use governmental mechanics to convey a message.  See,  e.g., Timmons  v.  Twin Cities Area New Party ,  520 U. S. 351 .   Doe  v.  Reed , 561 U. S. ___, distinguished.  Pp. 8–10. 
 

   (d) The additional arguments raised in Carrigan’s brief were not decided below or raised in his brief in opposition and are thus considered waived.  P. 11. 
 126 Nev. 28, 236 P. 3d 616, reversed and remanded. 
    Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Kennedy, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

BOROUGH OF DURYEA V. GUARNIERI 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 BOROUGH OF DURYEA, PENNSYLVANIA, et al.  v . GUARNIERI 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
 No. 09–1476. Argued March 22, 2011—Decided June 20, 2011 
 After petitioner borough fired respondent Guarnieri as its police chief, he filed a union grievance that led to his reinstatement.  When the borough council later issued directives instructing Guarnieri how to perform his duties, he filed a second grievance, and an arbitrator ordered that some of the directives be modified or withdrawn.  Guarnieri then filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging   that the directives were issued in retaliation for the filing of his first grievance, thereby violating his First Amendment “right … to petition the Government for a redress of grievances”; he later amended his complaint to allege that the council also violated the Petition Clause by denying his request for overtime pay in retaliation for his having filed the §1983 suit.  The District Court instructed the jury,  inter alia,  that the suit and the grievances were constitutionally protected activity, and the jury found for Guarnieri.  Affirming the compensatory damages award, the Third Circuit held that a public employee who has petitioned the government through a formal mechanism such as the filing of a lawsuit or grievance is protected under the Petition Clause from retaliation for that activity, even if the petition concerns a matter of solely private concern.  In so ruling, the court rejected the view of every other Circuit to have considered the issue that, to be protected, the petition must address a matter of public concern.   
 Held:  A government employer’s allegedly retaliatory actions against an employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless the employee’s petition relates to a matter of public concern.  The Third Circuit’s conclusion that the public concern test does not limit public employees’ Petition Clause claims is incorrect.  Pp. 4–19. 
    (a) A public employee suing his employer under the First Amendment’s Speech Clause must show that he spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.   Connick  v.  Myers ,  461 U. S. 138 , 147.  Even where the employee makes that showing, however, courts balance his employee’s right to engage in speech against the government’s interest in promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the public services it performs through its employees.   Pickering  v.  Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty. ,  391 U. S. 563 , 568.  Although cases might arise in which special Petition Clause concerns would require a distinct analysis, public employees’ retaliation claims do not call for this divergence.  The close connection between the rights of speech and petition has led Courts of Appeals other than the Third Circuit to apply the public concern test to public employees’ Petition Clause claims.  This approach is justified by the substantial common ground in the definition and delineation of these rights.  Pp.  4–8. 
 

   (b) The substantial government interests that justify a cautious and restrained approach to protecting public employees’ speech are just as relevant in Petition Clause cases.  A petition, no less than speech, can interfere with government’s efficient and effective operation by,  e.g.,  seeking results that “contravene governmental policies or impair the proper performance of governmental functions,”  Garcetti  v.  Ceballos,   547 U. S. 410 , 419.  A petition taking the form of a lawsuit against the government employer may be particularly disruptive, consuming public officials’ time and attention, burdening their exercise of legitimate authority, and blurring the lines of accountability between them and the public.  Here, for example, Guarnieri’s attorney invited the jury to review myriad details of government decisionmaking.  It is precisely to avoid this sort of intrusion into internal governmental affairs that this Court has held that, “while the First Amendment invests public employees with certain rights, it does not empower them to ‘constitutionalize the employee grievance.’ ”   Id.,  at 420.  Interpreting the Petition Clause to apply even where matters of public concern are not involved would be unnecessary, or even disruptive, when there is already protection for the public employees’ rights to file grievances and litigate.  Adopting a different rule for Petition Clause claims would provide a ready means for public employees to circumvent the public concern test’s protections and aggravate potential harm to the government’s interests by compounding the costs of complying with the Constitution.  Pp. 8–13. 
 

   (c) Guarnieri’s claim that applying the public concern test to the Petition Clause would be inappropriate in light of the private nature of many petitions for redress lacks merit.  Although the Clause undoubtedly has force and application in the context of a personal grievance addressed to the government, petitions to the government assume an added dimension when they seek to advance political, social, or other ideas of interest to the community as a whole.  The Clause’s history reveals the frequent use of petitions to address a wide range of political, social, and other matters of great public import and interest.  Pp. 13–17. 
 

   (d) The framework used to govern public employees’ Speech Clause claims, when applied to the Petition Clause, will protect both the government’s interests and the employee’s First Amendment right.  If a public employee petitions as an employee on a matter of purely private concern, his First Amendment interest must give way, as it does in speech cases.   San Diego  v.  Roe ,  543 U. S. 77 , 82–83.  If he petitions as a citizen on a matter of public concern, his First Amendment interest must be balanced against the government’s countervailing interest in the effective and efficient management of its internal affairs.   Pickering, supra , at 568.    If that balance favors the public employee, the First Amendment claim will be sustained.  If the balance favors the employer, the employee’s First Amendment claim will fail even though the petition is on a matter of public concern.  As under the Speech Clause, whether a petition relates to a matter of public concern will depend on its “content, form, and context … , as revealed by the whole record.”   Connick, supra , at 147–148, n. 7.  The forum in which a petition is lodged will also be relevant.  See  Snyder  v.  Phelps , 562 U. S. ___, ___.  A petition filed with a government employer using an internal grievance procedure in many cases will not seek to communicate to the public or to advance a political or social point of view beyond the employment context.  Pp. 17–18.  
 

   (e) Absent full briefs by the parties, the Court need not consider how the foregoing framework would apply to this case.  P. 19. 
 364 Fed. Appx. 749, vacated and remanded.   
    Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

SORRELL V. IMS HEALTH INC. 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 SORRELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VERMONT, et al.  v . IMS HEALTH INC. et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
 No. 10–779. Argued April 26, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011 
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to doctors through a process called “detailing.”  Pharmacies receive “prescriber-identifying information” when processing prescriptions and sell the information to “data miners,” who produce reports on prescriber behavior and lease their reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers.  “Detailers” employed by pharmaceutical manufacturers then use the reports to refine their marketing tactics and increase sales to doctors.  Vermont’s Prescription Confidentiality Law provides that, absent the prescriber’s consent, prescriber-identifying information may not be sold by pharmacies and similar entities, disclosed by those entities for marketing purposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical manufacturers.  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §4631(d).  The prohibitions are subject to exceptions that permit the prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and used for a number of purposes,  e.g.,  “health care research.”  §4631(e). 
 

      Respondents, Vermont data miners and an association of brand-name drug manufacturers, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials (hereinafter Vermont), contending that §4631(d) violates their rights under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  The District Court denied relief, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that §4631(d) unconstitutionally burdens the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data miners without adequate justification. 
 Held : 
    1. Vermont’s statute, which imposes content- and speaker-based burdens on protected expression, is subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.  Pp. 6–15. 
 

      (a) On its face, the law enacts a content- and speaker-based restriction on the sale, disclosure, and use of prescriber-identifying information.  The law first forbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the content of a purchaser’s speech.  It then bars pharmacies from disclosing the information when recipient speakers will use that information for marketing.  Finally, it prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from using the information for marketing.  The statute thus disfavors marketing,  i.e.,  speech with a particular content, as well as particular speakers , i.e. , detailers engaged in marketing on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers.   Cincinnati  v.  Discovery Network, Inc. ,  507 U. S. 410 , 426;  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.  v.  FCC ,  512 U. S. 622 , 658.  Yet the law allows prescriber-identifying information to be purchased, acquired, and used for other types of speech and by other speakers.  The record and formal legislative findings of purpose confirm that §4631(d) imposes an aimed, content-based burden on detailers, in particular detailers who promote brand-name drugs.  In practical operation, Vermont’s law “goes even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.”   R. A. V.  v.  St. Paul ,  505 U. S. 377 , 391.  Heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted.  Pp. 8–11. 
 

      (b) Vermont errs in arguing that heightened scrutiny is unwarranted.  The State contends that its law is a mere commercial regulation.  Far from having only an incidental effect on speech, however, §4631(d) imposes a burden based on the content of speech and the identity of the speaker.  The State next argues that, because prescriber-identifying information was generated in compliance with a legal mandate, §4631(d) is akin to a restriction on access to government-held information.  That argument finds some support in  Los Angeles Police Dept.  v.  United Reporting Publishing Corp. ,  528 U. S. 32 , but that case is distinguishable.  Vermont has imposed a restriction on access to information in private hands.   United Reporting  reserved that situation— i.e.,  “a case in which the government is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses.”   Id.,  at 40.  In addition, the  United Reporting  plaintiff was presumed to have suffered no personal First Amendment injury, while respondents claim that §4631(d) burdens their own speech.  That circumstance warrants heightened scrutiny.  Vermont also argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted because sales, transfer, and use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct, not speech.  However, the creation and dissemination of information are speech for First Amendment purposes.  See,  e.g. ,  Bartnicki  v.  Vopper ,  532 U. S. 514 , 527.  There is no need to consider Vermont’s request for an exception to that rule.  Section 4631(d) imposes a speaker- and content-based burden on protected expression, and that circumstance is sufficient to justify applying heightened scrutiny, even assuming that prescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.  Pp. 11–15. 
 

   2. Vermont’s justifications for §4631(d) do not withstand heightened scrutiny.  Pp. 15–24. 
 

      (a) The outcome here is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied, see,  e.g. ,  Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc.  v.  United States ,  527 U. S. 173 , 184.  To sustain §4631(d)’s targeted, content-based burden on protected expression, Vermont must show at least that the statute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest.  See  Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox,  492 U. S. 469 , 480–481.  Vermont contends that its law (1) is necessary to protect medical privacy, including physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment, and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, and (2) is integral to the achievement of the policy objectives of improving public health and reducing healthcare costs.  Pp. 15–17. 
 

      (b) Assuming that physicians have an interest in keeping their prescription decisions confidential, §4631(d) is not drawn to serve that interest.  Pharmacies may share prescriber-identifying information with anyone for any reason except for marketing.  Vermont might have addressed physician confidentiality through “a more coherent policy,”  Greater New Orleans Broadcasting ,  supra , at 195, such as allowing the information’s sale or disclosure in only a few narrow and well-justified circumstances.  But it did not. Given the information’s widespread availability and many permissible uses, Vermont’s asserted interest in physician confidentiality cannot justify the burdens that §4631(d) imposes on protected expression.  It is true that doctors can forgo the law’s advantages by consenting to the sale, disclosure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information.  But the State has offered only a contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow the doctor’s prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which will allow the information to be used by those speakers whose message the State supports.  Cf.  Rowan  v.  Post Office Dept. ,  397 U. S. 728 .  Respondents suggest a further defect lies in §4631(d)’s presumption of applicability absent an individual election to the contrary.  Reliance on a prior election, however, would not save a privacy measure that imposed an unjustified burden on protected expression.  Vermont also asserts that its broad content-based rule is necessary to avoid harassment, but doctors can simply decline to meet with detailers.  Cf.  Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc.  v.  Village of Stratton ,  536 U. S. 150 , 168.  Vermont further argues that detailers’ use of prescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor-patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment decisions.  But if pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment decisions, it can do so only because it is persuasive.  Fear that speech might persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it.  Pp. 17–21. 
 

      (c) While Vermont’s goals of lowering the costs of medical services and promoting public health may be proper, §4631(d) does not advance them in a permissible way.  Vermont seeks to achieve those objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain speakers— i.e.,  by diminishing detailers’ ability to influence prescription decisions.  But   “the fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information” cannot justify content-based burdens on speech.   Thompson  v.  Western States Medical Center ,  535 U. S. 357 , 374.  That precept applies with full force when the audience—here, prescribing physicians—consists of “sophisticated and experienced” consumers.   Edenfield  v.  Fane ,  507 U. S. 761 , 775.  The instant law’s defect is made clear by the fact that many listeners find detailing instructive.  Vermont may be displeased that detailers with prescriber-indentifying information are effective in promoting brand-name drugs, but the State may not burden protected expression in order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction.  Vermont nowhere contends that its law will prevent false or misleading speech within the meaning of this Court’s First Amendment precedents.  The State’s interest in burdening detailers’ speech thus turns on nothing more than a difference of opinion.  Pp. 21–24.

BROWN V. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN. 
 
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 BROWN, GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, et al.  v .
ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 08–1448. Argued November 2, 2010—Decided June 27, 2011 
 Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.  The Federal District Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.   
 Held:  The Act does not comport with the First Amendment.  Pp. 2–18. 
    (a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection.  Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium.  And “the basic principles of freedom of speech … do not vary” with a new and different communication medium.   Joseph Burstyn, Inc.  v.  Wilson ,  343 U. S. 495 , 503.  The most basic principle—that government lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas, subject matter, or content,  Ashcroft  v.  American Civil Liberties Union ,  535 U. S. 564 , 573—is subject to a few limited exceptions for historically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fighting words.  But a legislature cannot create new categories of unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the test.  See  United States  v.  Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Unlike the New York law upheld in  Ginsberg  v.  New York ,  390 U. S. 629 , California’s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children.  Instead, the State wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.  That is unprecedented and mistaken.  This country has no tradition of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence.  And California’s claim that “interactive” video games present special problems, in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome, is unpersuasive.  Pp. 2–11. 
 

   (b) Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny,  i.e.,  it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.   R. A. V.  v.  St. Paul ,  505 U. S. 377 , 395.  California cannot meet that standard.  Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes   minors to act   aggressively.  Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media.  Since California has declined to restrict those other media,  e.g.,  Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.  California also cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent videos.  The video-game industry’s voluntary rating system already accomplishes that to a large extent.  Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are prohibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who disapprove of their doing so.  The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.    Pp. 11–18. 
 556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
 ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM CLUB PAC et al.  v . BENNETT, SECRETARY OF
STATE OF ARIZONA, et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 10–238. Argued March 28, 2011—Decided June 27, 2011 
 The Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act created a public financing system to fund the primary and general election campaigns of candidates for state office.  Candidates who opt to participate, and who accept certain campaign restrictions and obligations, are granted an initial outlay of public funds to conduct their campaign.  They are also granted additional matching funds if a privately financed candidate’s expenditures, combined with the expenditures of independent groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the publicly financed candidate’s initial state allotment.  Once matching funds are triggered, a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for every dollar raised or spent by the privately financed candidate—including any money of his own that a privately financed candidate spends on his campaign—and for every dollar spent by independent groups that support the privately financed candidate.  When there are multiple publicly financed candidates in a race, each one receives matching funds as a result of the spending of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Matching funds top out at two times the initial grant to the publicly financed candidate. 
 

      Petitioners, past and future Arizona candidates and two independent expenditure groups that spend money to support and oppose Arizona candidates, challenged the constitutionality of the matching funds provision, arguing that it unconstitutionally penalizes their speech and burdens their ability to fully exercise their First Amendment rights.  The District Court entered a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the matching funds provision.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the provision imposed only a minimal burden and that the burden was justified by Arizona’s interest in reducing  quid pro quo  political corruption. 
 Held:  Arizona’s matching funds scheme substantially burdens political speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest to survive First Amendment scrutiny.  Pp. 8–30. 
    (a) The matching funds provision imposes a substantial burden on the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Pp. 8–22. 
 

      (1) Petitioners contend that their political speech is substantially burdened in the same way that speech was burdened by the so-called “Millionaire’s Amendment” of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which was invalidated in  Davis  v.  Federal Election Comm’n ,  554 U. S. 724 .  That law—which permitted the opponent of a candidate who spent over $350,000 of his personal funds to collect triple the normal contribution amount, while the candidate who spent the personal funds remained subject to the original contribution cap—unconstitutionally forced a candidate “to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.”   Id.,  at 739.  This “unprecedented penalty” “impose[d] a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech” that was not justified by a compelling government interest.   Id. , at 739–740.  Pp. 8–10. 
 

      (2) The logic of  Davis  largely controls here.  Once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent more than the State’s initial grant to a publicly financed candidate, each personal dollar the privately financed candidate spends results in an award of almost one additional dollar to his opponent.  The privately financed candidate must “shoulder a special and potentially significant burden” when choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on his own candidacy.  554 U. S., at 739.  If the law at issue in  Davis  imposed a burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unquestionably does so as well. 
 

   The differences between the matching funds provision and the law struck down in  Davis  make the Arizona law  more  constitutionally problematic, not less.  First, the penalty in  Davis  consisted of raising the contribution limits for one candidate, who would still have to raise the additional funds.  Here, the direct and automatic release of public money to a publicly financed candidate imposes a far heavier burden.  Second, in elections where there are multiple publicly financed candidates—a frequent occurrence in Arizona—the matching funds provision can create a multiplier effect.  Each dollar spent by the privately funded candidate results in an additional dollar of funding to each of that candidate’s publicly financed opponents.  Third, unlike the law in  Davis , all of this is to some extent out of the privately financed candidate’s hands.  Spending by independent expenditure groups to promote a privately financed candidate’s election triggers matching funds, regardless whether such support is welcome or helpful.  Those funds go directly to the publicly funded candidate to use as he sees fit.  That disparity in control—giving money directly to a publicly financed candidate, in response to independent expenditures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded candidate—is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.   
 

   The burdens that matching funds impose on independent expenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed candidates themselves.  The more money spent on behalf of a privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate, the more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the State.  The effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes, and spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple candidates.  In some ways, the burdens imposed on independent groups by matching funds are more severe than the burdens imposed on privately financed candidates.  Independent groups, of course, are not eligible for public financing.  As a result, those groups can only avoid matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to speak altogether.  Presenting independent expenditure groups with such a choice—trigger matching funds, change your message, or do not speak—makes the matching funds provision particularly burdensome to those groups and certainly contravenes “the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.”   Hurley  v.  Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc .,  515 U. S. 557 , 573.  Pp. 10–14. 
 

      (3) The arguments of Arizona, the Clean Elections Institute, and  amicus  United States attempting to explain away the existence or significance of any burden imposed by matching funds are unpersuasive.   
 

   Arizona correctly points out that its law is different from the law invalidated in  Davis,  but there is no doubt that the burden on speech is significantly greater here than in  Davis.   Arizona argues that the provision actually creates more speech.  But even if that were the case, only the speech of publicly financed candidates is increased by the state law.  And burdening the speech of some—here privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups—to increase the speech of others is a concept “wholly foreign to the First Amendment,”  Buckley  v.  Valeo ,  424 U. S. 1 , 48–49; cf.  Miami Herald Publishing Co.  v.  Tornillo ,  418 U. S. 241 , 244, 258.  That no candidate or group is forced to express a particular message does not mean that the matching funds provision does not burden their speech, especially since the direct result of that speech is a state-provided monetary subsidy to a political rival.  And precedents upholding government subsidies against First Amendment challenge provide no support for matching funds; none of the subsidies at issue in those cases were granted in response to the speech of another. 
 

   The burden on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups also cannot be analogized to the burden placed on speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements upheld in  Citizens United  v.  Federal Election Comm’n , 558 U. S. ___.  A political candidate’s disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a cash windfall to his opponent, or affect their respective disclosure obligations. 
 

   The burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Indeed every court to have considered the question after  Davis  has concluded that a candidate or independent group might not spend money if the direct result of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries.  Arizona is correct that the candidates do not complain that providing a lump sum payment equivalent to the maximum state financing that a candidate could obtain through matching funds would be impermissible.  But it is not the amount of funding that the State provides that is constitutionally problematic.  It is the manner in which that funding is provided—in direct response to the political speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Pp. 14–22. 
 

   (b) Arizona’s matching funds provision is not “ ‘justified by a compelling state interest,’ ”  Davis ,  supra,  at 740.  Pp. 22–28. 
 

      (1) There is ample support for the argument that the purpose of the matching funds provision is to “level the playing field” in terms of candidate resources.  The clearest evidence is that the provision operates to ensure that campaign funding is equal, up to three times the initial public funding allotment.  The text of the Arizona Act confirms this purpose.  The provision setting up the matching funds regime is titled “Equal funding of candidates,” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §16–952; and the Act and regulations refer to the funds as “equalizing funds,”  e.g.,  §16–952(C)(4).  This Court has repeatedly rejected the argument that the government has a compelling state interest in “leveling the playing field” that can justify undue burdens on political speech, see,  e.g.,   Citizens United ,  supra,  at ___, and the burdens imposed by matching funds cannot be justified by the pursuit of such an interest.  Pp. 22–25. 
 

      (2) Even if the objective of the matching funds provision is to combat corruption—and not “level the playing field”—the burdens that the matching funds provision imposes on protected political speech are not justified.  Burdening a candidate’s expenditure of his own funds on his own campaign does not further the State’s anticorruption interest.  Indeed, “reliance on personal funds  reduces  the threat of corruption.”   Davis ,  supra , at 740–741; see  Buckley ,  supra , at 53.  The burden on independent expenditures also cannot be supported by the anticorruption interest.  Such expenditures are “political speech … not coordinated with a candidate.”   Citizens United , 558 U. S., at ___.  That separation negates the possibility that the expenditures will result in the sort of  quid pro quo  corruption with which this Court’s case law is concerned.  See  e.g., id.,  at ___–___.  Moreover, “[t]he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by … contribution limitations.”   Buckley, supra,  at 55.  Given Arizona’s contribution limits, some of the most austere in the Nation, its strict disclosure requirements, and the general availability of public funding, it is hard to imagine what marginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching funds provision. 
 

   The State and the Clean Elections Institute contend that even if the matching funds provision does not directly serve the anticorruption interest, it indirectly does so by ensuring that enough candidates participate in the State’s public funding system, which in turn helps combat corruption.  But the fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech might indirectly serve the State’s anticorruption interest, by encouraging candidates to take public financing, does not establish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision.  The matching funds provision substantially burdens speech, to an even greater extent than the law invalidated in  Davis .  Those burdens cannot be justified by a desire to “level the playing field,” and much of the speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not pose a danger of corruption.  The fact that the State may feel that the matching funds provision is necessary to allow it to calibrate its public funding system to achieve its desired level of participation—without an undue drain on public resources—is not a sufficient justification for the burden.   
 

   The flaw in the State’s argument is apparent in what its reasoning would allow.  By the State’s logic it could award publicly financed candidates five dollars for every dollar spent by a privately financed candidate, or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a $10,000 fine, in order to encourage participation in the public funding regime.  Such measures might well promote such participation, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political speech.  How the State chooses to encourage participation in its public funding system matters, and the Court has never held that a State may burden political speech—to the extent the matching funds provision does—to ensure adequate participation in a public funding system.  Pp. 25–28. 
 

   (c) Evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy is not the Court’s business.  But determining whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amendment is.  The government “may engage in public financing of election campaigns,” and doing so can further “significant governmental interest[s].”   Buckley , 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92–93, 96.  But the goal of creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a manner consistent with the First Amendment.  Arizona’s program gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.  It does this when the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State.  This goes too far; Arizona’s matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.  Pp. 28–30.

				The Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime to falsely claim receipt of military decorations or medals and provides an enhanced penalty if the Congressional Medal of Honor is involved.  18 U. S. C. §§704 (b), (c).  Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely claiming that he had received the Medal of Honor, but reserved his right to appeal his claim that the Act is unconstitutional.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding the Act invalid under the 
 
First Amendment.
			 
 
				Held: The judgment is affirmed.  Pp. 3−18.
			 
 
				617 F. 3d 1198, affirmed.
			 
 
				
				    
				Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Sotomayor, concluded that the Act infringes upon speech protected by the 
 
First Amendment.  Pp. 3–18.
			 
 
				
				    
				(a) The Constitution “demands that content-based restrictions on speech be presumed invalid . . . and that the Government bear the burden of showing their constitutionality.”  Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 

542 U. S. 656
.
			 
 
				
				    
				Content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted only for a few historic categories of speech, including incitement, obscenity, defamation, speech integral to criminal conduct, so-called “fighting words,” child pornography, fraud, true threats, and speech presenting some grave and imminent threat the Government has the power to prevent.
			 
 
				
				    
				Absent from these few categories is any general exception for false statements.  The Government argues that cases such as Hustler Magazine, Inc., v. Falwell, 

485 U. S. 46
, support its claim that false statements have no value and hence no 
 
First Amendment protection.  But all the Government’s quotations derive from cases discussing defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm associated with a false statement.  In those decisions the falsity of the speech at issue was not irrelevant to the Court’s analysis, but neither was it determinative.  These prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing more.
			 
 
				
				    
				Even when considering some instances of defamation or fraud, the Court has instructed that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the speech outside the 
 
First Amendment; the statement must be a knowing and reckless falsehood.  See New York Times v. Sullivan, 

376 U. S. 254
.  Here, the Government seeks to convert a rule that limits liability even in defamation cases where the law permits recovery for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a different, far greater realm of discourse and expression.
			 
 
				
				    
				The Government’s three examples of false-speech regulation that courts generally have found permissible do not establish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements are exempt from rigorous 
 
First Amendment scrutiny.  The criminal prohibition of a false statement made to Government officials in communications concerning official matters, 

18 U. S. C. §1001, does not lead to the broader proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any person, at any time, in any context.  As for perjury statutes, perjured statements lack 
 
First Amendment protection not simply because they are false, but because perjury undermines the function and province of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments.  Finally, there are statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on behalf of the Government, or prohibit impersonating a Government officer.  These examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.
			 
 
				
				    
				While there may exist “some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected,” but that the Court has not yet specifically identified or discussed, United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___, the Government has not demonstrated that false statements should constitute a new category.  Pp. 3−10.
			 
 
				
				    
				(b) The Act seeks to control and suppress all false statements on this one subject in almost limitless times and settings without regard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain.  Permitting the Government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable.  That governmental power has no clear limiting principle.  Pp. 10−11.
			 
 
				
				    
				(c) The Court applies the “most exacting scrutiny” in assessing content-based restrictions on protected speech.  Turner Broadcasting System Inc. v. FCC, 

512 U. S. 622
.  The Act does not satisfy that scrutiny.  While the Government’s interest in protecting the integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond question, the 
 
First Amendment requires that there be a direct causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be prevented.  Here, that link has not been shown.  The Government points to no evidence supporting its claim that the public’s general perception of military awards is diluted by false claims such as those made by respondent.  And it has not shown, and cannot show, why counterspeech, such as the ridicule respondent received online and in the press, would not suffice to achieve its interest.
			 
 
				
				    
				In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected speech, the restriction must be the “least restrictive means among available, effective alternatives.”  Ashcroft, 542 U. S., at 666.  Here, the Government could likely protect the integrity of the military awards system by creating a database of Medal winners accessible and searchable on the Internet, as some private individuals have already done.  Pp. 12−18.
			 
 
				
				    
				Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Kagan, concluded that because the Stolen Valor Act, as presently drafted, works disproportionate constitutional harm, it fails intermediate scrutiny, and thus violates the 
 
First Amendment.  Pp. 1−10.
			 
 
				
				    
				(a) In determining whether a statute violates the 
 
First Amendment, the Court has often found it appropriate to examine the fit between statutory ends and means, taking into account the seriousness of the speech-related harm the provision will likely cause, the nature and importance of the provision’s countervailing objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive alternatives.  “Intermediate scrutiny” describes this approach.  Since false factual statements are less likely than true factual statements to make a valuable contribution to the marketplace of ideas, and the government often has good reason to prohibit such false speech, but its regulation can threaten speech-related harm, such an approach is applied here.  Pp. 1−3.
			 
 
				
				    
				(b) The Act should be read as criminalizing only false factual statements made with knowledge of their falsity and with intent that they be taken as true.  Although the Court has frequently said or implied that false factual statements enjoy little 
 
First Amendment protection, see, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 

418 U. S. 323
, those statements cannot be read to mean “no protection at all.”  False factual statements serve useful human objectives in many contexts.  Moreover, the threat of criminal prosecution for making a false statement can inhibit the speaker from making true statements, thereby “chilling” a kind of speech that lies at the 
 
First Amendment’s heart.  See id., at 340−341.  And the pervasiveness of false factual statements provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to prosecute falsity without more.  Those who are unpopular may fear that the government will use that weapon selectively against them.
			 
 
				
				    
				Although there are many statutes and common-law doctrines making the utterance of certain kinds of false statements unlawful, they tend to be narrower than the Act, in that they limit the scope of their application in various ways, for example, by requiring proof of specific harm to identifiable victims.  The Act lacks any such limiting features.  Although it prohibits only knowing and intentional falsehoods about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the speaker, it otherwise ranges broadly, and that breadth means that it creates a significant risk of 
 
First Amendment harm.  Pp. 3−8.
			 
 
				
				    
				(c) The Act nonetheless has substantial justification.  It seeks to protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their health and life for their country by seeking to preserve intact the country’s recognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors.  P. 8.
			 
 
				
				    
				(d) It may, however, be possible substantially to achieve the Government’s objective in less burdensome ways.  The 
 
First Amendment risks flowing from the Act’s breadth of coverage could be diminished or eliminated by a more finely tailored statute, for example, a statute that requires a showing that the false statement caused specific harm or is focused on lies more likely to be harmful or on contexts where such lies are likely to cause harm.  Pp. 8−10.

				In the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act), 

22 U. S. C. §7601 et seq., Congress has authorized the appropriation of billions of dollars to fund efforts by nongovernmental organizations to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide.  The Act imposes two related conditions: (1) No funds “may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution,” §7631(e); and (2) no funds may be used by an organization “that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution,” §7631(f).  To enforce the second condition, known as the Policy Requirement, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) require funding recipients to agree in their award documents that they oppose prostitution.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				Respondents, recipients of Leadership Act funds who wish to remain neutral on prostitution, sought a declaratory judgment that the Policy Requirement violates their 
 
First Amendment rights.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction, barring the Government from cutting off respondents’ Leadership Act funding during the litigation or from otherwise taking action based on their privately funded speech.  The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Policy Requirement, as implemented by the agencies, violated respondents’ freedom of speech.  
			 
 
				Held: The Policy Requirement violates the 
 
First Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.  Pp. 6–15.
			 
 
				
				    
				(a) The Policy Requirement mandates that recipients of federal funds explicitly agree with the Government’s policy to oppose prostitution.  The 
 
First Amendment, however, “prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.”  Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 

547 U. S. 47
.  As a direct regulation, the Policy Requirement would plainly violate the 
 
First Amendment.  The question is whether the Government may nonetheless impose that requirement as a condition of federal funding.  Pp. 6–7.
			 
 
				
				    
				(b) The Spending Clause grants Congress broad discretion to fund private programs or activities for the “general Welfare,” Art. I, §8, cl. 1, including authority to impose limits on the use of such funds to ensure they are used in the manner Congress intends.  Rust v. Sullivan, 

500 U. S. 173
, n. 4.  As a general matter, if a party objects to those limits, its recourse is to decline the funds.  In some cases, however, a funding condition can result in an unconstitutional burden on 
 
First Amendment rights.  The distinction that has emerged from this Court’s cases is between conditions that define the limits of the Government spending program—those that specify the activities Congress wants to subsidize—and conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the federal program itself.  
			 
 
				
				    
				Rust illustrates the distinction.  In that case, the Court considered Title X of the Public Health Service Act, which authorized grants to health-care organizations offering family planning services, but prohibited federal funds from being “used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.”  500 U. S., at 178.  To enforce the provision, HHS regulations barred Title X projects from advocating abortion and required grantees to keep their Title X projects separate from their other projects.  The regulations were valid, the Court explained, because they governed only the scope of the grantee’s Title X projects, leaving the grantee free to engage in abortion advocacy through programs that were independent from its Title X projects.  Because the regulations did not prohibit speech “outside the scope of the federally funded program,” they did not run afoul of the 
 
First Amendment.  Id., at 197.  Pp. 7–11.
			 
 
				
				    
				(c) The distinction between conditions that define a federal program and those that reach outside it is not always self-evident, but the Court is confident that the Policy Requirement falls on the unconstitutional side of the line.  To begin, the Leadership Act’s other funding condition, which prohibits Leadership Act funds from being used “to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking,” §7631(e), ensures that federal funds will not be used for prohibited purposes.  The Policy Requirement thus must be doing something more—and it is.  By demanding that funding recipients adopt and espouse, as their own, the Government’s view on an issue of public concern, the Policy Requirement by its very nature affects “protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.”  Rust, supra, at 197.  A recipient cannot avow the belief dictated by the condition when spending Leadership Act funds, and assert a contrary belief when participating in activities on its own time and dime. 
			 
 
				
				    
				The Government suggests that if funding recipients could promote or condone prostitution using private funds, “it would undermine the government’s program and confuse its message opposing prostitution.”  Brief for Petitioners 37.  But the Policy Requirement goes beyond preventing recipients from using private funds in a way that would undermine the federal program.  It requires them to pledge allegiance to the Government’s policy of eradicating prostitution.  That condition on funding violates the 
 
First Amendment.  Pp. 11–15.
			 
 
				651 F. 3d 218, affirmed.
			 
 
				
				    
				Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Thomas, J., joined.  Kagan, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

				No. 12–536. Argued October 8, 2013—Decided April 2, 2014
			 
 
				The right to participate in democracy through political contributions is protected by the 
 
First Amendment, but that right is not absolute.  Congress may regulate campaign contributions to protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption.  See, e.g., Buckley v. Valeo, 

424 U. S. 1
–27.  It may not, however, regulate contributions simply to reduce the amount of money in politics, or to restrict the political participation of some in order to enhance the relative influence of others.  See, e.g., Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U. S. ___, ___.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), imposes two types of limits on campaign contributions.  Base limits restrict how much money a donor may contribute to a particular candidate or committee while aggregate limits restrict how much money a donor may contribute in total to all candidates or committees.  

2 U. S. C. §441a.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				In the 2011–2012 election cycle, appellant McCutcheon contributed to 16 different federal candidates, complying with the base limits applicable to each.  He alleges that the aggregate limits prevented him from contributing to 12 additional candidates and to a number of noncandidate political committees.  He also alleges that he wishes to make similar contributions in the future, all within the base limits.  McCutcheon and appellant Republican National Committee filed a complaint before a three-judge District Court, asserting that the aggregate limits were unconstitutional under the 
 
First Amendment.  The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the Government’s motion to dismiss.  Assuming that the base limits appropriately served the Government’s anticorruption interest, the District Court concluded that the aggregate limits survived 
 
First Amendment scrutiny because they prevented evasion of the base limits.  
			 
 
				Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
			 
 
				893 F. Supp. 2d 133, reversed and remanded.
			 
 
				
				    
				Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito, concluded that the aggregate limits are invalid under the 
 
First Amendment.  Pp. 7–40.
			 
 
				
				    
				(a) Appellants’ substantial 
 
First Amendment challenge to the current system of aggregate limits merits plenary consideration.  Pp. 7–14.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				(1) In Buckley, this Court evaluated the constitutionality of the original contribution and expenditure limits in FECA.  Buckley distinguished the two types of limits based on the degree to which each encroaches upon protected 
 
First Amendment interests.  It subjected expenditure limits to “the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core 
 
First Amendment rights of political expression.”  424 U. S., at 44–45.  But it concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser restraint on political speech and thus applied a lesser but still “rigorous standard of review,” id., at 29, under which such limits “may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms,” id., at 25.  Because the Court found that the primary purpose of FECA—preventing quid pro quo corruption and its appearance—was a “sufficiently important” governmental interest, id., at 26–27, it upheld the base limit under the “closely drawn” test, id., at 29.  After doing so, the Court devoted only one paragraph of its 139-page opinion to the aggregate limit then in place under FECA, noting that the provision “ha[d] not been separately addressed at length by the parties.”  Id., at 38.  It concluded that the aggregate limit served to prevent circumvention of the base limit and was “no more than a corollary” of that limit.  Id., at 38.  Pp. 7–9.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				(2) There is no need in this case to revisit Buckley’s distinction between contributions and expenditures and the corresponding distinction in standards of review.  Regardless whether strict scrutiny or the “closely drawn” test applies, the analysis turns on the fit between the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve that objective.  Here, given the substantial mismatch between the Government’s stated objective and the means selected to achieve it, the aggregate limits fail even under the “closely drawn” test.  
			 
 
				
				    
				Buckley’s ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the aggregate limit in place under FECA does not control here.  Buckley spent just three sentences analyzing that limit, which had not been separately addressed by the parties.  Appellants here, by contrast, have directly challenged the aggregate limits in place under BCRA, a different statutory regime whose limits operate against a distinct legal backdrop.  Most notably, statutory safeguards against circumvention have been considerably strengthened since Buckley.  The 1976 FECA Amendments added another layer of base limits—capping contributions from individuals to political committees—and an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.  Since Buckley, the Federal Election Commission has also enacted an intricate regulatory scheme that further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base limits through “unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute” to a particular candidate.  424 U. S., at 38.  In addition to accounting for such statutory and regulatory changes, appellants raise distinct legal arguments not considered in Buckley, including an overbreadth challenge to the aggregate limit.  Pp. 10–14.
			 
 
				
				    
				(b) Significant 
 
First Amendment interests are implicated here.  Contributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individual’s right to participate in the electoral process through both political expression and political association.  A restriction on how many candidates and committees an individual may support is hardly a “modest restraint” on those rights.  The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.  In its simplest terms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits.  And it is no response to say that the individual can simply contribute less than the base limits permit: To require one person to contribute at lower levels because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to penalize that individual for “robustly exercis[ing]” his 
 
First Amendment rights.  Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 

554 U. S. 724
. 
			 
 
				
				    
				In assessing the 
 
First Amendment interests at stake, the proper focus is on an individual’s right to engage in political speech, not a collective conception of the public good.  The whole point of the 
 
First Amendment is to protect individual speech that the majority might prefer to restrict, or that legislators or judges might not view as useful to the democratic process.  Pp. 14–18.
			 
 
				
				    
				(c) The aggregate limits do not further the permissible governmental interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.  Pp. 18–36.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				(1) This Court has identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting campaign finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.  See Davis, supra, at 741.  Moreover, the only type of corruption that Congress may target is quid pro quo corruption.  Spending large sums of money in connection with elections, but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholder’s official duties, does not give rise to quid pro quo corruption.  Nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner “influence over or access to” elected officials or political parties.  Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 

558 U. S. 310
.  The line between quid pro quo corruption and general influence must be respected in order to safeguard basic 
 
First Amendment rights, and the Court must “err on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it.”  Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, 

551 U. S. 449
 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.).  Pp. 18–21.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				(2) The Government argues that the aggregate limits further the permissible objective of preventing quid pro quo corruption.  The difficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in, they ban all contributions of any amount, even though Congress’s selection of a base limit indicates its belief that contributions beneath that amount do not create a cognizable risk of corruption.  The Government must thus defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent circumvention of the base limits, a function they do not serve in any meaningful way.  Given the statutes and regulations currently in effect, Buckley’s fear that an individual might “contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through . . . unearmarked contributions” to entities likely to support the candidate, 424 U. S., at 38, is far too speculative.  Even accepting Buckley’s circumvention theory, it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive “massive amounts of money” that could be traced back to a particular donor uninhibited by the aggregate limits.  The Government’s scenarios offered in support of that possibility are either illegal under current campaign finance laws or implausible.  Pp. 21–30.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				(3) The aggregate limits also violate the 
 
First Amendment because they are not “closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.”  Buckley, supra, at 25.  The Government argues that the aggregate limits prevent an individual from giving to too many initial recipients who might then recontribute a donation, but experience suggests that the vast majority of contributions are retained and spent by their recipients.  And the Government has provided no reason to believe that candidates or party committees would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted.  The indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate limits is thus disproportionate to the Government’s interest in preventing circumvention. 
			 
 
				
				    
				Importantly, there are multiple alternatives available to Congress that would serve the Government’s interest in preventing circumvention while avoiding “unnecessary abridgment” of 
 
First Amendment rights.  Buckley, supra, at 25.  Such alternatives might include targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political committees, or tighter earmarking rules.  Transfers, after all, are the key to the Government’s concern about circumvention, but they can be addressed without such a direct and broad interference with 
 
First Amendment rights.  Pp. 30–35.
			 
 
				
				    
				
				    
				(4) Disclosure of contributions also reduces the potential for abuse of the campaign finance system.  Disclosure requirements, which are justified by “a governmental interest in ‘provid[ing] the electorate with information’ about the sources of election-related spending,” Citizens United, supra, at 367, may deter corruption “by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity,” Buckley, supra at 67.  Disclosure requirements may burden speech, but they often represent a less restrictive alternative to flat bans on certain types or quantities of speech.  Particularly with modern technology, disclosure now offers more robust protections against corruption than it did when Buckley was decided.  Pp. 35–36.
			 
 
				
				    
				(d) The Government offers an additional rationale for the aggregate limits, arguing that the opportunity for corruption exists whenever a legislator is given a large check, even if the check consists of contributions within the base limits to be divided among numerous candidates or committees.  That rationale dangerously broadens the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in prior cases.  Buckley confined its analysis to the possibility that “massive amounts of money” could be funneled to a particular candidate in excess of the base limits.  424 U. S., at 38.  Recasting as corruption a donor’s widely distributed support for a political party would dramatically expand government regulation of the political process.  And though the Government suggests that solicitation of large contributions poses the corruption danger, the aggregate limits are not limited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate.  Pp. 36–39.
			 
 
				
				    
				Justice Thomas agreed that the aggregate limits are invalid under the 
 
First Amendment, but would overrule Buckley v. Valeo, 

424 U. S. 1
, and subject BCRA’s aggregate limits to strict scrutiny, which they would surely fail.  Buckley’s “analytic foundation . . . was tenuous from the very beginning and has only continued to erode in the intervening years.”  Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 

528 U. S. 377
 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Contributions and expenditures are simply “two sides of the same 
 
First Amendment coin,” and this Court’s efforts to distinguish the two have produced mere “word games” rather than any cognizable constitutional law principle.  Buckley, supra, at 241, 244 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Pp. 1–5.
			 
 
				
				    
				Roberts, C. J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 Syllabus 
 TOWN OF GREECE, NEW YORK v. GALLOWAY et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
 No. 12–696. Argued November 6, 2013—Decided May 5, 2014 
 Since 1999, the monthly town board meetings in Greece, New York, have opened with a roll call, a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and a prayer given by clergy selected from the congregations listed in a local directory.  While the prayer program is open to all creeds, nearly all of the local congregations are Christian; thus, nearly all of the participating prayer givers have been too.  Respondents, citizens who attend meetings to speak on local issues, filed suit, alleging that the town violated the
 
First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by preferring Christians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring sectarian prayers.  They sought to limit the town to “inclusive and ecumenical” prayers that referred only to a “generic God.”  The District Court upheld the prayer practice on summary judgment, finding no impermissible preference for Christianity; concluding that the Christian identity of most of the prayer givers reflected the predominantly Christian character of the town’s congregations, not an official policy or practice of discriminating against minority faiths; finding that the
 
First Amendment did not require Greece to invite clergy from congregations beyond its borders to achieve religious diversity; and rejecting the theory that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian.  The Second Circuit reversed, holding that some aspects of the prayer program, viewed in their totality by a reasonable observer, conveyed the message that Greece was endorsing Christianity.   
 Held: The judgment is reversed. 
 681 F. 3d 20, reversed. 
 
            
        Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part II–B, concluding that the town’s prayer practice does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp. 6–18. 
 
            
        (a) Legislative prayer, while religious in nature, has long been understood as compatible with the Establishment Clause.  Marsh v. Chambers,

463 U. S. 783
.  In Marsh, the Court concluded that it was not necessary to define the Establishment Clause’s precise boundary in order to uphold Nebraska’s practice of employing a legislative chaplain because history supported the conclusion that the specific practice was permitted.  The First Congress voted to appoint and pay official chaplains shortly after approving language for the
 
First Amendment, and both Houses have maintained the office virtually uninterrupted since then.  See id., at 787–789, and n. 10.  A majority of the States have also had a consistent practice of legislative prayer.  Id., at 788–790, and n. 11.  There is historical precedent for the practice of opening local legislative meetings with prayer as well.  Marsh teaches that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted “by reference to historical practices and understandings.”  County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,

492 U. S. 573
 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  Thus, any test must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change.  The Court’s inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer practice in the town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.  Pp. 6–9. 
 
            
        (b) Respondents’ insistence on nonsectarian prayer is not consistent with this tradition.  The prayers in Marsh were consistent with the
 
First Amendment not because they espoused only a generic theism but because the Nation’s history and tradition have shown that prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t] with the principles of disestablishment and religious freedom.”  463 U. S., at 786.  Dictum in County of Allegheny suggesting that Marsh permitted only prayer with no overtly Christian references is irreconcilable with the facts, holding, and reasoning of Marsh, which instructed that the “content of the prayer is not of concern to judges,” provided “there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.”  463 U. S., at 794–795.  To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian would force the legislatures sponsoring prayers and the courts deciding these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech, thus involving government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither editing nor approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact.  Respondents’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive.  It is doubtful that consensus could be reached as to what qualifies as a generic or nonsectarian prayer.  It would also be unwise to conclude that only those religious words acceptable to the majority are permis-sible, for the
 
First Amendment is not a majority rule and government may not seek to define permissible categories of religious speech.  In rejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian, the Court does not imply that no constraints remain on its content.  The relevant constraint derives from the prayer’s place at the opening of legislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage.  From the Nation’s earliest days, invocations have been addressed to assemblies comprising many different creeds, striving for the idea that people of many faiths may be united in a community of tolerance and devotion, even if they disagree as to religious doctrine.  The prayers delivered in Greece do not fall outside this tradition.  They may have invoked, e.g., the name of Jesus, but they also invoked universal themes, e.g., by calling for a “spirit of cooperation.”  Absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a particular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation.  See 463 U. S., at 794–795.  Finally, so long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing.  Pp. 9–18. 
 
            
        Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded in Part II–B that a fact-sensitive inquiry that considers both the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed shows that the town is not coercing its citizens to engage in a religious observance.  The prayer opportunity is evaluated against the backdrop of a historical practice showing that prayer has become part of the Nation’s heritage and tradition.  It is presumed that the reasonable observer is acquainted with this tradition and understands that its purposes are to lend gravity to public proceedings and to acknowledge the place religion holds in the lives of many private citizens.  Furthermore, the principal audience for these invocations is not the public, but the lawmakers themselves.  And those lawmakers did not direct the public to participate, single out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicate that their decisions might be influenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity.  Respondents claim that the prayers gave them offense and made them feel excluded and disrespected, but offense does not equate to coercion.  In contrast to Lee v. Weisman,

505 U. S. 577
, where the Court found coercive a religious invocation at a high school graduation, id., at 592–594, the record here does not suggest that citizens are dissuaded from leaving the meeting room during the prayer, arriving late, or making a later protest.  That the prayer in Greece is delivered during the opening ceremonial portion of the town’s meeting, not the policymaking portion, also suggests that its purpose and effect are to acknowledge religious leaders and their institutions, not to exclude or coerce nonbelievers.  Pp. 18–23. 
 
            
        Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia as to Part II, agreed that the town’s prayer practice does not violate the Establishment Clause, but concluded that, even if the Establishment Clause were properly incorporated against the States through the
 
Fourteenth Amendment, the Clause is not violated by the kind of subtle pressures respondents allegedly suffered, which do not amount to actual legal coercion.  The municipal prayers in this case bear no resemblance to the coercive state establishments that existed at the founding, which exercised government power in order to exact financial support of the church, compel religious observance, or control religious doctrine.  Pp. 1–8. 
 
            
        Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part II–B.  Roberts, C. J., and Alito, J., joined the opinion in full, and Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined except as to Part II–B.  Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Scalia, J., joined.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Scalia, J., joined as to Part II.  Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion.  Kagan, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 Syllabus 
 WOOD et al. v. MOSS et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
 No. 13–115. Argued March 26, 2014—Decided May 27, 2014 
 While campaigning for a second term, President George W. Bush was scheduled to spend the night at a Jacksonville, Oregon, cottage.  Local law enforcement officials permitted a group of Bush supporters and a group of protesters to assemble on opposite sides of a street along the President’s motorcade route.  When the President made a last-minute decision to have dinner at the outdoor patio area of the Jacksonville Inn’s restaurant before resuming the drive to the cottage, the protesters moved to an area in front of the Inn, which placed them within weapons range of the President.  The supporters remained in their original location, where a two-story building blocked sight of, and weapons access to, the patio.  At the direction of two Secret Service agents responsible for the President’s security, petitioners here (the agents), local police cleared the area where the protesters had gathered, eventually moving them two blocks away to a street beyond weapons reach of the President.  The agents did not require the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay clear of the patio, or go through a security screening.  After the President dined, his motorcade passed the supporters, but the protesters, now two blocks from the motorcade’s route, were beyond his sight and hearing.  
 
            
        
            
        The protesters sued the agents for damages, alleging that the agents engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the
 
First Amendment when they moved the protesters away from the Inn but allowed the supporters to remain in their original location.  The District Court denied the agents’ motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim and on qualified immunity grounds, but on interlocutory appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court held that the protesters had failed to state a
 
First Amendment claim under the plead-ing standards of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,

550 U. S. 544
, and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,

556 U. S. 662
.  Because those decisions were rendered after the protesters commenced suit, the Court of Appeals granted leave to amend the complaint.  On remand, the protesters supplemented the complaint with allegations that the agents acted pursuant to an unwritten Secret Service policy of working with the Bush White House to inhibit the expression of disfavored views at presidential appearances.  The District Court denied the agents’ renewed motion to dismiss.  This time, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that viewpoint-driven conduct on the agents’ part could be inferred from the absence of a legitimate security rationale for the different treatment accorded the two groups of demonstrators.  The Court of Appeals further held that the agents were not entitled to qualified immunity because this Court’s precedent made clear that the Government may not regulate speech based on its content. 
 Held: The agents are entitled to qualified immunity.  Pp. 11–18. 
 
            
        (a) Government officials may not exclude from public places persons engaged in peaceful expressive activity solely because the government actor fears, dislikes, or disagrees with the views expressed.  See, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,

408 U. S. 92
.  The fundamental right to speak, however, does not leave people at liberty to publicize their views “ ‘whenever and however and wherever they please.’ ”  United States v. Grace,

461 U. S. 171
.  In deciding whether the protesters have alleged violation of a clearly established
 
First Amendment right, this Court assumes without deciding that Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,

403 U. S. 388
, which involved alleged
 
Fourth Amendment violations, extends to
 
First Amendment claims, see, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 675. 
 
            
        The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages “unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the challenged conduct.”  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___.  The “dispositive inquiry . . . is whether it would [have been] clear to a reasonable officer” in the agents’ position “that [their] conduct was unlawful in the situation [they] confronted.”  Saucier v. Katz,

533 U. S. 194
.  At the time of the Jacksonville incident, this Court had addressed a constitutional challenge to Secret Service actions only once.  In Hunter v. Bryant,

502 U. S. 224
, the plaintiff challenged the lawfulness of his arrest by two Secret Service agents for writing and delivering a letter about a plot to assassinate President Reagan.  Holding that the agents were shielded by qualified immunity, the Court stated that “accommodation for reasonable error . . . is nowhere more important than when the specter of Presidential assassination is raised.”  Id., at 229.  This Court has recognized the overwhelming importance of safeguarding the President in other contexts as well.  See Watts v. United States,

394 U. S. 705
.  Mindful that officers may be faced with unanticipated security situations, the key question addressed is whether it should have been clear to the agents that the security perimeter they established violated the
 
First Amendment.  Pp. 11–13. 
 
            
        (b) The protesters assert, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that the agents violated clearly established federal law by denying them “equal access to the President.”  No decision of which the Court is aware, however, would alert Secret Service agents engaged in crowd control that they bear a
 
First Amendment obligation to make sure that groups with conflicting views are at all times in equivalent positions.  Nor would the maintenance of equal access make sense in the situation the agents here confronted, where only the protesters, not the supporters, had a direct line of sight to the patio where the President was dining.  The protesters suggest that the agents could have moved the supporters out of the motorcade’s range as well, but there would have been no security rationale for such a move.  Pp. 13–15. 
 
            
        (c) The protesters allege that, in directing their displacement, the agents acted not to ensure the President’s safety, but to insulate the President from their message.  These allegations are undermined by a map of the area, which shows that, because of the protesters’ location, they posed a potential security risk to the President, while the supporters, because of their location, did not.  The protesters’ counterarguments are unavailing.  They urge that, had the agents’ professed interest in the President’s safety been sincere, the agents would have screened or removed from the premises persons already at the Inn when the President arrived.  But staff, other diners, and Inn guests were on the premises before the agents knew of the President’s plans, and thus could not have anticipated seeing the President, no less causing harm to him.  The agents also could keep a close watch on the relatively small number of people already inside the Inn, surveillance that would have been impossible for the hundreds of people outside the Inn.  A White House manual directs the President’s advance team to “work with the Secret Service . . . to designate a protest area . . . preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route.”  The manual guides the conduct of the political advance team, not the Secret Service, whose own written guides explicitly prohibit “agents from discriminating between anti-government and pro-government demonstrators.”  Even assuming, as the protesters maintain, that other agents, at other times and places, have assisted in shielding the President from political speech, this case is scarcely one in which the agents lacked a valid security reason for their ac-tions.  Moreover, because individual government officials “cannot be held liable” in a Bivens suit “unless they themselves acted [unconstitutionally],” Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 683, this Court declines to infer from alleged instances of misconduct on the part of particular agents an unwritten Secret Service policy to suppress disfavored expression, and then attribute that supposed policy to all field-level operatives.  Pp. 15–18. 
 711 F. 3d 941, reversed. 
 
            
        Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 Syllabus 
 McCULLEN et al. v. COAKLEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS, et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
 No. 12–1168. Argued January 15, 2014—Decided June 26, 2014 
 In 2007, Massachusetts amended its Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act, which had been enacted in 2000 to address clashes between abortion opponents and advocates of abortion rights outside clinics where abortions were performed.  The amended version of the Act makes it a crime to knowingly stand on a “public way or sidewalk” within 35 feet of an entrance or driveway to any “reproductive health care facility,” defined as “a place, other than within or upon the grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or performed.”  Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §§120E½(a), (b).  The Act exempts from this prohibition four classes of individuals, including “employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment.”  §120E½(b)(2).  Another provision of the Act proscribes the knowing obstruction of access to an abortion clinic.  §120E½(e). 
 
            
        
            
        McCullen and the other petitioners are individuals who attempt to engage women approaching Massachusetts abortion clinics in “sidewalk counseling,” which involves offering information about alternatives to abortion and help pursuing those options.  They claim that the 35-foot buffer zones have displaced them from their previous positions outside the clinics, considerably hampering their counseling efforts.  Their attempts to communicate with patients are further thwarted, they claim, by clinic “escorts,” who accompany arriving patients through the buffer zones to the clinic entrances.   
 
            
        
            
        Petitioners sued Attorney General Coakley and other Commonwealth officials, seeking to enjoin the Act’s enforcement on the ground that it violates the First and
 
Fourteenth Amendments, both on its face and as applied to them.  The District Court denied both challenges, and the First Circuit affirmed.  With regard to petitioners’ facial challenge, the First Circuit held that the Act was a reasonable “time, place, and manner” regulation under the test set forth in Ward v. Rock Against Racism,

491 U. S. 781
.   
 Held: The Massachusetts Act violates the
 
First Amendment.  Pp. 8–30. 
 
            
        (a) By its very terms, the Act restricts access to “public way[s]” and “sidewalk[s],” places that have traditionally been open for speech activities and that the Court has accordingly labeled “traditional public fora,” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,

555 U. S. 460
.  The government’s ability to regulate speech in such locations is “very limited.”  United States v. Grace,

461 U. S. 171
, 177.  “[E]ven in a public forum,” however, “the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions ‘are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information,’ ” Ward, supra, at 791.  Pp. 8–10. 
 
            
        (b) Because the Act is neither content nor viewpoint based, it need not be analyzed under strict scrutiny.  Pp. 10–18. 
 
            
        
            
        (1) The Act is not content based simply because it establishes buffer zones only at abortion clinics, as opposed to other kinds of facilities.  First, the Act does not draw content-based distinctions on its face.  Whether petitioners violate the Act “depends” not “on what they say,” Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project,

561 U. S. 1
, but on where they say it.  Second, even if a facially neutral law disproportionately affects speech on certain topics, it remains content neutral so long as it is “ ‘justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.’ ”  Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,

475 U. S. 41
.  The Act’s purposes include protecting public safety, patient access to healthcare, and unobstructed use of public sidewalks and streets.  The Court has previously deemed all these concerns to be content neutral.  See Boos v. Barry,

485 U. S. 312
.  An intent to single out for regulation speech about abortion cannot be inferred from the Act’s limited scope.  “States adopt laws to address the problems that confront them.”  Burson v. Freeman,

504 U. S. 191
.  There was a record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence outside Massachusetts abortion clinics but not at other kinds of facilities in the Commonwealth.  Pp. 11–15. 
 
            
        
            
        (2) The Act’s exemption for clinic employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment does not appear to be an attempt to favor one viewpoint about abortion over the other.  City of Ladue v. Gilleo,

512 U. S. 43
, distinguished.  Given that some kind of exemption was necessary to allow individuals who work at the clinics to enter or remain within the buffer zones, the “scope of employment” qualification simply ensures that the exemption is limited to its purpose of allowing the employees to do their jobs.  Even assuming that some clinic escorts have expressed their views on abortion inside the zones, the record does not suggest that such speech was within the scope of the escorts’ employment.  If it turned out that a particular clinic authorized its employees to speak about abortion in the buffer zones, that would support an as-applied challenge to the zones at that clinic.  Pp. 15–18.   
 
            
        (c) Although the Act is content neutral, it is not “narrowly tailored” because it “burden[s] substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate interests.”  Ward, 491 U. S., at 799.  Pp. 18–29.   
 
            
        
            
        (1) The buffer zones serve the Commonwealth’s legitimate interests in maintaining public safety on streets and sidewalks and in preserving access to adjacent reproductive healthcare facilities.  See Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y.,

519 U. S. 357
.  At the same time, however, they impose serious burdens on petitioners’ speech, depriving them of their two primary methods of communicating with arriving patients: close, personal conversations and distribution of literature.  Those forms of expression have historically been closely associated with the transmission of ideas.  While the Act may allow petitioners to “protest” outside the buffer zones, petitioners are not protestors; they seek not merely to express their opposition to abortion, but to engage in personal, caring, consensual conversations with women about various alternatives.  It is thus no answer to say that petitioners can still be seen and heard by women within the buffer zones.  If all that the women can see and hear are vociferous opponents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively stifled petitioners’ message.  Pp. 19–23. 
 
            
        
            
        (2) The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than necessary to achieve the Commonwealth’s asserted interests.  Subsection (e) of the Act already prohibits deliberate obstruction of clinic entrances.  Massachusetts could also enact legislation similar to the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994,

18 U. S. C. §248(a)(1), which imposes criminal and civil sanctions for obstructing, intimidating, or interfering with persons obtaining or providing reproductive health services.  Obstruction of clinic driveways can readily be addressed through existing local traffic ordinances.  While the Commonwealth contends that individuals can inadvertently obstruct access to clinics simply by gathering in large numbers, that problem could be addressed through a law requiring crowds blocking a clinic entrance to disperse for a limited period when ordered to do so by the police.  In any event, crowding appears to be a problem only at the Boston clinic, and even there, only on Saturday mornings. 
 
            
        The Commonwealth has not shown that it seriously undertook to address these various problems with the less intrusive tools readily available to it.  It identifies not a single prosecution or injunction against individuals outside abortion clinics since the 1990s.  The Commonwealth responds that the problems are too widespread for individual prosecutions and injunctions to be effective.  But again, the record indicates that the problems are limited principally to the Boston clinic on Saturday mornings, and the police there appear perfectly capable of singling out lawbreakers.  The Commonwealth also claims that it would be difficult to prove intentional or deliberate obstruction or intimidation and that the buffer zones accordingly make the police’s job easier.  To meet the narrow tailoring requirement, however, the government must demonstrate that alternative measures that burden substantially less speech would fail to achieve the government’s interests, not simply that the chosen route is easier.  In any event, to determine whether someone intends to block access to a clinic, a police officer need only order him to move; if he refuses, then there is no question that his continued conduct is knowing or intentional.  For similar reasons, the Commonwealth’s reliance on Burson v. Freeman,

504 U. S. 191
, is misplaced.  There, the Court upheld a law establishing buffer zones outside polling places on the ground that less restrictive measures were inadequate.  But whereas “[v]oter intimidation and election fraud” are “difficult to detect,” id., at 208, obstruction and harassment at abortion clinics are anything but subtle.  And while the police “generally are barred from the vicinity of the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in the electoral process,” id., at 207, they maintain a significant presence outside Massachusetts abortion clinics.  In short, given the vital
 
First Amendment interests at stake, it is not enough for Massachusetts simply to say that other approaches have not worked.  Pp. 23–29.

 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 Syllabus 
 BURWELL, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al. v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC., et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
 No. 13–354. Argued March 25, 2014—Decided June 30, 2014[ 1 ] 
 The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) prohibits the “Government [from] substantially burden[ing] a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless the Government “demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”  42 U. S. C. §§2000bb–1(a), (b).  As amended by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), RFRA covers “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.”  §2000cc–5(7)(A). 
 
            
        
            
        At issue here are regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which, as relevant here, requires specified employers’ group health plans to furnish “preventive care and screenings” for women without “any cost sharing requirements,”

42 U. S. C. §300gg–13(a)(4).  Congress did not specify what types of preventive care must be covered; it authorized the Health Resources and Services Administration, a component of HHS, to decide.  Ibid.  Nonexempt employers are generally required to provide coverage for the 20 contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including the 4 that may have the effect of preventing an already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its attachment to the uterus.  Religious employers, such as churches, are exempt from this contraceptive mandate.  HHS has also effectively exempted religious nonprofit organizations with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.  Under this accommodation, the insurance issuer must exclude contraceptive coverage from the employer’s plan and provide plan participants with separate payments for contraceptive services without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the employer, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries.  
 
            
        
            
        In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point.  In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives.  In No. 13–356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company—Conestoga Wood Specialties—a preliminary injunction.  Affirming, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not “engage in religious exercise” under RFRA or the
 
First Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity.  In No. 13–354, the Greens, their children, and their companies—Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel—were also denied a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed.  It held that the Greens’ businesses are “persons” under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the “least restrictive means” of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  
 Held: As applied to closely held corporations, the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violate RFRA.  Pp. 16–49. 
 
            
        (a) RFRA applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely held for-profit corporations like Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel.  Pp. 16–31. 
 
            
        
            
        (1) HHS argues that the companies cannot sue because they are for-profit corporations, and that the owners cannot sue because the regulations apply only to the companies, but that would leave merchants with a difficult choice: give up the right to seek judicial protection of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits of operating as corporations.  RFRA’s text shows that Congress designed the statute to provide very broad protection for religious liberty and did not intend to put merchants to such a choice.  It employed the familiar legal fiction of including corporations within RFRA’s definition of “persons,” but the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the rights of people associated with the corporation, including shareholders, officers, and employees.  Protecting the free-exercise rights of closely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control them.  Pp. 16–19. 
 
            
        
            
        (2) HHS and the dissent make several unpersuasive arguments.  Pp. 19–31. 
 
            
        
            
        
            
        (i) Nothing in RFRA suggests a congressional intent to depart from the Dictionary Act definition of “person,” which “include[s] corporations, . . . as well as individuals.”

1 U. S. C. §1.  The Court has entertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by nonprofit corporations.  See, e.g., Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficiente União do Vegetal,

546 U. S. 418
.  And HHS’s concession that a nonprofit corporation can be a “person” under RFRA effectively dispatches any argument that the term does not reach for-profit corporations; no conceivable definition of “person” includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations.  Pp. 19–20. 
 
            
        
            
        
            
        (ii) HHS and the dissent nonetheless argue that RFRA does not cover Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel because they cannot “exercise . . . religion.”  They offer no persuasive explanation for this conclusion.  The corporate form alone cannot explain it because RFRA indisputably protects nonprofit corporations.  And the profit-making objective of the corporations cannot explain it because the Court has entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who were attempting to make a profit as retail merchants.  Braunfeld v. Brown,

366 U. S. 599
.  Business practices compelled or limited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within the understanding of the “exercise of religion” that this Court set out in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith,

494 U. S. 872
.  Any suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law.  States, including those in which the plaintiff corporations were incorporated, authorize corporations to pursue any lawful purpose or business, including the pursuit of profit in conformity with the owners’ religious principles.  Pp. 20–25. 
 
            
        
            
        
            
        (iii) Also flawed is the claim that RFRA offers no protection because it only codified pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause precedents, none of which squarely recognized free-exercise rights for for-profit corporations.  First, nothing in RFRA as originally enacted suggested that its definition of “exercise of religion” was meant to be tied to pre-Smith interpretations of the
 
First Amendment.  Second, if RFRA’s original text were not clear enough, the RLUIPA amendment surely dispels any doubt that Congress intended to separate the definition of the phrase from that in
 
First Amendment case law.  Third, the pre-Smith case of Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.,

366 U. S. 617
, suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations can exercise religion.  Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA, a law enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, merely restored this Court’s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form and restricted RFRA claims to plaintiffs who fell within a category of plaintiffs whose claims the Court had recognized before Smith.  Pp. 25–28. 
 
            
        
            
        (3) Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because of the difficulty of ascertaining the “beliefs” of large, publicly traded corporations, but HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring.  HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations from RFRA’s protection.  That disputes among the owners of corporations might arise is not a problem unique to this context.  State corporate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing structure.  Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state law in resolving disputes.  Pp. 29–31. 
 
            
        (b) HHS’s contraceptive mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion.  Pp. 31–38. 
 
            
        
            
        (1) It requires the Hahns and Greens to engage in conduct that seriously violates their sincere religious belief that life begins at conception.  If they and their companies refuse to provide contraceptive coverage, they face severe economic consequences: about $475 million per year for Hobby Lobby, $33 million per year for Conestoga, and $15 million per year for Mardel.  And if they drop coverage altogether, they could face penalties of roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.  P. 32. 
 
            
        
            
        (2) Amici supporting HHS argue that the $2,000 per-employee penalty is less than the average cost of providing insurance, and therefore that dropping insurance coverage eliminates any substantial burden imposed by the mandate.  HHS has never argued this and the Court does not know its position with respect to the argument.  But even if the Court reached the argument, it would find it unpersuasive:  It ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have religious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees, and it is far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insurance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying the ACA penalty.  Pp. 32–35. 
 
            
        
            
        (3) HHS argues that the connection between what the objecting parties must do and the end that they find to be morally wrong is too attenuated because it is the employee who will choose the coverage and contraceptive method she uses.  But RFRA’s question is whether the mandate imposes a substantial burden on the objecting parties’ ability to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs.  The belief of the Hahns and Greens implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.  It is not for the Court to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or unreasonable.  In fact, this Court considered and rejected a nearly identical argument in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,

450 U. S. 707
.  The Court’s “narrow function . . . is to determine” whether the plaintiffs’ asserted religious belief reflects “an honest conviction,” id., at 716, and there is no dispute here that it does.  Tilton v. Richardson,

403 U. S. 672
; and Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,

392 U. S. 236
–249, distinguished.  Pp. 35–38. 
 
            
        (c) The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is a compelling governmental interest, but the Government has failed to show that the contraceptive mandate is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.  Pp. 38–49. 
 
            
        
            
        (1) The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA.  Pp. 39–40. 
 
            
        
            
        (2) The Government has failed to satisfy RFRA’s least-restrictive-means standard.  HHS has not shown that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion.  The Government could, e.g., assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives to women unable to obtain coverage due to their employers’ religious objections.  Or it could extend the accommodation that HHS has already established for religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate.  That accommodation does not impinge on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion and it still serves HHS’s stated interests.  Pp. 40–45. 
 
            
        
            
        (3) This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, e.g., for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily fall if they conflict with an employer’s religious beliefs.  Nor does it provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice.  United States v. Lee,

455 U. S. 252
, which upheld the payment of Social Security taxes despite an employer’s religious objection, is not analogous.  It turned primarily on the special problems associated with a national system of taxation; and if Lee were a RFRA case, the fundamental point would still be that there is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes.  Here, there is an alternative to the contraceptive mandate.  Pp. 45–49.

 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
 Syllabus 
 LANE v. FRANKS et al. 
 certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
 No. 13–483. Argued April 28, 2014—Decided June 19, 2014 
 As Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a program for underprivileged youth operated by Central Alabama Community College (CACC), petitioner Edward Lane conducted an audit of the program’s expenses and discovered that Suzanne Schmitz, an Alabama State Representative on CITY’s payroll, had not been reporting for work.  Lane eventually terminated Schmitz’ employment.  Shortly thereafter, federal authorities indicted Schmitz on charges of mail fraud and theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.  Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz.  Schmitz was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison.  Meanwhile, CITY was experiencing significant budget shortfalls.  Respondent Franks, then CACC’s president, terminated Lane along with 28 other employees in a claimed effort to address the financial difficulties.  A few days later, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations—those of Lane and one other employee.  Lane sued Franks in his individual and official capacities under

42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that Franks had violated the
 
First Amendment by firing him in retaliation for testifying against Schmitz. 
 
            
        
            
        The District Court granted Franks’ motion for summary judgment, holding that the individual-capacity claims were barred by qualified immunity and the official-capacity claims were barred by the
 
Eleventh Amendment.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that Lane’s testimony was not entitled to
 
First Amendment protection.  It reasoned that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen because he acted pursuant to his official duties when he investigated and terminated Schmitz’ employment. 
 Held:  
 
            
        1. Lane’s sworn testimony outside the scope of his ordinary job duties is entitled to
 
First Amendment protection.  Pp. 6–13. 
 
            
        
            
        (a) Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,

391 U. S. 563
, requires balancing “the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.”  Under the first step of the Pickering analysis, if the speech is made pursuant to the employee’s ordinary job duties, then the employee is not speaking as a citizen for
 
First Amendment purposes, and the inquiry ends.  Garcetti v. Ceballos,

547 U. S. 410
.  But if the “employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,” the inquiry turns to “whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.”  Id., at 418.  Pp. 6–8. 
 
            
        
            
        (b) Lane’s testimony is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  Pp. 8–12. 
 
            
        
            
        
            
        (1) Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential example of citizen speech for the simple reason that anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation, to the court and society at large, to tell the truth.  That obligation is distinct and independent from any separate obligations a testifying public employee might have to his employer.  The Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too broadly in holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified simply because he learned of the subject matter of that testimony in the course of his employment.  Garcetti said nothing about speech that relates to public employment or concerns information learned in the course of that employment.  The critical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee’s duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.  Indeed, speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge of matters of public concern through their employment.  Pp. 9–11. 
 
            
        
            
        
            
        (2) Whether speech is a matter of public concern turns on the “content, form, and context” of the speech.  Connick v. Myers,

461 U. S. 138
–148.  Here, corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds obviously involve matters of significant public concern.  See Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 425.  And the form and context of the speech—sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding—fortify that conclusion.  See United States v. Alvarez, 567 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp. 11–12. 
 
            
        
            
        (c) Turning to Pickering’s second step, the employer’s side of the scale is entirely empty.  Respondents do not assert, and cannot demonstrate, any government interest that tips the balance in their favor—for instance, evidence that Lane’s testimony was false or erro-neous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed sensitive, confidential, or privileged information while testifying.  Pp. 12–13. 
 
            
        2. Franks is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against him in his individual capacity.  The question here is whether Franks reasonably could have believed that, when he fired Lane, a government employer could fire an employee because of testimony the employee gave, under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities.  See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___.  At the relevant time, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not preclude Franks from holding that belief, and no decision of this Court was sufficiently clear to cast doubt on controlling Circuit precedent.  Any discrepancies in Eleventh Circuit precedent only serve to highlight the dispositive point that the question was not beyond debate at the time Franks acted.  Pp. 13–17. 
 
            
        3. The Eleventh Circuit declined to consider the District Court’s dismissal of the claims against respondent Burrow in her official capacity as CACC’s acting president, and the parties have not asked this Court to consider them here.  The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit as to those claims is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.  P. 17. 
 523 Fed. Appx. 709, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. 
 
            
        Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Scalia and Alito, JJ., joined.
